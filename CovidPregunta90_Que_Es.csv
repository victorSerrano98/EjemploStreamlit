This has been mainly achieved by some fixed word selection strategy in the previous studies for ED. In this work, we propose a novel method that learns to select relevant context words for ED based on the Gumbel-Softmax trick. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, leading to the state-of-the-art performance for ED over different benchmark datasets and settings.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206272/;17/4/2020;event detection;0.9785

They cut across demographic and political differences (Uscinski and Parent, 2014) and can have negative social/political consequences. For example, Imhoff and Lamberty (2020) find that belief that the seriousness of COVID-19 is being exaggerated is negatively correlated with self-reported preventative behaviours such as hand washing and social distancing, and belief that the virus was intentionally created by humans is positively correlated with self-reported hoarding of food, sanitary products, and gasoline/oil, as well as stocking up on weapons.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338396/;11/6/2020;Conspiracy theories;0.9227

We found that cities that suffered from SARS and have greater migration ties to the epicentre, Wuhan, had earlier, stronger and more durable public awareness of the outbreak. Our data indicate that forty-eight such cities developed awareness up to 19 days earlier than 255 comparable cities, giving them an opportunity to better prepare. This study suggests that it is important to consider memory of prior catastrophic events as they will influence the public response to emerging threats.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033688;16/3/2020;coronavirus;0.9897

461;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Security;10.1007/978-1-4842-6655-7_9;In our experience, managing security effectively takes not only the right mindset but the right habits, practiced regularly. For instance, some organizations (and to an extent basic human nature) are reactive, and in the case of cybersecurity, it often gets more attention after a recent incident or breach. With cybersecurity, there are always new and evolving threats. Organizations that lose focus, becoming lax in applying the right habits regularly, can more easily fall prey to attackers and even a public breach. The contrary is also true—by applying the right habits regularly, an organization can continually minimize the probability of a breach.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989860/;31/12/2020;managing security;0.9031

Unfortunately, the patient contracted symptomatic COVID-19, resulting in postponement of lung resection. 6 weeks following acute infection she was admitted for surgery. A pre-operative computed tomography scan showed widespread interstitial pneumonitis. However, the surgery went ahead given concerns over tumour progression, albeit with a lesser resection to preserve lung tissue as the patient was slightly hypoxic. Her postoperative recovery was uneventful and she was discharged 5 days later.

542;[COMMENT] Respiratory diseases in the era of COVID-19: Pearls and pitfalls;10.3892/etm.2020.8776;Coronavirus disease 2019, a respiratory tract infection that has evolved into a pandemic, is expected to affect patients with underlying respiratory disease in a greater number and greater severity than patients with other underlying disorders. Whether this is true is an interesting question. However, the challenge both for the doctors and patients is to keep the respiratory disease in remission and prevent any exacerbations. Proper recommendations have been proposed for a wide range of respiratory disorders including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and interstitial lung diseases, regarding the continuation or not of the treatment during this period and ways to maintain stability.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742314/; https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2020.8776";20/5/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9823
543;COVID-19 in the heart and the lungs: could we “Notch” the inflammatory storm?;10.1007/s00395-020-0791-5;From January 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) originated in China has spread around the world. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The presence of myocarditis, cardiac arrest, and acute heart failure in COVID-19 patients suggests the existence of a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiac disease. The Notch signalling is a major regulator of cardiovascular function and it is also implicated in several biological processes mediating viral infections. In this report we discuss the possibility to target Notch signalling to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and interfere with the progression of COVID-19- associated heart and lungs disease.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32274570/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00395-020-0791-5";9/4/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9831
544;Air Pollution Reduction and Mortality Benefit during the COVID-19 Outbreak in China;10.1101/2020.03.23.20039842;To control the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, China undertook stringent traffic restrictions and self-quarantine measures. We herein examine the change in air pollution levels and the potentially avoided cause-specific mortality during this massive population quarantine episode. We found that, due to the quarantine, NO2 dropped by 22.8 {micro}g/m3 and 12.9 {micro}g/m3 in Wuhan and China, respectively. PM2.5 dropped by 1.4 {micro}g/m3 in Wuhan but decreased by 18.9 {micro}g/m3 across 367 cities. Our findings show that interventions to contain the COVID-19 outbreak led to air quality improvements that brought health benefits which outnumbered the confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 in China;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039842;27/3/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9396

Subsequent investigations revealed a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as the causative agent now at the heart of a major outbreak. The rising case numbers have been accompanied by unprecedented public health action, including the wholesale isolation of Wuhan. Alongside this has been a robust scientific response, including early publication of the pathogen genome, and rapid development of highly specific diagnostics.

630;Molecular Basis for ADP-ribose Binding to the Macro-X Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3;10.1101/2020.03.31.014639;The virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, has a large RNA genome that encodes numerous proteins that might be targets for antiviral drugs. Some of these proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helicase and main protease, are well conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS virus, but several others are not. This study examines one of the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 that is most different, a macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Although 26% of the amino acids in this SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain differ from those seen in other coronaviruses, biochemical and structural data reveal that the protein retains the ability to bind ADP-ribose, which is an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses, and potential therapeutic target.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.014639;29/4/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9513

Multiple studies suggest CT should be a primary diagnostic tool for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) because they reported sensitivities with CT far superior to that of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. This review aimed to assess these reports and found chest CT to have a clinical utility that is limited, particularly for patients who show no symptoms and patients who are screened early in disease progression. CONCLUSION. CT has limited sensitivity for COVID-19 and a lower specificity than RT-PCR testing, and it carries a risk of exposing providers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Chest CT should be considered a supplemental diagnostic tool, particularly for patients who show symptoms.;"https://doi.org/10.2214/ajr.20.23418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412790/";15/5/2020;coronavirus disease;0.984

Automated room disinfection (ARD) systems remove or reduce reliance on operators and so they have the potential to improve the efficacy of terminal disinfection. The most commonly used systems are hydrogen peroxide vapor (H2O2 vapor), aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP), and ultraviolet (UV) light. These systems have important differences in their active agent, delivery mechanism, efficacy, process time, and ease of use. The choice of ARD system should be influenced by the intended application, the evidence base for effectiveness, practicalities of implementation, and cost considerations.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780081025659000157; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081025659000157";31/12/2020;Automated room disinfection;0.9254

658;Impact of COVID-19 on Acute Inpatient Rehabilitation Caregiver Training.;10.48252/jcr2;Hospitals and rehabilitation centers around the world have been impacted by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Lockdown measures and strict quarantine from the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a shift in health care delivery to our patients. Additionally, the increased bed availability for Covid positive patients resulted in many rehabilitation beds being converted to acute medical beds. It also changed visitor policies to the hospital, which meant caregivers were completely absent and unavailable for the usual traditional in-person learning and training. We aim to describe barriers of discharging patients safely home during this pandemic and propose potential virtual and hybrid solutions to aid in training for safe discharges home for all hospitalized patients.;"https://doi.org/10.48252/jcr2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33665649/";1/1/2020;coronavirus SARS-CoV-2;0.9684
659;Short Communication An epidemiological model for SARS-CoV-2;10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.100836;Abstract The spread of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is here investigated from an epidemic model considering four pathways of person-to-person transmission. These pathways represent the propagation of this novel coronavirus by asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals. In this work, analytical expressions for the disease-free and endemic steady-states are derived. Also, the conditions for eradication of this contagious disease are determined. By taking into account realistic parameter values, the proposed model shows an oscillatory convergence to the endemic steady-state, which means the occurrence of a sequence of peaks in the number of sick individuals as time passes. These results are discussed from a public health standpoint.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476945X20300581?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1476945X20300581; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.100836";29/5/2020;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;0.9493

SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmissible as each person with COVID-19 infects approximately 2.2 close contacts, and asymptomatic transmission has been reported [2,3]. SARS-CoV-2 survives in aerosols and on surfaces from hours to days, respectively [4]. Therefore, we believe non-clinical areas are potentially high-risk for transmission between healthcare workers, and often neglected by infection prevention and control protocols.

This is a difficult task and although several estimation techniques have been proposed recently, they generally do not produce good results. In a previous comparative study, among several noise estimation techniques, a method proposed in 2017 by Turajlić was found to give the best results. Although acceptable, they are still far from ideal. Therefore, several changes to this method are introduced in this paper to improve the estimation. Tests on monochromatic images contaminated with different levels of Gaussian noise showed that the modified method produces a significant improvement in the estimation of Gaussian noise, over 35%, at a slightly higher computational cost.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297579/;29/4/2020;Gaussian noise estimation;0.9479

I challenge Häyry’s principle of actual or prospective existence. I also argue that Häyry should say more on human beings at the “margin of life” (such as fetuses and other mindless humans).

688;A new perspective in sepsis treatment: could RGD-dependent integrins be novel targets?;10.1016/j.drudis.2020.09.038;Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the response of the body to an infection, and has recently been regarded as a global health priority because of the lack of effective treatments available. Vascular endothelial cells have a crucial role in sepsis and are believed to be a major target of pathogens during the early stages of infection. Accumulating evidence suggests that common sepsis pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, all contain a critical integrin recognition motif, Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), in their major cell wall-exposed proteins that might act as ligands to crosslink to vascular endothelial cells, triggering systemic dysregulation resulting in sepsis. In this review, we discuss the potential of anti-integrin therapy in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359644620303925; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2020.09.038; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644620303925?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035665/";6/10/2020;Arg-Gly-Asp;0.9795

703;A Lower Bound on DNNF Encodings of Pseudo-Boolean Constraints;10.1007/978-3-030-51825-7_22;Two major considerations when encoding pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints into SAT are the size of the encoding and its propagation strength, that is, the guarantee that it has a good behaviour under unit propagation. Several encodings with propagation strength guarantees rely upon prior compilation of the constraints into DNNF (decomposable negation normal form), BDD (binary decision diagram), or some other sub-variants. However it has been shown that there exist PB-constraints whose ordered BDD (OBDD) representations, and thus the inferred CNF encodings, all have exponential size. Since DNNFs are more succinct than OBDDs, preferring encodings via DNNF to avoid size explosion seems a legitimate choice. Yet in this paper, we prove the existence of PB-constraints whose DNNFs all require exponential size.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326562/;26/6/2020;binary decision diagram;0.9698

Given the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, the availability of reliable information for clinicians and patients is of extreme importance Although accumulating evidence support the existence of a harmful effect of NSAIDs in some infectious settings, no clinical studies demonstrating that such risk applies in case of COVID-19. Pending further research, a pragmatic and cautionary approach would be to avoid regular NSAID use or as first line option in suspicion of COVID19 symptoms.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/09546634.2020.1800580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723104/";29/7/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9677
714;A novel approach to predict COVID-19 using support vector machine;10.1016/b978-0-12-824536-1.00014-9;An unexpected outbreak of 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, led to a massive catastrophe across the world. The majority of the COVID-19 patients are getting diagnosed with pneumonia in their early stages. Over 22,00,000 confirmed cases have shown various ranges of symptoms, but the most predominant set includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The predominant set of symptoms, coupled with other critical symptoms, a prediction process has been devised in this paper to check whether a person is infected with COVID-19 or not. Based on the crucial impact of the symptoms, we have applied the support vector machine classifier to classify the patient's condition in no infection, mild infection, and serious infection categories. We have achieved an accuracy of 87% in predicting the cases.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128245361000149; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128245361000149";21/5/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9583

716;Vine Disease Detection by Deep Learning Method Combined with 3D Depth Information;10.1007/978-3-030-51935-3_9;Vine disease detection (VDD) is an important asset to predict a probable contagion of virus or fungi. Diseases that spreads through the vineyard has a huge economic impact, therefore it is considered as a challenge for viticulture. Automatic detection and mapping of vine disease in earlier stage can help to limit its impact and reduces the use of chemicals. This study deals with the problem of locating symptomatic areas in images from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using the visible and infrared domains. This paper, proposes a new method, based on segmentation by a convolutional neuron network SegNet and a depth map (DM), to delineate the asymptomatic regions in the vine canopy. The results obtained showed that SegNet combined with the depth information give better accuracy than a SegNet segmentation alone.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340882/;5/6/2020;Vine disease detection;0.9931

718;Bias in Conversational Search: The Double-Edged Sword of the Personalized Knowledge Graph;10.1145/3409256.3409834;Conversational AI systems are being used in personal devices, providing users with highly personalized content. Personalized knowledge graphs (PKGs) are one of the recently proposed methods to store users' information in a structured form and tailor answers to their liking. Personalization, however, is prone to amplifying bias and contributing to the echo-chamber phenomenon. In this paper, we discuss different types of biases in conversational search systems, with the emphasis on the biases that are related to PKGs. We review existing definitions of bias in the literature: people bias, algorithm bias, and a combination of the two, and further propose different strategies for tackling these biases for conversational search systems. Finally, we discuss methods for measuring bias and evaluating user satisfaction.;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10409v1.pdf;20/10/2020;Personalized knowledge graphs;0.9458

This pandemic has proven to be a challenge given that there is no immediate cure, no vaccine is currently available and medications or treatments being used are still undergoing clinical trials. There have already been examples of self‐medication and overdose. Clearly, there is a need to further define the efficacy of treatments used in the management of COVID‐19.

For this purpose, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) was employed to evaluate the efficiency of the hotel industry on a provincial level in China and to analyze how it is impacted by specialization in tourism and market competition. The results confirm that tourism specialization and market competition exert a synergistic effect on hotel industry efficiency in China. This study finds that tourism development as represented by a high level of tourism specialization by a destination does not guarantee high efficiency in hotels but does enhance the negative effect of market competition on hotel industry efficiency.

To answer this question, we analyze the correlates of COVID-19 cases and deaths across US counties. We document four sets of facts. First, effective density is an important and persistent determinant of COVID-19 severity. Second, counties with more nursing home residents, lower income, higher poverty rates, and a greater presence of African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately impacted, and these effects show no sign of disappearing over time. Third, the effect of certain characteristics, such as the distance to major international airports and the share of elderly individuals, dies out over time.

For this purpose, bounded value iteration (BVI) attracts attention as an efficient iterative method. However, BVI’s performance is often impeded by costly end component (EC) computation that is needed to ensure convergence. Our contribution is a novel BVI algorithm that conducts, in addition to local propagation by the Bellman update that is typical of BVI, global propagation of upper bounds that is not hindered by ECs. To conduct global propagation in a computationally tractable manner, we construct a weighted graph and solve the widest path problem in it. Our experiments show the algorithm’s performance advantage over the previous BVI algorithms that rely on EC computation.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363239/;16/6/2020;bounded value iteration;0.9701

State and national policies have historically precluded equitable access to healthcare among children in immigrant families. More recently, increasingly restrictive policies, political rhetoric, and xenophobic stances have made immigrant families less able to access healthcare and less comfortable in attempting to do so, thus increasing the likelihood that patients will present to the emergency department (ED).

741;Hydrogen Sulfide and Carbon Monoxide Tolerance in Bacteria;10.3390/antiox10050729;Hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide share the ability to be beneficial or harmful molecules depending on the concentrations to which organisms are exposed. Interestingly, humans and some bacteria produce small amounts of these compounds. Since several publications have summarized the recent knowledge of its effects in humans, here we have chosen to focus on the role of H(2)S and CO on microbial physiology. We briefly review the current knowledge on how bacteria produce and use H(2)S and CO. We address their potential antimicrobial properties when used at higher concentrations, and describe how microbial systems detect and survive toxic levels of H(2)S and CO. Finally, we highlight their antimicrobial properties against human pathogens when endogenously produced by the host and when released by external chemical donors.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063102/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10050729";5/5/2021;microbial physiology;0.9658

743;Effect of Temperature on the Transmission of COVID-19: A Machine Learning Case Study in Spain;10.1101/2020.05.01.20087759;The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has already spread to almost every country in the world and has infected over 3 million people. To understand the transmission mechanism of this highly contagious virus, it is necessary to study the potential factors, including meteorological conditions. Here, we present a machine learning approach to study the effect of temperature, humidity and wind speed on the number of infected people in the three most populous autonomous communities in Spain. We find that there is a moderate inverse correlation between temperature and the daily number of infections. This correlation manifests for temperatures recorded up to 6 days before the onset, which corresponds well to the known mean incubation period of COVID-19. We also show that the correlation for humidity and wind speed is not significant.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.20087759; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.20087759v1?rss=1";6/5/2020;coronavirus;0.9119

Rhino-orbital mucormycosis is a rare angio-invasive fungal infection which has shown a rising trend in the setting of COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the imaging findings in 3 cases of rhino-orbital mucormycosis in patients with history of COVID-19. All cases had varying involvement of paranasal sinuses extending into the orbital compartment while case 3 had intracranial extension of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Rhino-orbital mucormycosis can have aggressive necrosis of the involved paranasal sinuses and orbits with or without cerebral extension. Hence, the correct diagnosis is imperative as prompt antifungal drugs and surgical debridement can significantly reduce mortality and morbidity.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217789/;22/6/2021;Coronavirus disease 2019;0.9106
751;Bayesian back-calculation and nowcasting for line list data during the COVID-19 pandemic;10.1101/2020.12.08.20238154;Surveillance is the key of controling the COVID-19 pandemic, and it typically suffers from reporting delays and thus can be misleading. Previous methods for adjusting reporting delays are not particularly appropriate for line list data, which usually have lots of missing values that are non-ignorable for modeling reporting delays. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach that dynamically integrates imputation and estimation for line list data. We show this Bayesian approach lead to accurate estimates of the epidemic curve and time-varying reproductive numbers and is robust to deviations from model assumptions. We apply the Bayesian approach to COVID-19 line list data in Massachusetts and find the reproductive number estimates correspond more closely to the control measures than the estimates based on the reported curve.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20238154v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.08.20238154";11/12/2020;Surveillance;0.9895

At the same time, microbial populations in the gut have been shown to have more physiological effects than we expected as “habitants” of the gut. The imbalance in the gut microbiome or dysbiosis, particularly when there are excessive harmful pathogens, can trigger not just infections but can also result in the development of common diseases, such as cancer and cardiometabolic diseases. By using FMT technology, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiome in patients can be resolved by administering fecal materials from a healthy donor. The current review summarizes the history and current uses of FMT before suggesting potential ideas for its high-quality application in clinical settings.;"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.519836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054740/";13/5/2021;Fecal microbiome transplant;0.9669

After initial discovery in RNA editing enzyme ADAR1, ZDBD has also been described in pathogen-sensing proteins ZBP1 and PKZ in host, as well as virulence proteins E3L and ORF112 in viruses. The host-virus antagonism immediately highlights the importance of ZDBD in antiviral innate immunity. Furthermore, Z-RNA binding has been shown to be responsible for the localization of these ZDBD-containing proteins to cytoplasmic stress granules that play central role in coordinating cellular response to stresses. This review sought to consolidate current understanding of Z-RNA sensing in innate immunity and implore possible roles of Z-RNA binding within cytoplasmic stress granules.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7886975/;3/2/2021;Z-DNA binding domain;0.986

MOT (Multi-Object Tracking) performance is heavily dependent on object detection. Once object detection gives false alarms or missing alarms, the multi-object tracking would be automatically influenced. In this paper, we propose a coupling system which combines 3D object detection and multi-object tracking into one framework. We use the tracked objects as a reference in 3D object detection, in order to locate objects, reduce false or missing alarms in a single frame, and weaken the impact of false and missing alarms on the tracking quality.

Numerous unique scFv clones capable of inhibiting binding of the viral S1 ectodomain to the ACE2 receptor in vitro were characterized. To maximize avidity, selected clones were reformatted as bivalent diabodies and monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The highest affinity mAb completely neutralized live SARS-CoV-2 virus in cell culture for four days at a concentration of 6.7 nM, suggesting potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic use. Furthermore, scFvs were identified that greatly increased the interaction of the viral S1 trimer with the ACE2 receptor, with potential implications for vaccine development.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.27.224089;28/7/2020;receptor binding domain;0.9425

To our interest, human coronaviruses are divided into four subgroups: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. There are seven strains of coronavirus that may infect humans. The common human strains that produce mild symptoms include 229E [alpha], NL63 [alpha], OC43 [beta], and HKU1 [beta]. In humans, the common sign and symptoms include cough, sore throat, fever, muscle ache, and difficulty in breathing. Some patients even may present with uncommon symptoms like anosmia, chest pain, and stroke. The severity of these symptoms can vary from very mild to very lethal ones like, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], and coronavirus disease [COVID-19].;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978886/;6/10/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9951

This paper aims to review the available literature and guidelines pertaining to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and the proposed guidelines, while offering a potential approach that unifies the available evidence. While the risk of VITT remains extremely low and the benefits outweigh the risks, experimental studies are needed to clarify the pathophysiology behind VITT and possibly decrease the risk of thrombosis and other adverse events occurring. However, treatment should not be delayed in suspected cases, and IV immunoglobulin and non-heparin anticoagulation should be initiated.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211025927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120531/";1/1/2021;coronavirus;0.9727

However, MOOCs dropout remains high. Prediction of student performance that could feed instructors’ dashboards and help them adapt their course structure and material, or trigger help and tailor interventions to specific groups of students, is a valuable research objective. Towards that end, this paper focuses on three predictive metrics (student attendance rate: [Formula: see text], utilization rate: [Formula: see text], and watching index: [Formula: see text]) of how students interact with MOOC videos in order to predict which group of students will pass or fail the course.

In this study, we follow novel approaches that target the absence of actionable insights by classifying reviews as defect reports and requests for improvement. Unlike traditional classification methods based on expert rules, we reduce the manual labour by employing a supervised system that is capable of learning lexico-semantic patterns through genetic programming. Additionally, we experiment with a distantly-supervised SVM that makes use of the noisy labels generated by patterns. Using a real-world dataset of app reviews, we show that the automatically learned patterns outperform the manually created ones. Also the distantly-supervised SVM models are not far behind the pattern-based solutions, showing the usefulness of this approach when the amount of annotated data is limited.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7298171/;26/5/2020;Online reviews;0.9017

Vaccination is the only option to prevent future surges of the disease. Efforts for developing an effective vaccine are underway, but the timeline for the widespread availability of safe and effective vaccines is unknown. Some ecological reports have linked regional universal use of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine with reduced morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.

823;Hate Crimes against Asian Americans;10.1007/s12103-020-09602-9;Using 1992–2014 data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), the present study examines the nature and characteristics of hate crimes against Asian Americans by comparing them with those of hate crimes against African Americans and Hispanics. Minority-general and minority-specific models are proposed to guide the analysis. The findings are mixed. The analyses of all victim-related and most offender-related variables show similarities of hate crimes against Asian Americans to those against African Americans and Hispanics. These findings provide support for the minority-general model. Offenders’ race and all incident-related variables of hate crimes against Asian Americans, however, differ significantly from those of hate crimes against African Americans and Hispanics. These significant differences provide support for the minority-specific model.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09602-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437139/";7/1/2021;National Incident-Based Reporting System;0.9558

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was capable to infect domestic and captive mammals like cats, tigers and minks. Due to genetic similarities, concern about the infection of Non-Human Primates (NHPs) and the establishment of a sylvatic cycle has grown in the Americas. In this study, neotropical primates (NP) were sampled in different areas from Brazil to investigate whether they were infected by SARS-CoV-2. A total of 89 samples from 51 NP of four species were examined. No positive samples were detected via RT-qPCR, regardless of the NHP species, tissue or habitat tested. This work provides the first report on the lack of evidence of circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in NP.

In late 2019, an unnamed genetic relative, later named SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), erupted in the highly populous neighborhoods of Wuhan, China. Unchecked, COVID-19 spread rapidly among interconnected communities and related households before containment measures could be enacted. At present, the mortality rate of COVID-19 infection worldwide is 6.6%. In order to mitigate the number of infections, restrictions or recommendations on the number of people that can gather in a given area have been employed by governments worldwide. For governments to confidently lift these restrictions as well as counter a potential secondary wave of infections, alternative medications and diagnostic strategies against COVID-19 are urgently required.

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can stimulate a pronounced immune response in the host, which embodies in the decrease of lymphocytes and aberrant increase of cytokines in COVID‐19 patients. SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA and proteins interact with various pattern recognition receptors that switch on antiviral immune responses to regulate viral replication and spreading within the host in vivo. However, overactive and impaired immune responses also cause immune damage and subsequent tissue inflammation. This article focuses on the dual roles of immune system during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, providing a theoretical basic for identifying therapeutic targets in a situation with an unfavorable immune reaction.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/sji.12895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445403/";23/5/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9249

Acute fatigue develops frequently after physical exercise or after alcohol hangover, whereas microbial infections such as influenza or COVID-19 and chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis are often associated with chronic fatigue. Oxidative stress and a resulting disturbance of mitochondrial function are likely to be common denominators for many forms of fatigue, and antioxidant treatments have been shown to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of fatigue. In this study, we review the role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in fatigue and the antioxidant effects of the intake of molecular hydrogen.

Simulating the dynamics of realistically complex models of infectious disease is conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. This results in a heavy reliance on customized software and, correspondingly, lower reproducibility across disease modeling studies. 2. SPARSEMOD stands for SPAtial Resolution-SEnsitive Models of Outbreak Dynamics. The goal of our project, encapsulated by the SPARSEMODr R package, is to offer a framework for rapidly simulating the dynamics of stochastic and spatially-explicit models of infectious disease for use in pedagogical and applied contexts. 3. We outline the universal functions of our package that allow for user-customization while demonstrating the common work flow. 4. SPARSEMODr offers an extendable framework that should allow the open-source community of disease modelers to add new model types and functionalities in future releases.;http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.13.21256216v1?rss=1;18/5/2021;SPAtial Resolution-SEnsitive Models of Outbreak Dynamics;0.9128

Driven by concerns for safety, equity and financial pressures, virtual interviewing will require a thoughtful approach to achieve the desired goals of recruitment. Drawing on the fields of communication and human resources management, we examine the potential effects of web-based interviews on communication through the lens of several communication theories: media richness, media naturalness and signaling. We then review the literature on virtual interviews in GME training programs.

To accomplish this feat, ACS must bind CoA and interact with two other proteins that contribute the CO and CH3+, respectively: CO dehydrogenase (CODH) and corrinoid Fe-S protein (CFeSP). Previous structural data show that, in the model acetogen Moorella thermoacetica, domain 1 of ACS binds to CODH such that a 70-Å-long internal channel is created that allows CO to travel from CODH to the A-cluster. The A-cluster is largely buried and is inaccessible to CFeSP for methylation. Here we use electron microscopy to capture multiple snapshots of ACS that reveal previously uncharacterized domain motion, forming extended and hyperextended structural states. In these structural states, the A-cluster is accessible for methylation by CFeSP.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2020.08.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937101/";14/9/2020;CO dehydrogenase;0.9764

As a response plan, numerous governments are turning toward economic mechanisms to support both local and national economies. While those are hailed, as the number for unemployment rises, economic stimulus packages are in essence a short-term solution but with the potential to impact on the long-term socioeconomic fabric. In this respect, if not carefully crafted, those emergency economic packages can bailout heavy and polluting industries, hence posing a long-term problem for the actualization of sustainability agendas and commitments.

Previous research has suggested that an overactivation of the host inflammatory response is at least partly involved in mediating the kidney damage observed in P. falciparum patients with AKI, however the exact pathophysiology of AKI in severe malaria remains unknown. The purpose of this mini-review is to describe how different aspects of malaria pathology, including parasite sequestration, microvascular obstruction and extensive intravascular hemolysis, may interact with each other and contribute to the development of AKI in severe malaria, by amplifying the damaging effects of the host inflammatory response.

The addition of rapid smartphone-based exposure notification offers few benefits over conventional manual tracing alone unless uptake of the digital system is near-universal. However, as long as exposure events can be detected by nearly all smartphones, the combination of manual and digital with bidirectional tracing more than doubles the probability of controlling outbreaks across three epidemiological scenarios.

It also reveals that humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 have infected mink populations in the Netherlands, Denmark, United States, and Canada. In these animals, a small set of mutations often in combination, in the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) has apparently transferred back into humans. The viral genomic mutations in minks observed in the Netherlands and Denmark show the potential for new mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD to be introduced into humans by zoonotic transfer.

Research shows that the SARS-CoV-2 can be clustered with the Bat SARS-like coronavirus. Bats possess an additional, innate ability for antiviral defense, and, on the other hand, the potential to go hand-in-hand with the virus to generate variability. Besides the high potential of the novel coronavirus in compromising the respiratory system, its rapid transmission and ability to engage many hosts in severe forms of infections or immunopathological complications make it a tough opponent for the immune system. The interactions between SARS-CoV2 and the host immune system result in unleashing tremendous amounts of cytokines, and these cytokines make a storm that would determine the outcome (recovery or death) of the lungs of the patient.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.05.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440920307499?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532524/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0188440920307499";30/5/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9032

Our estimates of the risk for death in Wuhan reached values as high as 12% in the epicenter of the epidemic and ≈1% in other, more mildly affected areas. The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a breakdown of the healthcare system, indicating that enhanced public health interventions, including social distancing and movement restrictions, should be implemented to bring the COVID-19 epidemic under control.;"https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2606.200233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32168464/";5/6/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9881

Everything indicates that a similar phenomenon also occurs in children with COVID-19. Anticoagulant treatment has become one of the therapeutic foundations for this infection; however, its implementation in children can be difficult since, until recently, it was not considered in the pediatric population. Evidence regarding the use of anticoagulants in COVID-19 is rapidly generated, changes constantly, it is often difficult to interpret, and can be contradictory.

876;In-person schooling and COVID-19 transmission in Canada's three largest cities;10.1101/2021.03.21.21254064;In North America and Europe, the Fall 2020 school term has coincided with the beginning of the second wave of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, sparking a heated debate about the role of in-person schooling for community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This issue has immediate policy relevance for deciding how to operate schools safely as the pandemic unfolds, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating, and immunization coverage remains low. We contribute to this debate by presenting data on trends in COVID-19 weekly incidence among school-aged children 0-19 years old vis-a-vis other age groups during Fall 2020 in Canada's three largest cities: Montreal, Toronto and Calgary. We interpret these trends in light of the different back-to-school policies and other public health measures implemented in the three cities over the observation period.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.21.21254064; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254064v1?rss=1";23/3/2021;coronavirus;0.9859

We conducted a retrospective study with the collected data of 171 ER patients. ER patient classification for cardiac and infection causes was evaluated with clinical data and chest X-ray image data. We show that a deep-learning model trained with an external image data set can be used to extract image features and improve the classification accuracy of a data set that does not contain enough image data to train a deep-learning model. An analysis of clinical feature importance was performed to identify the most important clinical features for ER patient classification.

879;Automatic Semantic Description Extraction from Social Big Data for Emergency Management;10.1007/s11518-019-5453-5;Emergency events are unexpected and dangerous situations which the authorities must manage and respond to as quickly as possible. The main objectives of emergency management are to provide human safety and security, and Social Big Data (SBD) offers an important information source, created directly from eyewitness reports, to assist with these issues. However, the manual extraction of hidden meaning from SBD is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, which are major drawbacks for a process that needs accurate information to be produced in real-time. The solution is an automatic approach to knowledge discovery, and we propose a semantic description technique based on the use of triple store indexing for named entity recognition and relation extraction. Our technique can discover hidden SBD information more effectively than traditional approaches, and can be used for intelligent emergency management.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282698/;9/6/2020;Social Big Data;0.9424

One critique of COVID-19 HCTs is their distinct paucity of information on crucial population groups. For safety reasons, these HCTs will exclude candidate participants of advanced age or with comorbidities that worsen COVID-19, yet a vaccine should (perhaps especially) protect such populations. We turn this cliché on its head. The truth is that either an HCT or a field trial has intrinsic generalisability limitations, that an HCT can expedite protection of high-risk participants even without challenging them with the virus, and that an important route to obtaining results generalisable to high-risk groups under either strategy is facilitated by HCTs.;"https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-107109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099541/";7/6/2021;human challenge trials;0.9107

892;The role of absolute humidity on transmission rates of the COVID-19 outbreak;10.1101/2020.02.12.20022467;A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has caused over 40,000 cases worldwide to date. Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022467;17/2/2020;coronavirus;0.9584

In this study, the N proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were found to bind to MASP-2, the key serine protease in the lectin pathway of complement activation, resulting in aberrant complement activation and aggravated inflammatory lung injury. Either blocking the N protein:MASP-2 interaction or suppressing complement activation can significantly alleviate N protein-induced complement hyper-activation and lung injury in vitro and in vivo. Complement hyper-activation was also observed in COVID-19 patients, and a promising suppressive effect was observed when the deteriorating patients were treated with anti-C5a monoclonal antibody.

The results from the structural equation modeling (SEM) reveal that public service experience positively moderates the relationship between effort expectancy and behavioral intention to adopt digital government innovations. Unlike previous studies which found that experience positively moderates the relationship between effort expectancy and behavioral intention of less experienced ICT users, this study finds that the longer the time spent in the public service, the higher the perception of government employees regarding the ease of use (effort expectancy) of the digital innovation. The findings might be attributable to the lack of training for government staff.

Here we examine a case of a middle-aged women presenting with a chief report of shortness of breath, who subsequently developed muscle weakness. Her clinical course was complicated by respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension likely due to the underlying pathology of signal recognition particle-positive necrotising myopathy. After further evaluation, her shortness of breath was thought to be secondary to muscle pathology rather than cardiopulmonary pathology. She was transferred to our institution for workup by rheumatology. At the time of admission, 6 months after initial presentation, her weakness progressed, so that she was unable to lift her arms and legs against gravity.

903;Massive Multiplexing Can Deliver a $1 Test for COVID-19;10.1101/2020.05.05.079400;The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, SARS-CoV-2 (hereafter COVID-19), rapidly achieved global pandemic status, provoking large-scale screening programs in many nations. Their activation makes it imperative to identify methods that can deliver a diagnostic result at low cost. This paper describes an approach which employs sequence variation in the gene coding for its envelope protein as the basis for a scalable, inexpensive test for COVID-19. It achieves this by coupling a simple RNA extraction protocol with low-volume RT-PCR, followed by E-Gel screening and sequencing on high-throughput platforms to analyze 10,000 samples in a run. Slight modifications to the protocol could support screening programs for other known viruses and for viral discovery. Just as the $1,000 genome is transforming medicine, a $1 diagnostic test for viral and bacterial pathogens would represent a major advance for public health.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.079400;8/5/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.974

927;Changing the narrative on fisheries subsidies reform: Enabling transitions to achieve SDG 14.6 and beyond;10.1016/j.marpol.2020.103970;The World Trade Organization (WTO) is in the final stages of negotiating an agreement to prohibit harmful fisheries subsidies, thereby achieving UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.6. An effective agreement should be viewed as an opportunity for nations to proactively transition towards sustainable and equitable fisheries and pave the path for other SDGs. Supporting fishers does not require harmful subsidies, and we provide evidence-based options for reform that highlight equity needs while reducing environmental harm. Subsidy reforms need clear goals, co-design, transparency, and fair implementation. An agreement on SDG 14.6 could be a turning point for the oceans and for the well-being of those that depend on the oceans for livelihoods and nutrition. Responsible seafood production will require international cooperation not only at WTO, but among governments, fisher organizations, civil society, and the wider public.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.103970; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0308597X20302529; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X20302529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287946/";8/4/2020;UN Sustainable Development Goal;0.9244

To investigate these relationships, we conducted indirect functional assessments of aggressive behavior exhibited by 41 adolescent boys with FXS and 59 age and symptom-matched controls with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) and compared the data between groups. Results showed that boys with FXS were more likely to exhibit specific forms of aggressive behavior (i.e., scratching others and biting others) compared to controls, but the sources of reinforcement identified for aggression were similar across groups. Boys with FXS who were prescribed psychotropic medications were more likely to be older and to exhibit more forms of aggression.

We report successful removal of an extremely rare foreign body between a tracheal tube and the trachea in patients under tracheal intubation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old male received total aortic arch replacement and postoperative mechanical ventilation. An airway foreign body was detected just below the glottis, outside the tracheal tube during mechanical ventilation after surgery in the intensive care unit. Before the removal procedure, we planned multiple strategies to cope with unexpected airway and breathing troubles. As a result, the foreign body was successfully removed orally by using a bronchial fiber, without extubation of the tracheal tube, under general anesthesia with dexmedetomidine and ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: We reported the successful removal of a foreign body in the subglottic airway of a patient under tracheal intubation.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7533046/;4/10/2020;Removal of an airway foreign body;0.9201

LTCF outbreaks could continue occurring during vaccine rollout due to incomplete population coverage, and the effect of vaccines on viral transmission are currently unknown. Declining adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against within-facility transmission could therefore limit the effectiveness of vaccination. We built a stochastic model to simulate outbreaks in LTCF populations with differing vaccination coverage and NPI adherence to evaluate their interacting effects. Vaccination combined with strong NPI adherence produced the least morbidity and mortality. Healthcare worker vaccination improved outcomes in unvaccinated LTCF residents but was less impactful with declining NPI adherence. To prevent further illness and deaths, there is a continued need for NPIs in LTCFs during vaccine rollout.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249339v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.21249339";6/1/2021;Long-term care facilities;0.9431

Epitopes for RBD-targeting nAbs overlap one another substantially and can give rise to escape mutants with ACE2 affinities comparable to wild type that still infect cells in vitro. Based on this demonstrated mutational tolerance of the RBD, we used evolutionary modeling to predict the frequency of immune escape before and after the widespread presence of nAbs raised by vaccines, administered as prophylactics, or produced through natural immunity. Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and likewise resistance to single or double antibody combinations will develop quickly under positive selection.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.17.20233726v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.17.20233726";20/11/2020;spike protein receptor-binding domain;0.9137

We performed a comprehensive measurement and modeling analysis of the aerosol chemistry and physics at multiple sites in China (mainly in Shanghai) before, during, and after NYH‐19 and NYH‐20. Much higher secondary aerosol fraction in PM(2.5) were observed during NYH‐20 (73%) than during NYH‐19 (59%). During NYH‐20, PM(2.5) levels correlated significantly with the oxidation ratio of nitrogen (r (2) = 0.77, p < 0.01), and aged particles from northern China were found to impede atmospheric new particle formation and growth in Shanghai.

Herein, we employed a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) murine model of sepsis, to evaluate the effects of sepsis-induced EBD in the expression of the never in mitosis A (NIMA)-related kinases (NEKs). Members of that family of kinases regulate the activity and expression of the tumor suppressor P53, previously shown to modulate the actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Our results introduce the induction of NEK2, NEK3, NEK4, NEK7, and NEK9 in a CLP model of sepsis. Hence, we suggest that NEKs are involved in inflammatory processes and are holding the potential to serve as novel therapeutic targets for pathologies related to EBD, including ARDS and sepsis.

Within a short period of time, the infectious disease has spread far and wide. This study focuses on the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases in China---the original epicenter of the outbreak. We show that the upper tail of COVID-19 cases in Chinese cities is well described by a power law distribution, with exponent less than one, and that a random proportionate growth model predicated by Gibrat's law is a plausible explanation for the emergence of the observed power law behavior. This finding is significant because it implies that COVID-19 cases in China is heavy-tailed and disperse, that a few cities account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases, and that the distribution has no finite mean or variance.

The role of domestic livestock and the risk associated for humans in close contact remains unknown for many production animals. Determination of the susceptibility of pigs to SARS-CoV-2 is critical towards a One Health approach to manage the potential risk of zoonotic transmission. Here, pigs undergoing experimental inoculation are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 at low levels. Viral RNA was detected in group oral fluids and nasal wash from at least two animals while live virus was isolated from a pig. Further, antibodies could be detected in two animals at 11 and 13 days post infection, while oral fluid samples at 6 days post inoculation indicated the presence of secreted antibodies. These data highlight the need for additional livestock assessment to better determine the potential role domestic animals may contribute towards the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.10.288548;10/9/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9349

Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-pharmacological tool that could be associated with pharmacological treatments to improve the central nervous system function and decrease the exacerbation of the immune system response. tDCS targeting pain and fatigue-related areas could provide an increase in neuroplasticity and enhancements in physical functions.

953;Save the Economy, Liberty, and Yourself: Christian Nationalism and Americans’ Views on Government COVID-19 Restrictions;10.1093/socrel/sraa047;During the COVID-19 pandemic, state and local governments implemented lockdown restrictions that were tremendously polarizing. Those on the cultural and political left supported restrictions hoping to protect the vulnerable, while those on the cultural and political right challenged restrictions citing threats to the economy and liberty. We theorize that libertarian and authoritarian impulses within Christian nationalism undergirded much of the resistance to government restrictions. Analyzing national panel data collected before and during the pandemic, we find Christian nationalism is either the first or second strongest predictor that Americans prioritize the economy and liberty and deprioritize the vulnerable when asked about government restrictions. Religiosity works in the opposite direction, however. Findings underscore the centrality of Christian nationalism as an ideological driver of far-right discourse shaping COVID-19 responses.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798614/;29/12/2020;Religiosity;0.9149

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Though the target organ for the virus is primarily the lungs, with the recent understanding of the pathobiology of this disease and the immune dysregulation associated with it, it is now clear that COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems. Several drugs and therapies have been tried or repurposed to combat the wrath posed by this disease. On October 22, 2020, the USA Food and Drug Administration approved remdesivir for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older). Several of the drugs being tried against COVID-19 have hepatotoxicity as their potential side effect.

This has led to a significant impact on the lives and economy in China and other countries. Here we develop a discrete-time stochastic epidemic model with binomial distributions to study the transmission of the disease. Model parameters are estimated on the basis of fitting to newly reported data from January 11 to February 13, 2020 in China. The estimates of the contact rate and the effective reproductive number support the efficiency of the control measures that have been implemented so far. Simulations show the newly confirmed cases will continue to decline and the total confirmed cases will reach the peak around the end of February of 2020 under the current control measures. The impact of the timing of returning to work is also evaluated on the disease transmission given different strength of protection and control measures.;"https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987496/";16/3/2020;Coronavirus;0.9514

The key advantage of these data is that they allow us to examine infection rates for people with particular characteristics. We study how reported symptoms vary in the population and relate reported symptoms to a positive Covid-19 test in the small sample in the survey who were tested. Combining these probabilities we find that the chances of infection increase with a persons education level, are lower and declining with age among those aged over 55, and were higher in the West Midlands and London and lower in the North East than in the rest of the country, and tended to increase with regional population density. There is also evidence that the infection rate was lower among those of a Caribbean origin.

To gain entry, the virus uses its spike protein to bind to host hACE-2 receptors on the host cell surface and mediate fusion between viral and cell membranes. As initial steps leading to virus entry involves significant changes in protein conformation as well as in the electrostatic environment in the vicinity of the spike-hACE-2 complex, we explored the sensitivity of the interaction to changes in ionic strength through computational simulations and surface plasmon resonance. We identified two regions in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), E1 and E2, which interact differently with hACE-2. At high salt concentration, E2-mediated interactions are weakened but are compensated by strengthening E1-mediated hydrophobic interactions. These results provide a detailed molecular understanding of spike RBD/hACE-2 complex formation and stability under a wide range of ionic strengths.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.267351;26/8/2020;receptor-binding domain;0.9682

Triage means not only ranking in terms of importance (prioritisation) but also allocation of limited medical resources. Survival, post epidemic-quality of life, and consumption of medical resources required to achieve the set goal are crucial for making triage decisions. The pandemic triage decisions should be based on a protocol, considering the need for medical measures and therapy benefits. The first step is to consider the exclusion criteria and the risk of death. The next step is sequential clinical assessment, repeatable at defined intervals. It seems that the preferable solution is to triage all the patients and give priority to those who would benefit more.

978;A rough set based algorithm for updating the modes in categorical clustering;10.1007/s13042-021-01293-w;The categorical clustering problem has attracted much attention especially in the last decades since many real world applications produce categorical data. The k-mode algorithm, proposed since 1998, and its multiple variants were widely used in this context. However, they suffer from a great limitation related to the update of the modes in each iteration. The mode in the last step of these algorithms is randomly selected although it is possible to identify many candidate ones. In this paper, a rough density mode selection method is proposed to identify the adequate modes among a list of candidate ones in each iteration of the k-modes. The proposed method, called Density Rough k-Modes (DRk-M) was experimented using real world datasets extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and a set of collected Tweets. The DRk-M was also compared to many states of the art clustering methods and has shown great efficiency.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13042-021-01293-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33815625/";27/3/2021;Global Terrorism Database;0.9235
979;IS ALBUMIN PREDICTOR OF MORTALITY IN COVID-19 ?;10.1089/ars.2020.8142;Coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) is a pandemic associated with a high risk of mortality. Human serum albumin (HSA) is an acute phase reactant with antioxidant property, however its behavior and impact on survival in Covid-19 patients has never been studied so far. Among 319 Covid-19 patients followed-up for a median of 19 days, 64 died. Compared to survivors, non-survivors had more prevalence of Intensive care unit (ICU) admission, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, elevated levels of D-dimer, hs-CRP and troponins and lower values of albumin. At the Cox regression analysis, albumin (HR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.23-0.63, p<0.001) and age (HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.06, p=0.001) were independently associated with mortality, irrespective of adjustment for sex, ICU admission, heart failure, COPD and hs-CRP levels. Our observation leads to the hypothesis that HSA analysis may be used to identify patients at higher risk of death in Covid-19 patients.;"https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2020.8142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32524832/";11/6/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.973
980;Axiomatic Analysis of Contact Recommendation Methods in Social Networks: An IR Perspective;10.1007/978-3-030-45439-5_12;Contact recommendation is an important functionality in many social network scenarios including Twitter and Facebook, since they can help grow the social networks of users by suggesting, to a given user, people they might wish to follow. Recently, it has been shown that classical information retrieval (IR) weighting models – such as BM25 – can be adapted to effectively recommend new social contacts to a given user. However, the exact properties that make such adapted contact recommendation models effective at the task are as yet unknown. In this paper, inspired by new advances in the axiomatic theory of IR, we study the existing IR axioms for the contact recommendation task. Our theoretical analysis and empirical findings show that while the classical axioms related to term frequencies and term discrimination seem to have a positive impact on the recommendation effectiveness, those related to length normalization tend to be not desirable for the task.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148256/;17/3/2020;Contact recommendation;0.9157

982;Mitigation of head and neck cancer service disruption during COVID‐19 in Hong Kong through telehealth and multi‐institutional collaboration;10.1002/hed.26226;The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic has been spreading worldwide at an alarming rate. Health‐care workers have been confronted with the challenge of not only treating patients with the virus, but also managing the disruption of health‐care services caused by COVID‐19. In anticipation of outbreak, clinic sessions and operation theater lists have been actively cut back since February 2020 to reduce hospital admissions and clinic attendances. This has severely disrupted health‐care services, leading to accumulating clinic caseload and substantial delays for operations. The head and neck cancer service has been faced with the difficult task of managing the balance between infection risk to health‐care providers and the risk of disease progression from prolonged waiting times. We share our experience in Hong Kong on the mitigation of head and neck cancer service disruption through telehealth and multi‐institution collaboration.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32357277/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26226";7/5/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9671

We found that about 3% of patients with life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia were ill because of inborn errors of genes controlling type I interferon (IFN)-dependent immunity (which controls influenza virus), and at least 10% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia had neutralizing auto-Abs against some of the 17 individual type I IFNs. These findings indicate that impaired type I IFN immunity underlies life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in at least 13% of patients.

In China, patients with two negative respiratory viral RNA tests taken at least one day apart can be discharged with no further quarantine required. Currently, PCR testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in fecal sample is not routinely performed. METHODS We present a patient with COVID-19, whose respiratory swabs became negative but fecal sample remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS Stool sample collected on 27th of February was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 24 days after the first negative respiratory swab.

We explore how the successful handling of COVID‐19 shaped South Korean citizens' perception of their country. Empirically, we compare data from surveys conducted in August 2019 and April 2020. Using regression on matched samples, we find a significant increase in general national pride. More importantly, we find an increase in positive assessments of their country in domains directly related to the COVID‐19 response (civic awareness and international leadership) but not in domains less directly related to the pandemic. We also find that while Koreans take pride in their collective response to the crisis, their disenchantment with the political class has grown. The implication is that citizens offer a remarkably nuanced understanding of how the COVID‐19 response reflected the strengths of the Korean society, as opposed to the Korean political system.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242652/;6/6/2021;civic awareness and international leadership;0.9571

Our retrospective study aimed to report the prevalence of PE in patients with COVID-19 and severe respiratory failure (SRF) treated with intermediate- to full-dose enoxaparin. We analyzed data from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and SRF admitted to our Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) from February 27 to April 20, 2020. All patients received at least intermediate-dose enoxaparin (40 mg twice daily). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was used to detect PE. Ninety-two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and SRF were admitted to our RICU. Twenty-two patients underwent CTPA (24 %), 11 of whom had PEs (12%).

Society must mitigate this impact by recognizing that COVID-19 can trigger people's fears of exacerbating an existing mental illness. A survey about COVID-19 for people with mental illness was developed. METHODS Two hundred fourteen people responded to the survey, of whom 193 self-identified as living with a mental illness. RESULTS Almost all participants living with a mental illness (98%) said they had at least one major concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and 62% said they had at least three major concerns. CONCLUSIONS People living with a mental illness are very concerned about disruption of services, running out of medication, and social isolation during this pandemic.

These cases with findings overlapping with cancer pose a significant dilemma for diagnostic purposes, follow-up, and management leading to possible treatment delays, unnecessary repeat imaging and sampling, and patient anxiety. These cases can largely be avoided by optimal coordination between vaccination and planned imaging as well as preemptive selection of vaccine administration site.

Although the diagnosis of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is microbiological, imaging techniques play an important role in supporting the diagnosis, grading the severity of disease, guiding treatment, detecting complications, and evaluating the response to treatment. The lungs are the main organ involved, and chest X-rays, whether obtained in conventional X-ray suites or with portable units, are the first-line imaging test because they are widely available and economical. Chest CT is more sensitive than plain chest X-rays, and CT studies make it possible to identify complications in addition to pulmonary involvement, as well as to suggestive alternative diagnoses.

But whether and how our motor behavior is affected during body sharing remains unclear. Here we examined this issue in arm reaching performed by a shared avatar, whose movement was generated by averaging the movements of two participants. We observed that participants exhibited improved reaction times with a shared avatar than alone. Moreover, the reach trajectory of the shared avatar was straighter than that of either participant and correlated with their subjective embodiment of the avatar. Finally, the jerk of the avatar's hand was less than either participant's own hand, both when they reached alone and in the shared body. Movement straightness and hand jerk are well known characteristics of human reach behavior, and our results suggest that during body sharing, humans prioritize these movement characteristics of the shared body over their own.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33376966/";10/11/2020;Cyber space;0.9289

1003;The impact of COVID-19: Considerations for future dental conferences.;10.1002/jdd.12330;The onset of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) impacted all facets of global communities. As such, dental organizations must reconsider the traditional format of conferences in order to abide by public health guidelines. Such an adjustment is required in an effort to limit the footprint and ensure the safety of its participants. This article aims to provide guidance to reformat a traditional conference to a virtual platform. Recommendations are made pertaining to the structure of organizational committees, the intricacies of digital platforms, any associated costs, and adjustments to advertising and sponsorships. The authors also provide direction regarding changes in scheduling, and suggestions in order to replicate the social aspect of academic conferences. Careful consideration of the existing format can help design an efficient virtual platform that will continue to yield professional growth and drive the frontier of research in dentistry during this pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32715466/";27/7/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9279
1004;Personal resources and personal demands for work engagement: Evidence from employees in the service industry;10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102600;Conventional studies have widely demonstrated that individuals’ engagement at work depends on their personal resources, which are affected by environmental influences, especially those derived from the workplace and home domains. In this study, we examine whether a change in work engagement may be based on individuals’ decisions in managing their personal resources. We use the conservation of resources (COR) theory to explain how personal resources and personal demands at home can influence work engagement through personal resources and personal demands at work. We conducted a daily diary study involving a group of 97 Chinese employees (N = 97) from a range of different service settings for 2 consecutive weeks (N = 1358) and evaluated their daily work engagement using manager ratings. The findings support the hypothesized mediating effects of personal resources and personal demands at work on personal resources and personal demands at home and work engagement.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834349/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431920301523; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102600; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278431920301523";30/6/2020;conservation of resources;0.9899
1005;Ireland’s Policy Response to Climate Change: An Historical Overview;10.1007/978-3-030-47587-1_3;This chapter provides an overview of Ireland’s policy response to climate change. It traces the evolution of climate policy during four distinct historical phases. The first of these was the era of the so-called Celtic Tiger, which saw a rapid rise in emissions. The second was characterised by profound crisis of economy and polity, during which attention was diverted from climate policy but with a significant fall in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The third phase was the economic recovery, which in many ways was as unexpected in its speed and extent as the crash. During this period, Ireland’s emissions rebounded strongly, illustrating that Ireland’s emissions remain stubbornly coupled to economic growth. Fourth and finally, the chapter examines Irish climate policy since 2017, asking whether Ireland has left its laggard status behind. The chapter concludes with a reflection on the broader context that has shaped Ireland’s policy response to climate change.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991542/;2/7/2020;greenhouse gas;0.9255
1006;A discourse-theoretic approach to story recall in aging and mild cognitive impairment.;10.1080/13825585.2020.1821865;Recall of story materials is a primary way to assess episodic memory. However, the standard scoring method may not be maximally sensitive to cognitive decline. We developed a set of 24 stories, and younger and older adults heard these stories and recalled them immediately and after a delay (Study 1). Twelve of these stories were then selected, and older adults and people with MCI completed immediate and delayed recall of these stories (Study 2). Responses were classified as veridical, gist, or distorted, and were scored by number of units and number of propositions recalled. Younger adults had higher veridical recall than older adults, and proposition-based scoring revealed higher gist recall in older than younger adults. Gist and distortion recall increased over time in older adults, but decreased in MCI. Using proposition-based scoring and distinguishing between veridical and gist responses may discriminate better between healthy older adults and people with MCI.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/13825585.2020.1821865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985351/";27/9/2020;Recall of story materials;0.9045

All patients used anti‐coronavirus‐19 (COVID‐19) face mask for many hours per day. According to the clinical point of view, the worsening was characterized by increased erythema and desquamation as well as itching worsened. In the last few weeks, some articles have been published on cases of dermatitis of the face associated with the use of anti‐COVID‐19 masks. Some authors hypothesized that this condition is due to high temperature of the face covered by the mask, that induces an increased sebum excretion rate. In our patients with SD, it is possible that high temperature of the face induces abnormalities of microbiota (proliferation of Malassezia spp.?) and permeability of skin barrier, and increases sweating with irritant action and worsening of itching.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790897/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.13669";13/8/2020;anti‐coronavirus‐19;0.9363

At present, there are no early prognostic biomarkers that can be used in clinical practice to predict the development of BPD. In this review, we critically appraise evidence regarding the use of serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) levels as a biomarker for BPD in neonates. Furthermore, we summarize studies assessing the feasibility of urinary NTproBNP levels as a non-invasive method to predict BPD in preterm infants. Multiple studies reported a strong association between NTproBNP serum levels and the onset of BPD. For urinary NTproBNP there is scarce evidence showing an association with BPD. Given the promising data obtained by preliminary studies, further assessment of this biomarker in both serum and urine is needed.

Considering that SARS-CoV-2 cannot tolerate temperatures above 70 °C, here we designed and fabricated efficient air disinfection systems based on heated nickel (Ni) foam to catch and kill SARS-CoV-2. Virus test results revealed that 99.8% of the aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 was caught and killed by a single pass through a Ni-foam-based filter when heated up to 200 °C. Additionally, the same filter was also used to catch and kill 99.9% of Bacillus anthracis, an airborne spore.

The study found that whether financial managers developed coping strategies depends on their assessment of potential business revenue losses. There are two transmission paths: the direct effect refers to the risk perception directly caused by COVID-19, while the indirect effect refers to managers’ fear that they will not make timely adjustments or will make judgment errors, resulting in the loss of competitive advantage. It is worth noting that the indirect effect exceeds the direct effect, which indicates that financial managers are more rational than ordinary people in dealing with COVID-19, that they are relatively more concerned about competitor changes, and that they may even view COVID-19 as an important opportunity to obtain a better competitive position.;"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.556139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33192811/";27/10/2020;coronavirus;0.9267

Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we have demonstrated the allosteric crosstalk within the RBD in the apo‐ and the ACE2 receptor‐bound states, revealing the contribution of the dynamics‐based correlated motions and the electrostatic energy perturbations to this crosstalk. While allostery, based on correlated motions, dominates inherent distal communication in the apo‐RBD, the electrostatic energy perturbations determine favorable pairwise crosstalk within the RBD residues upon binding to ACE2. Interestingly, the allosteric path is composed of residues which are evolutionarily conserved within closely related coronaviruses, pointing toward the biological relevance of the communication and its potential as a target for drug development.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449359/; https://doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.14038";31/1/2021;receptor‐binding domain;0.9098

Understanding the changes in gut microbiome during infections including virus may help to use novel strategies in the therapeutic interventions. METHODS: We have reviewed recent reports on role of gut microbiome in lung infections and its possible importance in COVID-19. RESULTS: Most of the studies provide an insight into the possible role of gut microbes during lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, and other respiratory problems such as allergy and asthma. However, clinical evidence underlying gut-lung crosstalk during respiratory viral infections is limited. CONCLUSION: This review provides an overview of the role of the gut microbiome during respiratory viral infections mainly focused on COVID-19 and possible evidence for its crosstalk targeting as new therapeutics.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7685301/;24/11/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9768
1026;Asymmetric cell division shapes naive and virtual memory T-cell immunity during ageing.;10.1038/s41467-021-22954-y;Efficient immune responses rely on heterogeneity, which in CD8+ T cells, amongst other mechanisms, is achieved by asymmetric cell division (ACD). Here we find that ageing, known to negatively impact immune responses, impairs ACD in murine CD8+ T cells, and that this phenotype can be rescued by transient mTOR inhibition. Increased ACD rates in mitotic cells from aged mice restore the expansion and memory potential of their cellular progenies. Further characterization of the composition of CD8+ T cells reveals that virtual memory cells (TVM cells), which accumulate during ageing, have a unique proliferation and metabolic profile, and retain their ability to divide asymmetrically, which correlates with increased memory potential. The opposite is observed for naive CD8+ T cells from aged mice. Our data provide evidence on how ACD modulation contributes to long-term survival and function of T cells during ageing, offering new insights into how the immune system adapts to ageing.;"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22954-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976157/";11/5/2021;asymmetric cell division;0.9842
1027;Adaptive cyclic exit strategies from lockdown to suppress COVID-19 and allow economic activity;10.1101/2020.04.04.20053579;Many countries have applied lockdown that helped suppress COVID-19, but with devastating economic consequences. Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity. We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or similar variants, can prevent resurgence of the epidemic while providing part-time employment. The cycle pushes the reproduction number R below one by reduced exposure time and by exploiting the virus latent period: those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days. The number of work days can be adapted in response to observations.

1028;Do we really need guidelines for HRA during COVID‐19 pandemic? ‐ Response;10.1111/codi.15203;Mistrangelo et al raise a number of issues in connection with the International Anal Neoplasia Society guidelines for the practice of High Resolution Anoscopy (HRA) in the era of COVID‐19. The authors suggest that the guidelines advocate “mandatory” HRA for “screening”. On the contrary, the guidelines clearly define risk prioritisation, in terms of both potential COVID‐19 exposure and the dangers associated with delayed diagnosis of anal cancers. Centres without access to high quality HRA services may have to rely on digital anal rectal examination to eventually diagnose large anal cancers. HRA has the ability to accurately identify early anal cancers and worrisome pre‐cancerous lesions, and thus to facilitate early intervention. It therefore has the capacity to substantially improve survival and quality of life of patients. This remains true in the era of COVID‐19, and will be of increasing importance as the epidemic continues and services remain disrupted.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32564503/; https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15203";21/6/2020;High Resolution Anoscopy;0.9063

PCR tests are currently the gold standard for diagnosis of the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and serology tests are used to detect seroconversion in infected patients. However, there is a lack of quantitative and ultra-sensitive viral antigen tests for COVID-19. Here we show that Single Molecule Array (Simoa) assays can quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1 subunit, and nucleocapsid antigens in the plasma of COVID-19 patients. Combined with Simoa anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, we show correlation between production of antibodies and clearance of viral antigens from serial plasma samples from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of viral antigens in blood correlates with disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in the blood could be a marker for severe COVID-19 cases.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.20156372; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.20156372v1?rss=1";26/7/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9521

In favor of BTKi continuation, BTK plays an active role in macrophage polarization. By modulating key transcription factors, BTK may regulate macrophage polarization downstream of classic M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli and mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with COVID19. In favor of BTKi discontinuation, we note a potentially increased risk of secondary infections or impaired humoral immunity. We hypothesize that the potential benefit of blunting a hyper-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 through attenuation of M1 polarization outweighs the potential risk of impaired humoral immunity, not to mention the risk of rapid progression of B-cell malignancy following BTKi interruption. Based on this, we suggest continuing BTKi in patients with COVID19.;"https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-20-1427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345646/";28/4/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.959

In this article, we highlight lessons learned from previous efforts to scale up vaccine distribution and offer considerations for policymakers and key stakeholders to use for successful COVID-19 vaccination rollout in Africa. These considerations range from improving weak infrastructure for managing data and identifying adverse events after immunization to considering financing options for overcoming the logistical challenges of vaccination campaigns and generating demand for vaccine uptake. In addition, providing COVID-19 vaccination can be used to promote the adoption of universal healthcare, especially in sub-Saharan Africa countries.;"https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2708.203870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138694/";17/6/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9613
1053;Impact of COVID-19 on medical students in the United Kingdom.;10.18683/germs.2020.1210;Medical student training in the United Kingdom has undoubtedly been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most notably, there have been disruptions to teaching, cancellation of exams and clinical electives and the abandonment of research projects. In response, medical education has been reshaped to facilitate the continuation of studies, such as the online deliverance of course material, digital examinations and implementing welfare and financial support systems. There has also been a surge in student volunteers, often playing critical roles in primary and secondary care to support National Health Service (NHS) staff working on the frontlines. This opinion piece will aim to address the effects of COVID-19 on medical students and their training, and further evaluate how well medical schools responded to the challenges presented by the pandemic. This should highlight aspects requiring improvement and will allow medical schools to be better prepared to tackle similar dilemmas in the future.;"https://doi.org/10.18683/germs.2020.1210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134202/";1/9/2020;Medical student training;0.9373
1054;Litigating the Crisis: Towards a Rebalancing of the Rights of Investors Versus Public Interest?;10.1007/978-3-030-65355-2_12;This chapter reflects on the anticipated rush by private corporations to seek compensation from states for emergency measures taken to address the current health crisis. Where states have, for example, commandeered privately run health facilities, foreign corporations can claim for any negative impact on their current and future profits. This anticipated wave of state-investor litigation draws upon the web of bilateral investment treaties that span the globe and on Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanisms. In place of a “new normal,” this short paper suggests that these threats represent an intensification of an existing trend, with the main difference being that states of the Global North are increasingly finding themselves disciplined by instruments that they created to protect their own companies abroad. If this happens, as seems likely, this crisis will add to the growing calls to rethink how we regulate the boundary between the public interest and private investors.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978669/;20/3/2021;Investor-State Dispute Settlement;0.9704
1055;Hyperactive Delirium Requires More Aggressive Management in Patients with COVID-19: Temporarily Rethinking “Low and Slow”;10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.05.013;Delirium is a common symptom in patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19, and in cases of hyperactive delirium we have frequently observed behaviors that pose a significant risk of disease transmission to health care providers. Managing this symptom has emerged as an important challenge, as our local health care system has been strained by providers becoming sick or quarantined. Preventative and non-pharmacologic interventions remain critical for managing delirium in such patients, though occasionally pharmacologic treatment is required. When use of an antipsychotic medication is indicated, we recommend that providers consider foregoing the lowest common dose and instead start with the next incrementally higher dose to more quickly and reliably ensure the safety of both patients and providers. We do not recommend initiating prophylactic treatment or escalating doses in a manner that conflicts with currently accepted guidelines without carefully considering the risks and benefits;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392420303894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445904/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392420303894?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.05.013";21/5/2020;Delirium;0.98
1056;Reinventing How Pharmacy Educators Connect as a Community.;10.5688/ajpe8151;The onset of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has added a new layer of complexity to an already difficult period for academic pharmacy. The need to follow social-distancing guidelines has resulted in rapid adoption of technology-enabled communication strategies. While these technologies provide unprecedented ways in which we can connect as an academic community, we must consider their effectiveness in not only promoting exchange of information, but also creating inspiration within the community and supporting the level of interdependence required to tackle the difficult challenges that lie ahead. As the connecting body within the community of pharmacy education, it is incumbent on the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) to consider how we will adapt during this period of disruption. We must adopt new strategies that will allow our members to connect in new, meaningful ways, ways that stimulate ideas, new partnerships, and an overall sense of hope for our future.;"https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32665724/";1/6/2020;coronavirus;0.9905

In order to prevent cluster outbreaks, the government strengthened the management and control of personnel mobility, which had a great impact on the examination and treatment of breast cancer patients. This paper discusses how to realize scientific health management of breast cancer patients outside the hospital based on the existing epidemic situation, characteristics of breast cancer patients and public health safety factors. The breast cancer patients should synthetically consider the epidemic prevention situation of inhabitance, the disease stage and previous therapeutic schedule to decide the next therapeutic schedule. If necessary, after professional discussion and communication between doctors and patients online or offline, the hospital visiting time should be delayed through seeking alternative treatment schemes, and psychological counseling for patients should be paid attention to at the same time.;"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112152-20200221-00110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32100979/";26/2/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9366

A systematic literature review of Coronavirus related diseases in Pakistan.;10.3855/jidc.12771;Pakistan is also seeing the profound effect of the outbreak of COVID-19, which demands an urgent investigation of literature and further scientific investigation for cure and prevention. This study has employed the systematic approach for searching the literature from the recently compiled database of researches namely COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) and related diseases. The literature on Pakistan has shown the evidence of human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission of viruses, the presence of antibodies of MERS-CoV in camels, and careless attitude towards preventive measures of such respiratory diseases. There is a lot of gap in the literature regarding coronaviruses and their antibodies creating herd immunity for another coronavirus and COVID-19. In particular to Pakistan, and in general, for other developing countries, a weak health-care system coupled with the trembling economy has many implications of COVID-19 which should be carefully thought-out to combat the spread.;"https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32794461/";31/7/2020;Open Research Dataset;0.9764

1061;A midpoint perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic.;10.11622/smedj.2020036;The SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) epidemic has spread to virtually every continent in the world. Despite Singapore's efforts, sustained community transmission of the virus has continued. We herein describe several key experiences and lessons learnt during the early course of the outbreak. First, it is critical to evaluate the outbreak objectively based on its own characteristics and not those of past epidemics. Second, the great advancements in speed and power of science and international collaboration have been critical in providing knowledge about the virus and disease. Third, public risk communications and the need to combat false information and rumours are even more crucial in this age of social media and viral information spread. Lastly, outbreak control and mitigation goes beyond the healthcare sector. The many lessons learnt will serve as a blueprint for dealing with future pandemics, but a sustainable new normal is required for the immediate future.;"https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2020036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32211911/";25/3/2020;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;0.9021

Relevant information has emerged regarding the higher risk of poor outcomes in lung cancer patients. As such, lung cancer patients must be prioritized in terms of prevention, detection and treatment. On May 7th, 45 experts in thoracic cancers from 11 different countries were invited to participate. A core panel of experts regarding thoracic oncology care amidst the pandemic gathered virtually, and a total of 60 initial recommendations were drafted based on available evidence. By May 16th, 44 experts had agreed to participate, and voted on each recommendation using a Delphi panel on a live voting event. Consensus was reached regarding the recommendations (>66% strongly agree/agree) for 57 questions. Strong consensus (>80% strongly agree/agree) was reached for 45 questions.

1065;Lab-on-a-Chip Devices for Point-of-Care Medical Diagnostics.;10.1007/10_2020_127;The recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the need to move from traditional lab-centralized diagnostics to point-of-care (PoC) settings. Lab-on-a-chip (LoC) platforms facilitate the translation to PoC settings via the miniaturization, portability, integration, and automation of multiple assay functions onto a single chip. For this purpose, paper-based assays and microfluidic platforms are currently being extensively studied, and much focus is being directed towards simplifying their design while simultaneously improving multiplexing and automation capabilities. Signal amplification strategies are being applied to improve the performance of assays with respect to both sensitivity and selectivity, while smartphones are being integrated to expand the analytical power of the technology and promote its accessibility. In this chapter, we review the main technologies in the field of LoC platforms for PoC medical diagnostics and survey recent approaches for improving these assays.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/10_2020_127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32435872/";21/5/2020;coronavirus;0.9811
1066;Formation and Function of Liquid-Like Viral Factories in Negative-Sense Single-Stranded RNA Virus Infections;10.3390/v13010126;Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) represents a major physiochemical principle to organize intracellular membrane-less structures. Studies with non-segmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA viruses have uncovered a key role of LLPS in the formation of viral inclusion bodies (IBs), sites of viral protein concentration in the cytoplasm of infected cells. These studies further reveal the structural and functional complexity of viral IB factories and provide a foundation for their future research. Herein, we review the literature leading to the discovery of LLPS-driven formation of IBs in NNS RNA virus-infected cells and the identification of viral scaffold components involved, and then outline important questions and challenges for IB assembly and disassembly. We discuss the functional implications of LLPS in the life cycle of NNS RNA viruses and host responses to infection. Finally, we speculate on the potential mechanisms underlying IB maturation, a phenomenon relevant to many human diseases.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477448/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13010126";18/1/2021;Liquid–liquid phase separation;0.9057
1067;The rise of molecular simulations in fragment-based drug design (FBDD): an overview;10.1016/j.drudis.2020.06.023;Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) is an innovative approach, progressively more applied in the academic and industrial context, to enhance hit identification for previously considered undruggable biological targets. In particular, FBDD discovers low-molecular-weight (LMW) ligands (<300 Da) able to bind to therapeutically relevant macromolecules in an affinity range from the micromolar (μM) to millimolar (mM). X-ray crystallography (XRC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are commonly the methods of choice to obtain 3D information about the bound ligand–protein complex, but this can occasionally be problematic, mainly for early, low-affinity fragments. The recent development of computational fragment-based approaches provides a further strategy for improving the identification of fragment hits. In this review, we summarize the state of the art of molecular dynamics simulations approaches used in FBDD, and discuss limitations and future perspectives for these approaches.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32592867/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2020.06.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644620302518?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359644620302518";25/6/2020;Fragment-based drug discovery;0.9558

Strategies for managing opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnancy have been tested over the past 40 years, but studies have focused on maternal and pregnancy outcomes, with less attention given to long-term follow-up of exposed children. Here, we provide a narrative review of recent advances in the assessment and management of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), and we summarise evidence from multiple domains-neuroimaging, electrophysiology, visual development and function, neurodevelopment, behaviour, cognition and education-which suggests that prenatal opioid exposure modifies child development. Further studies are required to determine the optimal management of pregnant women with OUD and babies with NOWS.

The concept of a novel turbulence monitor based on recording sequences of ring-like intrafocal images and their analysis is presented. It can be implemented using standard inexpensive telescopes and cameras. Statistics of intensity fluctuations in the rings and their radial motion allow measurement of the low-resolution turbulence profile, the total seeing, and the atmospheric time constant. The algorithm of processing the images and extracting the turbulence parameters is developed and extensively tested by numerical simulation. Prescriptions to correct for finite exposure time and partially saturated scintillation are given. A prototype instrument with a 0.13-m aperture was tested on the sky. The RINGSS (Ring-Image Next Generation Scintillation Sensor) can be used as a portable turbulence monitor for site testing and as an upgrade of existing seeing monitors.;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13734v1.pdf;26/12/2020;Ring-Image Next Generation Scintillation Sensor;0.9072

Task Force on Repurposing of Drugs (TFORD) for COVID19 has tried to look at the overall position of India in terms of interventional clinical trials and highlight learnings which can prepare us to fight future pandemics in a better way. Trials registered on CTRI from March 2020 to December 2020 were considered for this purpose. From a total 409 trials registered, 108 focused on modern drugs. From 108 trials studied, 92 were randomized trials, 34 trials were sponsored by Indian Pharmaceutical industry, 23 were self-sponsored and 20 were sponsored by Research institutes and hospitals. Only 83 trials studied the repurposed drugs. An unfortunate revelation was that out of 108 trials, 79 showed as not yet recruiting. This highlights the urgent need for Government, Research institutions and Indian Pharmaceutical industries to break down silos and work together towards this common cause.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.16.21257299v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.16.21257299";18/5/2021;Task Force on Repurposing of Drugs;0.918
1078;Tracking Livestock Using a Fully Connected Network and Kalman Filter;10.1007/978-3-030-72073-5_19;Multiple object tracking (MOT) consists of following the trajectories of different objects in a video with either fixed or moving background. In recent years, the use of deep learning for MOT in the videos recorded by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has introduced more challenges and hence has a lot of room for extensive research. For the tracking-by-detection method, the three main components, object detector, tracker and data associator, play an equally important role and each part should be tuned to the highest efficiency to increase the overall performance. In this paper, the parameter selection of the Kalman filter and Hungarian algorithm for sheep tracking in paddock videos is discussed. An experimental comparison is presented to show that if the detector is already providing good results, a small change in the system can degrade or improve the tracking capabilities of remaining components. The encouraging results provide an important step in an automated UAV-based sheep tracking system.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971817/;18/3/2021;Multiple object tracking;0.9253
1079;Therapeutic potential of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in preventing cytokine storm in COVID-19: review of current evidence.;10.26355/eurrev_202103_25442;Since November 2019, SARS Coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread through more than 195 nations worldwide. Though the coronavirus infection affects all age and sex groups, the mortality is skewed towards the elderly population and the cause of death is mostly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are data suggesting the role of excessive immune activation and cytokine storm as the cause of lung injury in COVID-19. The excessive immune activation and cytokine storm usually occurs due to an imbalance in redox homeostasis of the individuals. Considering the antioxidant and free radical scavenging action of N acetyl cysteine (NAC), its use might be useful in COVID-19 patients by decreasing the cytokine storm consequently decreasing the disease severity. Therefore, we reviewed all the available resources pertaining to the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cytokine storm and the mechanism of action of NAC in preventing ROS. We also reviewed the use of NAC in COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202103_25442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829465/";1/3/2021;SARS Coronavirus 2 disease;0.9521

1081;Gene of the month: TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2);10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206987;Transmembrane serine protease 2 is encoded by the TMPRSS2 gene. The gene is widely conserved and has two isoforms, both being autocatalytically activated from the inactive zymogen form. A fusion gene between the TMPRSS2 gene and ERG (erythroblast-specific-related gene), an oncogenic transcription factor, is the most common chromosomal aberration detected in prostate cancer, responsible for driving carcinogenesis. The other key role of TMPRSS2 is in priming the viral spike protein which facilitates viral entry essential for viral infectivity. The protease activates a diverse range of viruses. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2 to facilitate entry to cells, but with SARS-CoV-2 human-to-human transmission is much higher than SARS-CoV. As TMPRSS2 is expressed outside of the lung, and can therefore contribute to extrapulmonary spread of viruses, it warrants further exploration as a potential target for limiting viral spread and infectivity.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32873700/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206987";1/9/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9684

The biogas yield and organics removal due to pretreatment were compared with the raw stillage AD. The application of a scoria support in this industrial residue AD process stability was also assessed. Consequently, a statistically significant cumulative specific methane recovery difference (p-value = 0.000) with an almost complete biological oxygen demand (BOD) removal and a significant chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction, which were 100% and 92% respectively were achieved. Additionally, the biogas recovery rate was hastened due to pretreatment. The application of scoria, whose property has been instrumentally inspected, has helped stabilize the pH in the AD systems.

For an average Web user, it is very difficult to identify which information is relevant or irrelevant. Hence, in the era of continuously enhancing Web, organization and interpretation of Web contents are very important in order to easily access the relevant information. Many recent advancements in the area of Web content management such as classification of Web contents, information diffusion, credibility of information, etc. have been explored based on text and semantic of the document. In this paper, we propose a purely semantic contextualization of Web contents. We hypothesize that named entities and their types present in a Web document convey substantial semantic information. By extraction of this information, we aim to study the reasoning and explanation behind the Web contents or patterns.

Application of water as the liquid phase for suspension preparation is promising due to its availability, low cost and no toxicity. In the present study, the effects of three surfactants, polyethyleneimine (PEI), 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (PBTCA) and α-Terpineol, on the functional stability of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) water-based suspensions were investigated. The changes in the suspensions’ zeta potential, pH, viscosity and Turbiscan Stability Index (TSI) were monitored over their aging time of 1 to 7 days. The results showed that α-Terpineol is the most effective surfactant to produce functionally stable suspensions with low viscosity and surface tension values. Plasma spraying of such stable suspensions results in the formation of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with columnar morphology having porosity in the range of 17 to 18 vol.%.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847716/;31/1/2021;Suspension stability;0.9467

This has been fuelled in part by the clinical success of B cell depletion therapies (BCDTs). Originally conceived as a method of eliminating cancerous B cells, BCDTs such as those targeting CD20, CD19 and BAFF are now used to treat autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis. The use of BCDTs in autoimmune disease has led to some surprises. For example, although antibody-secreting plasma cells are thought to have a negative pathogenic role in autoimmune disease, BCDT, even when it controls the disease, has limited impact on these cells and on antibody levels.

Physical distancing, travel restrictions, and emphasis on hygiene are likely to have affected the number of expected notifications, with the greatest reductions observed among disease spread via person-to-person contact such as influenza, and among overseas-acquired infections such as dengue virus and measles. However, quantifying the magnitude of the effect of COVID-19 public health measures on communicable diseases in Australia will be difficult, due to confounding factors such as: changes in testing priorities in laboratories; diversion of resources to the COVID-19 response; changes in health-seeking behaviours; greater utilisation of telehealth practices; and financial impacts such as income loss and ability to afford healthcare.

The interaction of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) with its main host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has emerged as a critical focal point for the development of anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. Utilizing our recently developed NanoBiT technology-based biosensor, we selectively identify and characterize the impact of mutating certain amino acid residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and in ACE2. Specifically, we examine the mutational effects on RBD-ACE2 binding ability, before and after the addition of competitive inhibitors, as well as neutralizing antibody activity. These critical determinants of virus-host interactions may provide more effective targets for ongoing vaccines, drug development, and potentially pave the way for determining the genetic variation underlying disease severity.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.428773;29/1/2021;viral receptor binding domain;0.9304

A CAD solution helps teachers get instant feedback on their pedagogical instructions. However, CAD is very challenging because (1) classroom conversations contain many conversational turn-taking overlaps between teachers and students; (2) the CAD model needs to be generalized well enough for different teachers and students; and (3) classroom recordings may be very noisy and low-quality. In this work, we address the above challenges by building a Siamese neural framework to automatically identify teacher and student utterances from classroom recordings. The proposed model is evaluated on real-world educational datasets. The results demonstrate that (1) our approach is superior on the prediction tasks for both online and offline classroom environments; and (2) our framework exhibits robustness and generalization ability on new teachers (i.e., teachers never appear in training data).";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334716/;10/6/2020;Classroom activity detection;0.9843

Therefore, we screened an FDA-approved drug library and also examined available inhibitors against PLpro. Inhibitor GRL0617 showed a promising IC50 of 2.1 μM. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro-C111S in complex with GRL0617 suggests that GRL0617 is a non-covalent inhibitor. NMR data indicate that GRL0617 blocks the binding of ISG15 to PLpro. The antiviral activity of GRL0617 reveal that PLpro is a promising drug target for therapeutically treating COVID-19. One Sentence Summary Co-crystal structure of PLpro in complex with GRL0617 reveals the druggability of PLpro for SARS-CoV-2 treatment.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.17.208959;18/7/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9037

1104;A multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for antibiotic stewardship in suspected pneumonia();10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.115179;BACKGROUND: Multiplexed molecular rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may allow for rapid and accurate diagnosis of the microbial etiology of pneumonia. However, little data are available on multiplexed RDTs in pneumonia and their impact on clinical practice. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 659 hospitalized patients for microbiological diagnosis of suspected pneumonia. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the Unyvero LRT Panel was 85.7% (95% CI 82.3–88.7) and the overall specificity was 98.4% (95% CI 98.2–98.7) with a negative predictive value of 97.9% (95% CI 97.6–98.1). The LRT Panel result predicted no change in antibiotics in 12.4% of cases but antibiotic de-escalation in 65.9% (405/615) of patients, of whom 278/405 (69%) had unnecessary MRSA coverage and 259/405 (64%) had unnecessary P. aeruginosa coverage. INTERPRETATION. In hospitalized adults with suspected pneumonia, use of an RDT on respiratory samples can allow for early adjustment of initial antibiotics, most commonly de-escalation.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889320305563?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889320305563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32927409/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.115179";16/8/2020;Multiplexed molecular rapid diagnostic tests;0.9694
1105;Just-In-Time Tools for Training Non–Critical Care Providers. Troubleshooting Problems in the Ventilated Patient;10.34197/ats-scholar.2020-0038in;Due to the limited number of critical care providers in the United States, even well-staffed hospitals are at risk of exhausting both physical and human resources during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One potential response to this problem is redeployment of non–critical care providers to increase the supply of available clinicians. To support efforts to increase capacity as part of surge preparation for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, we created an online educational resource for non-intensivist providers to learn basic critical care content. Among those materials, we created a series of one-page learning guides for the management of common problems encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU). These guides were meant to be used as just-in-time tools to guide problem-solving during the provision of ICU care. This article presents five guides related to managing complications that can arise in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870282/; https://doi.org/10.34197/ats-scholar.2020-0038in";29/6/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9668

Typical military protective suits have drawbacks such as high weight, bulky structure, and unpredictable lifetime. A durable, light, and scalable graphene e-fabric was fabricated from CVD-grown graphene by a simple co-lamination method. The sheet resistance was below 1 kΩ/sq over the wide surface area even after 1000 bending cycles. A graphene triboelectric nanogenerator showed the peak V(OC) of 68 V and the peak I(CC) of 14.4 μA and 1 μF capacitor was charged successfully in less than 1 s. A wearable chemical sensor was also fabricated and showed a sensitivity up to 53% for nerve chemical warfare agents (GD). DFT calculations were conducted to unveil the fundamental mechanisms underlying the graphene e-fabric sensor. Additionally, protection against chemical warfare agents was tested, and a design concept of graphene-based intelligent protective clothing has been proposed.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11040940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33917143/";7/4/2021;nerve chemical warfare agents;0.9486
1108;Targeting conserved viral virulence determinants by single domain antibodies to block SARS-CoV2 infectivity;10.1101/2021.01.13.426537;We selected SARS-CoV2 specific single domain antibodies (sdAbs) from a previously constructed phage display library using synthetic immunogenic peptides of the virus spike (S) protein as bait. The sdAbs targeting the cleavage site (CS) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in S protein efficiently neutralised the infectivity of a pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV2 S protein. Anti-CS sdAb blocked the virus infectivity by inhibiting proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV2 S protein. Both the sdAbs retained characteristic structure within the pH range of 2 to 12 and remained stable upto 65°C. Furthermore, structural disruptions induced by a high temperature in both the sdAbs were largely reversed upon their gradual cooling and the resulting products neutralised the reporter virus. Our results therefore suggest that targeting CS in addition to the RBD of S protein by sdAbs could serve as a viable option to reduce SARS-CoV2 infectivity and that proteolytic processing of the viral S protein is critical for infection.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.426537;13/1/2021;receptor binding domain;0.9478
1109;Mucosal Associated Invariant T Cells Were Activated and Polarized Toward Th17 in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;10.3389/fimmu.2021.640455;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by airway limitation accompanied with infiltration of inflammatory cells. Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells can recognize bacteria and play an important role in controlling host immune responses by producing cytokines. In this study, we characterized the function and the ability of MAIT cells to secrete cytokines measured by flow cytometry. In COPD patients, MAIT cells have the ability to produce more IL-17 and less IFN-γ compared to healthy individuals. We found that HLA-DR expression levels reflected the degree of inflammation and the proportion of IL-17 was significantly correlated with lung function in peripheral blood. In addition, we found that MAIT cells were highly expressed in the lung, and the increased expression of CXCR2, CXCL1 indicated that MAIT cells had the potential to migrate to inflammatory tissues. This evidence implies that MAIT cells may play a potential role in COPD immunopathology.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044354/;31/3/2021;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9659

1111;Transformer-based approach towards music emotion recognition from lyrics;10.1007/978-3-030-72240-1_12;The task of identifying emotions from a given music track has been an active pursuit in the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community for years. Music emotion recognition has typically relied on acoustic features, social tags, and other metadata to identify and classify music emotions. The role of lyrics in music emotion recognition remains under-appreciated in spite of several studies reporting superior performance of music emotion classifiers based on features extracted from lyrics. In this study, we use the transformer-based approach model using XLNet as the base architecture which, till date, has not been used to identify emotional connotations of music based on lyrics. Our proposed approach outperforms existing methods for multiple datasets. We used a robust methodology to enhance web-crawlers' accuracy for extracting lyrics. This study has important implications in improving applications involved in playlist generation of music based on emotions in addition to improving music recommendation systems.;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02051v1.pdf;6/1/2021;Music Information Retrieval;0.9297
1112;Human erythroid progenitors are directly infected by SARS-CoV-2: implications for emerging erythropoiesis in severe COVID19 patients.;10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.02.001;We document here that intensive care COVID19 patients suffer a profound decline in hemoglobin levels but show an increase of circulating nucleated red cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection either directly or indirectly induces stress erythropoiesis. We show that ACE2 expression peaks during erythropoiesis and renders erythroid progenitors vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Early erythroid progenitors, defined as CD34-CD117+CD71+CD235a-, show the highest levels of ACE2 and constitute the primary target cell to be infected during erythropoiesis. SARS-CoV-2 causes the expansion of colony formation by erythroid progenitors and can be detected in these cells after two weeks of the initial infection. Our findings constitute the first report of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in erythroid progenitor cells and can contribute to understanding both the clinical symptoms of severe COVID19 patients and how the virus can spread through the circulation to produce local inflammation in tissues, including the bone marrow.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.02.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213671121000527?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213671121000527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33581053/";5/2/2021;intensive care;0.9765

It is therefore distressing that there is major disagreement about the optimal serum level for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and appropriate supplement dose. The UK Scientific Advisory Committee for Nutrition has set the lowest level for defining sufficiency (10 ng/ml or 25 nmol/L) of any national advisory body or scientific society and consequently recommends supplementation with 10 micrograms (400 IU) per day. We have searched for published evidence to support this but not found it. There is considerable evidence to support the higher level for sufficiency (20 ng/ml or 50 nmol/L) recommended by the European Food Safety Authority and the American Institute of Medicine and hence greater supplementation (20 micrograms or 800 IU per day). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the UK typically fall by around 50% through winter. We believe that governments should urgently recommend supplementation with 20-25 micrograms (800-1,000 IU) per day.;"https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33158957/";6/11/2020;vitamin D deficiency;0.917

To date, no effective drug is available to directly treat the disease and prevent virus spreading. In a search for a drug against COVID-19, we have performed a massive X-ray crystallographic screen of two repurposing drug libraries against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which is essential for the virus replication and, thus, a potent drug target. In contrast to commonly applied X-ray fragment screening experiments with molecules of low complexity, our screen tested already approved drugs and drugs in clinical trials. From the three-dimensional protein structures, we identified 37 compounds binding to Mpro. In subsequent cell-based viral reduction assays, one peptidomimetic and five non-peptidic compounds showed antiviral activity at non-toxic concentrations. We identified two allosteric binding sites representing attractive targets for drug development against SARS-CoV-2.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.12.378422;23/11/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9569

Research indicates a possible impact on health by reducing poverty, fostering health-promoting behaviour and ameliorating biopsychosocial pathways to health. This novel case for UBI as a public health measure is starting to receive attention from a range of political positions and organisations. However, discussion of the ethical underpinnings of UBI as a public health policy is sparse. This is depriving policymakers of clear perspectives about the reasons for, restrictions to and potential for the policy’s design and implementation.

1119;Superposition of COVID‐19 waves, anticipating a sustained wave, and lessons for the future;10.1002/bies.202000178;The 2019 coronavirus (COVID‐19), also known as SARS‐CoV‐2, is highly pathogenic and virulent, and it spreads very quickly through human‐to‐human contact. In response to the growing number of cases, governments across the spectrum of affected countries have adopted different strategies in implementing control measures, in a hope to reduce the number of new cases. However, 5 months after the first confirmed case, countries like the United States of America (US) seems to be heading towards a trajectory that indicates a health care crisis. This is in stark contrast to the downward trajectory in Europe, China, and elsewhere in Asia, where the number of new cases has seen a decline ahead of an anticipated second wave. A data‐driven approach reveals three key strategies in tackling COVID‐19.

To date, thousands of genetic variants have been identified across strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from worldwide patients. However, there is still little direct evidence linking viral variants and clinical features. Based on two tightly linked SNPs, we previously divided SARS-CoV-2 into two major lineages: the ancestral ‘S lineage’ (U8,782 and C28,144) and the derived ‘L lineage’ (C8,782 and U28,144). Here, we identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages from 271 COVID-19 patients during the early outbreak of this pandemic in Wuhan, including 73 S- and 198 L-lineage patients. The S-lineage patients exhibited significantly worse clinical severity than the L-lineage patients, even after excluding other risk factors. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 lineage may provide useful clinical information for the management of COVID-19 and support the argument that viral clades should be analyzed as a function of clinical severity.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8244779/;28/5/2021;the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2;0.9258

Existing HAR approaches have adopted supervised machine learning algorithms using texts and their meta-data such as time, venue, and keywords.

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised multi-modal deep embedding clustering method to recognize human activities on Instagram. Our proposed method learns multi-modal feature representations by alternating a supervised learning phase and an unsupervised learning phase. By utilizing a large number of unlabeled data, it learns a more generalized feature distribution for each HAR class and avoids overfitting to limited labeled data. Evaluation results show that leveraging multi-modality and unlabeled data is effective for HAR and our method outperforms existing approaches.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206193/;17/4/2020;Human Activity Recognition;0.9103

Since antiquity, textiles have been proven to be intertwined with human lives and the integrant of these crucial materials are fibers. Particularly, nanofiber fabrics manufactured by electrospinning have attracted attention, owing to the better filtration efficiency and breathability. In addition, the electrospinning process provide opportunities to fine tuning of the surface functionality through polymer chemistry and an encapsulation of bioactive agents in single step process. This review opens up a new horizon in possible textile applications especially, an active layer of bioactive agent (Curcumin and Moringa) loaded nanofibrous fabrics-based facemasks for day to day life.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2021.02.367; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214785321014772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718003/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785321014772";8/3/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9829
1125;The effective reproductive number (Rt) of COVID-19 and its relationship with social distancing;10.1101/2020.07.28.20163493;The expansion of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) triggered a renewed public interest in epidemiological models and on how parameters can be estimated from observed data. Here we investigated the relationship between average number of transmissions though time, the reproductive number Rt, and social distancing index as reported by mobile phone data service inloco, for Goias State, Brazil, between March and June 2020. We calculated Rt values using EpiEstim package in R-plataform for confirmed cases incidence curves. We found a correlation equal to -0.72 between Rt values for confirmed cases and isolation index at a time lag of 8 days. As the Rt values were paired with center of the moving window of 7 days, the delay matches the mean incubation period of the virus. Our findings reinforce that isolation index can be an effective surrogate for modeling and epidemiological analyses and, more importantly, can be an useful metrics for anticipating the need for early interventions, a critical issue in public health.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.28.20163493; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.28.20163493v1?rss=1";29/7/2020;coronavirus disease;0.931

Patients who recover from COVID-19 are still susceptible to reinfection. In this report, we present the case of a patient who had recovered from COVID-19. Recovery was defined as the resolution of symptoms accompanied by two consecutive SARS-CoV-2-negative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results. Two months after the first infection, the patient tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Three months after this test, the patient presented with mild COVID-19 symptoms that was confirmed by RT-PCR. These findings indicate a possible reinfection case. If the occurrence of reinfections is demonstrated to be true, then it may change the strategy of community-based disease prevention. More research is needed to confirm the concept of reinfection.;"https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2396_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195145/";31/5/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9224

Hermetically sealed eye protection fully protects the eyes from particles, but tend to fog up rendering unusable. The purpose of this study was build and test a filtered eye mask (FEM) to protect the eyes from airborne particles while being usable without excessive fog build up. Methods The steps performed to build the FEM were described. A hermetically-sealed standard eye mask (SEM) and a FEM were examined at 1minute, 5minutes and 60minute period for performance metrics relating to fog. Results The SEM showed minimal fog at 1-minute, very foggy at 5-minutes and dripping with condensation at 60minutes. The FEM was clear at 1-minute, 5-minutes and showed minimal fog at 60minutes. Conclusion The FEM may play an important role in preventing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) exposure by protecting the eyes from airborne particles and preventing fog, rendering it usable.

1128;Molecular investigation of adequate sources of mesenchymal stem cells for cell therapy of COVID‐19‐associated organ failure;10.1002/sctm.20-0189;The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from several sources as a major anti‐inflammation strategy has been suggested in the recent outbreak of Coronavirus‐19 (COVID‐19). As the virus enters the target cells through the receptor ACE2, it is important to determine if the MSC population transfused to patients could also be a target for the virus entry. We report here that ACE2 is highly expressed in adult bone marrow, adipose tissue or umbilical cord‐derived MSC. On the other hand, placenta‐derived MSC express low levels of ACE2 but only in early passages of cultures. MSC derived from human embryonic stem cell (hESC) or human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) express also very low levels of ACE2. The transcriptome analysis of the MSCs with lowest expression of ACE2 in fetal‐like MSCs is found to be associated in particularly with an anti‐inflammatory signature. These results are of major interest for designing future clinical MSC‐based stem cell therapies for severe COVID‐19 infections.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.20-0189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33237619/";25/11/2020;Coronavirus‐19;0.9874
1129;Uremic Toxins and Their Relation with Oxidative Stress Induced in Patients with CKD;10.3390/ijms22126196;The presence of toxins is believed to be a major factor in the development of uremia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Uremic toxins have been divided into 3 groups: small substances dissolved in water, medium molecules: peptides and low molecular weight proteins, and protein-bound toxins. One of the earliest known toxins is urea, the concentration of which was considered negligible in CKD patients. However, subsequent studies have shown that it can lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and induce insulin resistance in vitro and in vivo, as well as cause carbamylation of proteins, peptides, and amino acids. Other uremic toxins and their participation in the damage caused by oxidative stress to biological material are also presented. Macromolecules and molecules modified as a result of carbamylation, oxidative stress, and their adducts with uremic toxins, may lead to cardiovascular diseases, and increased risk of mortality in patients with CKD.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201270/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22126196";8/6/2021;end-stage renal disease;0.9895
1130;Preparation of Cultured Cells Using High-Pressure Freezing and Freeze Substitution for Subsequent 2D or 3D Visualization in the Transmission Electron Microscope;10.1007/978-1-0716-0900-2_19;Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is an invaluable technique used for imaging the ultrastructure of samples, and it is particularly useful when determining virus–host interactions at a cellular level. The environment inside a TEM is not favorable for biological material (high vacuum and high energy electrons). Also biological samples have little or no intrinsic electron contrast and rarely do they naturally exist in very thin sheets, as is required for optimum resolution in the TEM. To prepare these samples for imaging in the TEM therefore requires extensive processing which can alter the ultrastructure of the material. Here we describe a method which aims to minimize preparation artifacts by freezing the samples at high pressure to instantaneously preserve ultrastructural detail, then rapidly substituting the ice with resin to provide a firm matrix which can be cut into thin sections for imaging. Thicker sections of this material can also be imaged and reconstructed into 3D volumes using electron tomography.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-0900-2_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833218/";11/5/2020;Transmission electron microscopy;0.9323

Using a simultaneous equations approach, our main findings indicate that the proportion of independent directors, the board size, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) power affected bank risk-taking negatively during the recent financial crisis. On the contrary, institutional shareholder ownership and the presence of an ex-CEO as Chairman influenced bank risk-taking positively. Additionally, we separately analyse stable and crisis periods and observe that in the pre-crisis period only board independence and institutional ownership keep the same impact on risk while CEO power has no influence and the existence of an ex-CEO as Chairman reduces risk-taking by banks. We conclude that different governance characteristics have different relevance for banks' risk-taking contingent on the economic environment being one of stability or crisis.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993444/;25/3/2021;Chief Executive Officer;0.9617

Understanding how crisis influence an individual's reactions to stressful events (and vice versa) is important in order to create meaningful and effective interventions. Our literature search have revealed lack of the papers related to psychodynamic approach to recent crisis. Psychodynamic places a large emphasis on defense mechanisms and unconscious mind, where upsetting feelings, urges, and thoughts that are too painful for us to directly look at are housed. Even though these painful feelings and thoughts are outside of our awareness, they still influence our behavior in many ways. Optimal application of psychodynamic approach offers the frame for acceptance of psychological stress in a more positive way and benefits psychological growth. We believe that including psychodynamic approach in the national public and mental health emergency system will empower Croatia and the world during (and after) COVID-19 pandemic crisis.;"https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303024/";1/1/2020;coronavirus;0.9202

1148;Purchase experience during the COVID‐19 pandemic and social cognitive theory: The relevance of consumer vulnerability, resilience, and adaptability for purchase satisfaction and repurchase;10.1111/ijcs.12672;This study explores consumer behavior during the pandemic through the lens of social cognitive theory (SCT). Using the SCT framework and assessing the pandemic as an environmental set, this study strives to fill the gaps in the underexplored impacts of the personal processes of consumer vulnerability, resilience, and adaptability on the behavioral processes of purchase satisfaction and repurchase. The research results show that consumers are self‐efficacious to a degree when it comes to purchase decision making in the context of pandemics. Vulnerability and resilience directly influence the purchase satisfaction and indirectly influence the repurchase intention via satisfaction. Furthermore, purchase satisfaction positively affects the repurchase intention. In addition, research results show that consumer adaptability to online shopping moderates the relationship between consumer resilience and purchase satisfaction. These findings have practical implications in terms of marketers’ communication strategy development.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcs.12672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821146/";10/3/2021;social cognitive theory;0.938

The aim of our study is to evaluate stationary wavelet transform (SWT) technique performance in efficient reconstruction of pure epileptic high frequency oscillations, reputed as biomarkers of epileptogenic zones: generators of inter ictal epileptic discharges, and offhand seizures. We applied SWT on simulated and real database to detect non-contaminated HFO by spiky element. For simulated data, we computed the GOF of reconstruction that reaches for all studied constraint (relative amplitude, frequency, SNR and overlap) a promising results. For real data we used time frequency domain to evaluate SWT robustness of HFO reconstruction. We proved that SWT is an efficient filtering technique for separation HFO from spiky events. Our results would have an important impact on the definition of epileptogenic zones.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313276/;31/5/2020;magnetoencephalography;0.9161

PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of QoL, resilience, and associated factors among nursing faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS In April 2020, a cross-sectional, anonymous survey was conducted with nursing faculty in a public university in rural Appalachia (n = 52). Instruments included QoL, resilience scales, work-related, and demographic variables. Descriptive, bivariate, and multiple linear regression analyses were used to analyze data. A content analysis was used to analyze an open-ended question. RESULTS Resilience was the strongest variable to predict each of the QoL domains. Nursing faculty who reported better QoL were those who were able to adapt to changes and challenges mandated during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1152;Can transdisciplinary approaches contribute to the COVID-19 fight?;10.1177/17579759211002376;Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) raised many questions needing answers in order to overcome the disease burden globally. Uncertainty about COVID-19 contributes to the complexity of the burden on the health, social, economic, and cultural influences of COVID-19. In this context, all related disciplines are working together to mitigate the negative influences of the disease. In particular, health promotion, a discipline of public health, matters to the pandemic as it may address the threats at different levels. Health promotion strategies mostly use solution-oriented efforts with inter- and multidisciplinary approaches. Nevertheless, as the COVID-19 burden has many time-critical determinants, these approaches cannot be sufficient to overcome the problem. A transdisciplinary approach in its broader sense using almost all inputs to synthesize and produce an integrative solution may be extremely helpful. In this paper, the importance of transdisciplinary approaches in health promotion to combat COVID-19 has been discussed.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/17579759211002376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908313/";28/4/2021;Novel Coronavirus Disease;0.9784

We examined the number of NCD-related emergency hospital admissions during the years 1998 to 2018 in the UK. METHODS Demographic features for those admitted as an emergency with NCDs as their primary diagnosis were collated for all admissions in England, Wales and Scotland. NCDs recorded as secondary diagnoses for all admissions in England from 2012 to 2018 were additionally recorded. RESULTS We identified 120,662,155 emergency episodes of care. From 1998 to 2018 there was an increase from 1,416,233 to 1,892,501 in annual emergency admissions due to NCDs. This, however, represented a fall in the proportion of NCD among all emergency admissions, from 33.4% to 26.9%. Mean age of all patients admitted increased from 46.3 to 53.8 years. CONCLUSION Despite a fall in proportion of NCD admissions, the population acutely admitted to hospital was increasingly elderly and increasingly comorbid.;"https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762384/";1/3/2021;Non-communicable diseases;0.9278

However, neurological symptoms have also been observed in some patients. The cause of these complications is currently unknown. Here, we use human pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We find expression of viral receptor ACE2 in mature choroid plexus cells expressing abundant lipoproteins, but not in neurons or other cell types. We challenge organoids with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells, but little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells are apolipoprotein and ACE2 expressing cells of the choroid plexus epithelial barrier. Finally, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 damages the choroid plexus epithelium, leading to leakage across this important barrier that normally prevents entry of pathogens, immune cells and cytokines into cerebrospinal fluid and the brain.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33113348/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590920304951?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.10.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1934590920304951";13/10/2020;Coronavirus disease-19;0.9921

Two weeks later, the first three imported cases of COVID-19 into Europe were diagnosed in France. We sequenced 97 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from samples collected between January 24 and March 24, 2020 from infected patients in France. Phylogenetic analysis identified several early independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions without local transmission, highlighting the efficacy of the measures taken to prevent virus spread from symptomatic cases. In parallel, our genomic data reveals the later predominant circulation of a major clade in many French regions, and implies local circulation of the virus in undocumented infections prior to the wave of COVID-19 cases.

HCV-related arthritis is one of the extrahepatic manifestations of the disease. The treatment of chronic HCV has been revolutionized with the introduction of oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs. We aim to determine the outcomes of treatment by the combination of sofosbuvir-daclatasvir with or without ribavirin in patients with HCV-related arthritis. RESULTS: Post-therapy, all group I patients had sustained viral response. Significant improvement of the outcome parameters was found 12 weeks post-treatment in group I compared to baseline and group II. Complete and partial remission of articular symptoms in group I patients was observed in 80% and 5%, respectively, while 85% of patients in group II showed no remission.

1171;Respiratory viral infections during pregnancy: effects of SARS-CoV-2 and other related viruses over the offspring.;10.1017/s2040174420001373;Little is known about the consequences of viral infection for pregnant woman or for the fetus. This issue became important with the appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory syndrome known as COVID-19. The fast spreading around the world and the fact that without a treatment or vaccine humans are completely exposed, converts emerging viral diseases in a significant risk for pregnant women and their infants. At this time, during SARS-CoV-2 pandemics pregnant women are not considered as a risk population and little is known about the effects of viral infections over the offspring although the amount of emerging evidence showing detrimental effects for the mother and the fetus. This issue highlights the importance to understand the effects of viral infections during pregnancy.

1172;Social Distancing During the COVID‐19 Pandemic: Who Are the Present and Future Non‐compliers?;10.1111/puar.13240;Social distancing is an effective means for containing the spread of COVID‐19, but only so if we all participate. Who are the individuals who are the least likely to adhere to social distancing recommendations, presently and in the long‐term? Such knowledge is important for policymakers looking to sustain the public's buy‐in to social distancing. Using survey data from sample U.S. residents (n = 1,449), we show that some demographic factors (gender, age, race, political party) help predict intent to adhere to social distancing. Yet demographic factors are relatively poor predictors compared to individual attitudes and media diets. We argue that public officials should make efforts to inform and persuade the public of the importance of social distancing, targeting mediums like TV and radio where audiences are less likely to currently engage in social distancing or are less likely to envision themselves sustaining strict social distancing for several weeks or months.

Interferon-α (IFN-α), lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine phosphate, arbidol, ribavirin, remdesivir, and dexamethasone are the therapeutic drugs recommended for treating 2019-nCoV disease (COVID-19 disease). Due to the particularity of immune function, pregnant women seem to be more susceptible to the virus. We searched the literature to find effective and safe drugs for patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy and to provide drug therapy strategies for medical staff. According to the current literature we reviewed, we suggest that IFN-α and arbidol can be retained in the treatment regimen for pregnant women and that to reduce maternal mortality, appropriate doses of dexamethasone can be given to those who are predicted to have low premature survival and to receive mechanical ventilation or oxygen. However, the use of dexamethasone in the 1st trimester and after 37 weeks of gestation should be avoided.;"https://doi.org/10.5414/cp203817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33191908/";16/11/2020;2019-nCoV disease;0.9605

We refer to these as the immunome. Because of its diversity and complexity, the immunome provides singular opportunities for advancing personalized medicine by serving as the substrate for a highly multiplexed, near-universal blood test. Here we discuss some of these opportunities, the current state of immunome-based diagnostics, and highlight some of the challenges involved.

Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the main cause of death: its management and treatment should be tailored to the individual COVID-19 patient’s phenotype. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is paramount for disease treatment and infection control. Naso-pharyngeal (NP) swab is commonly used as screening and diagnostic tool for COVID-19, but in some cases it can be resulted negative even in presence of clinical and epidemiological criteria, and typical radiological and laboratory findings of COVID-19, as we have observed.

Using the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as a backdrop, this online survey experiment (N = 393) examined the effect of jargon use across three different topics that varied in situational urgency: COVID-19 (high urgency), flood risk (low urgency), and federal emergency policy (control). Results revealed that although the use of jargon led to more difficult processing and reduced persuasion for the two less-urgent topics (flood risk, emergency policy), there was no effect of jargon in the COVID-19 condition. Theoretically, these findings suggest that the motivation to process information is an important moderator for crisis communication in particular and science communication in general.

The algorithm incorporates patient-reported features (age, fever, new cough), audio data from five coughs and can be deployed by novice users. We compared the accuracy of the algorithm to expert clinical assessment. In patients with known COPD, the algorithm correctly identified the presence of AECOPD in 82.6% (95% CI: 72.9-89.9%) of subjects (n=86). The absence of AECOPD was correctly identified in 91.0% (95% CI: 82.4-96.3%) of individuals (n=78). Diagnostic agreement was maintained in milder cases of AECOPD (PPA: 79.2%, 95% CI: 68.0-87.8%), who typically comprise the cohort presenting to primary care.

Liverpool University Dental Hospital (LUDH) responded by commencing an emergency dental service on the same date. Clinicians were redeployed within the Hospital to meet the needs of the service, including staffing of the radiology department. LUDH followed Royal College recommendations by taking extraoral radiographs in preference to intraoral radiographs due to the risk of inducing an aerosol. Issues were identified with clinical diagnosis from sectional panoramic radiographs, which led to the introduction of extraoral bitewings being taken as an alternative. A quality assurance audit found that these images provided a substantially lower radiation dose and produced excellent quality images with improved diagnostic accuracy.

However, the current primary in vitro models in use for SARS-CoV-2 display apparent limitations for modeling such complex human respiratory disease. While patient cells can directly model the effects of a drug, their availability and capacity for expansion are limited compared to the transformed/immortalized cells or the tumor-derived cell lines. What's more, the latter may harbor genetic and metabolic abnormalities in the course of their derivation, making them unsuitable for drug screening. Therefore, it is important to create physiologically relevant human-cell models that can replicate the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, thus, facilitating drug testing.

Among those materials, we created a series of one-page learning guides for the management of common problems encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU). These guides were meant to be used as just-in-time tools to guide problem-solving during the provision of ICU care. This article presents five guides related to the evaluation and management of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure and the basics of invasive mechanical ventilation.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870281/; https://doi.org/10.34197/ats-scholar.2020-0039in";29/6/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9654

1197;Age profile of susceptibility, mixing, and social distancing shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China;10.1101/2020.03.19.20039107;Strict interventions were successful to control the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China. As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. These findings can help guide global intervention policies.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511428/";20/3/2020;coronavirus;0.9063
1198;The pathway to comfort: Role of palliative care for serious COVID-19 illness;10.25259/ijms_157_2020;The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to significant distress among people of all age groups. Patients with advanced age and severe life-limiting illnesses are at increased risk of death from COVID-19. Not all patients presenting with severe illness will be eligible for aggressive intensive treatment. In limited resource setting, patients may be triaged for supportive care only. This subset of patients should be promptly identified and receive appropriate palliative care with adequate symptom control strategies and psychosocial support. Breathlessness, delirium, pain, and noisy breathing are main symptoms among these patients which can add to the suffering at end-of-life. The COVID-19 pandemic also contributes to the psychological distress due to stigma of the illness, uncertainty of the illness course, fear of death and dying in isolation, and anticipatory grief in families. Empathetic communication and holistic psychosocial support are important in providing good palliative care in COVID-19 patients and their families.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7485644/;21/8/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9499

Lipidomics identified dietary palmitic acid (C16:0; PA) may be acting as a primary inflammatory stimulus in our model. Here we show PA induces a hyper-inflammatory response to LPS challenge in cultured macrophages and in vivo, correlating with increased endotoxemia mortality and enhanced resistance to C. albicans infection in RAG-/- mice.

The B cell response showed converging IGHV3-driven BCR clusters closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Clonality and skewing of TCR repertoires was associated with interferon type I and III responses, early CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation and counterregulation by the coreceptors BTLA, Tim-3, PD-1, TIGIT and CD73. Tfh, Th17-like and nonconventional (but not classical anti-viral) Th1 cell polarizations were induced. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses were driven by TCR clusters shared between patients with a characteristic trajectory of clonotypes and traceability over the disease course.

Anchored in economic and network sociology, the approach has been enriched by contributions from management sciences and geomatics, which have made it possible to conceptualise a city’s supply system as a network that is both social and spatialised, structured by operators and circulating differentiated products. Tested in the city of Montpellier, a signatory of the Milan Pact, this research was based on the production of primary data from a variety of sellers and suppliers. While confirming the complementarity between short and long supply chains, the results show more broadly how the articulation of three spatialised markets favours the resilience of the city’s supply, even if it is also a source of vulnerability. Therefore, these results make an original contribution to the intersection of research on the resilience of urban supply and on coexistence in food systems, while also calling for further research.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7475729/;7/9/2020;economic and network sociology;0.9079

Owing to the poor outcome and high contagiousness of COVID-19, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of COVID-19-positive patients is still questionable. MAIN BODY: It is imperative for the healthcare workers to follow the precautions during CPR of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In the present article, we have compiled the resuscitation guidelines subjected to the availability of resources in India/developing nations. CONCLUSION: Compression-only CPR should be initiated whether cardiac arrest is of presumed hypoxic or cardiac etiology. If a patient with an unknown status/suspected/confirmed COVID-19 has out of the hospital cardiac arrest, hands-only CPR could be performed only after covering the mouth and nose of the patient and healthcare worker with the face mask or cloth. During in-hospital cardiac arrest, patients should be shifted to a negative pressure ventilation room, and healthcare worker should wear personal protective equipments.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7968557/;17/3/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9515

1218;Laparoscopic gastrectomy for heart failure patients with left ventricular assist devices.;10.1111/ases.12821;Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) currently play an important role in the treatment of patients with end-stage heart failure who require a bridge to heart transplantation. As the LVAD population increases, the incidence of cancer patients with an LVAD is assumed to be increasing as well. For gastric cancer patients with an LVAD, surgery may be the only curative treatment, especially as chemotherapy is scarcely available. However, we cannot perform an upper-middle incision in these patients because of the LVAD's location and driveline. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of driveline infection, minimally invasive surgery is desirable. Therefore, laparoscopic surgery is, where possible, suitable for achieving a secure approach to the abdominal cavity. However, laparoscopic surgery for patients with LVAD requires careful consideration not only for anesthetic management, but also for the technical procedure. We ingenuously performed laparoscopic gastrectomy for a gastric cancer patient with LVAD to preserve the device and obtain a good surgical view.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32567244/";21/6/2020;Left ventricular assist devices;0.9754
1219;Novel NGS Pipeline for Virus Discovery from a Wide Spectrum of Hosts and Sample Types;10.1101/2020.05.07.082107;The study of the microbiome data holds great potential for elucidating the biological and metabolic functioning of living organisms and their role in the environment. Metagenomic analyses have shown that humans, along with e.g. domestic animals, wildlife and arthropods, are colonized by an immense community of viruses. The current Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) heightens the need to rapidly detect previously unknown viruses in an unbiased way. The increasing availability of metagenomic data in this era of next-generation sequencing (NGS), along with increasingly affordable sequencing technologies, highlight the need for reliable and comprehensive methods to manage such data. In this article, we present a novel stand-alone pipeline called LAZYPIPE for identifying both previously known and novel viruses in host-associated or environmental samples and give examples of virus discovery based on it. LAZYPIPE is a Unix-based pipeline for automated assembling and taxonomic profiling of NGS libraries implemented as a collection of C++, Perl, and R scripts.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.082107;8/5/2020;Coronavirus pandemic;0.9755

Risk factors include septicemia, dehydration, polycythemia, maternal diabetes, asphyxia, and inherited thrombophilias. They present with cyanosis and respiratory distress. Careful echocardiogram assessment helps in identifying the thrombus in the pulmonary artery and its branches. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography confirms the diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of term neonate who presented with respiratory distress and cyanosis and a detailed echocardiogram revealed thrombus in the origin of left pulmonary artery. The neonate was managed initially with unfractionated heparin and later with low molecular weight heparin with which there was significant resolution of the thrombus CONCLUSION: Spontaneous pulmonary artery thrombosis though rare should be suspected in any cyanotic neonate with respiratory distress.

Fifty out of the feedbacks from the online interview were picked randomly to arrive at the conclusion of this study. The feedbacks suggested that there is adequate awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic among the people living in Lagos Metropolis, Nigeria and that they are following the directives of federal and state governments in an effort to reduce the community transmission of the infectious diseases. However, the ban on public gatherings and movements has made it impossible for many homes to meet their basic needs especially feeding. The government provided palliatives have also been largely insufficient to cater for the vulnerable.

1223;Targeted Cellular Micropharmacies: Cells Engineered for Localized Drug Delivery.;10.3390/cancers12082175;The recent emergence of engineered cellular therapies, such as Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) CAR T and T cell receptor (TCR) engineered T cells, has shown great promise in the treatment of various cancers. These agents aggregate and expand exponentially at the tumor site, resulting in potent immune activation and tumor clearance. Moreover, the ability to elaborate these cells with therapeutic agents, such as antibodies, enzymes, and immunostimulatory molecules, presents an unprecedented opportunity to specifically modulate the tumor microenvironment through cell-mediated drug delivery. This unique pharmacology, combined with significant advances in synthetic biology and cell engineering, has established a new paradigm for cells as vectors for drug delivery. Targeted cellular micropharmacies (TCMs) are a revolutionary new class of living drugs, which we envision will play an important role in cancer medicine and beyond.

Of the 1,700 healthcare providers approached, 433 completed questionnaires could be used. The results show that the pandemic has had a profound impact on both the accessibility of oral healthcare and on care provided in oral healthcare practices. Extra attention was paid to hygiene and infection prevention: the types of personal protective equipment and the protocols and procedures were adjusted by many oral healthcare providers. The confirmed prevalence of oral healthcare providers with COVID-19 in this study was 1.6%. However, testing was not available to all respondents with complaints during this initial period. Over half of the respondents estimated that even with additional measures there is an increased risk of infection to oral healthcare providers during their work.

Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.26.20018754;28/1/2020;coronavirus;0.9728

However, the world is not currently prepared to deal with the growing burden of COVID-19, with the unexpected arrival of Hantavirus infection heading to the next several healthcare emergencies in public. Hantavirus is a significant class of zoonotic pathogens of negative-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA). Hemorrhagic renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) are the two major clinical manifestations. Till date, there is no effective treatments or vaccines available, public awareness and precautionary measures can help to reduce the spread of hantavirus disease. In this study, we outline the epidemiology, virology, clinical aspects, and existing HFRS and HCPS management approaches.

Therefore, the individuals who are reluctant to be vaccinated or forego COVID-19 vaccination can delay the progress of overall vaccination coverage, leading to slower vaccination rates and may create obstacles in global efforts to control the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 as unvaccinated individuals can act as reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and could drive further outbreaks. Vaccine hesitancy is one of the major threats that directly impact global health as it challenges our ability to eradicate infectious diseases and achieve significant herd immunity through vaccination. One of the strategies to counter vaccine hesitancy is to follow a multisectoral approach that involves the collaboration between various stakeholders, such as government, private companies, religious groups, and other agencies, to leverage the knowledge, expertise, and resources, thereby enabling the creation of longstanding public trust of vaccines.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1926183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191680/";30/6/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9594

The clotting cascade is propagated by a series of proteases, including factor Xa and thrombin. Other host proteases, including TMPRSS2, are recognized to be important for cleavage activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike to promote viral entry. Using biochemical and cell-based assays, we demonstrate that factor Xa and thrombin can also directly cleave SARS-CoV-2 spike, enhancing viral entry. A drug-repurposing screen identified a subset of protease inhibitors that promiscuously inhibited spike cleavage by both transmembrane serine proteases as well as coagulation factors. The mechanism of the protease inhibitors nafamostat and camostat extend beyond inhibition of TMPRSS2 to coagulation-induced spike cleavage. Anticoagulation is critical in the management of COVID-19, and early intervention could provide collateral benefit by suppressing SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. We propose a model of positive feedback whereby infection-induced hypercoagulation exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821268/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.31.437960";1/4/2021;Coagulopathy;0.9204

Various interrelations link these private and public projects. Contrary to the original intentions, Bitcoin has not developed into a widespread means of payments, not the least due to its considerable price volatility. Its most significant contribution could be the „proof of concept“ for an innovative, private means of payment outside the conventional monetary system. In contrast, Libra is designed as a rather conventional means of payment with close relations with the existing banking sector, which raises numerous policy questions concerning monetary and financial stability. Central bank digital currencies could be viewed as a public sector response to these private projects to secure central banks’ predominant role in the monetary system of the future.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7560782/;25/9/2020;central bank digital currencies;0.9811

Atherosclerosis is responsible for the majority of cardiovascular disorders with inflammation as one of its driving processes. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, responsible for the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-18 (IL-18), has been studied extensively and showed to play a pivotal role in the progression of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. Both the NLRP3 inflammasome and its downstream cytokines, IL-1ß and IL-18, could therefore be promising targets in cardiovascular disease. This review summarizes the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in atherosclerosis, CAD, and myocardial I/R injury. Furthermore, the current therapeutic approaches targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its downstream signaling cascade in atherosclerosis, CAD, and myocardial I/R injury are discussed.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12265-020-10049-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648087/";9/7/2020;coronary artery disease;0.9817

The management of the disease is mostly supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death in a significant proportion of affected patients. Preliminary data point out that dramatic increase in IL-6 and subsequent cytokine release syndrome may account for the development of fatal interstitial pneumonia. Inhibition of IL-6 by blocking its specific receptor with monoclonal antibodies has been advocated as a promising attempt. Here we assess the potential utility of myo-Inositol, a polyol already in use for treating the newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome, in downregulating the inflammatory response upon Sars-CoV-2 infection. Myo-Inositol proved to reduce IL-6 levels in a number of conditions and to mitigate the inflammatory cascade, while being devoid of any significant side effects.

This is a natural consequence of the link between geography and the navigational complexity, but moving the ship to a new area or changing owners may require a costly re-approval. The automotive industry has introduced the Operational Design Domain (ODD) that can be used as a basis for approval. However, the ODD does not include the human control responsibilities, while most autonomous ship systems are expected to be dependent on sharing control responsibilities between humans and automation. We propose the definition of an operational envelope for autonomous ship systems that include the sharing of responsibilities between human and automation, and that is general enough to allow approval of autonomous ship systems in all geographic areas and operations that falls within the envelope. We also show how the operational envelope can be defined using a system modelling language, such as the unified modelling language (UML).;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935379/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00773-021-00815-z";24/4/2021;Operational Design Domain;0.9766
1236;The new frontier of consumer experiences: escape through pain;10.1007/s13162-020-00175-8;Terms such as consumer experience and experiential consumption have become ubiquitous in the realm of marketing. The last decades have seen a dramatic increase in academic publications exploring these concepts across many different streams and have resulted in significant advances in scholarly understanding. Consumer culture theory (CCT) scholars have particularly participated in this effort by investigating extraordinary experiences and framing them as escapes from everyday life. This paper proposes a summary of CCT contributions on extraordinary experiences and emphasizes the way these works have used the structural/anti-structural coexistence theory to depict the experiences consumers live through. Then it mobilizes a fiction to improve the understanding of escape. This paper highlights how painful leisure pursuits enable consumers to reconnect with their bodies, affording them moments of escape from an otherwise saturated self. The paper shows how the concept of self-escape is important to envision the possibilities in marketing painful experiences.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7264963/;2/6/2020;Consumer culture theory;0.9043

These populations are more at risk of contracting COVID-19 as they often find it difficult to adhere to public health directives and, if exposed, may be more susceptible to illness or death due to the higher prevalence of underlying physical and mental comorbidities compared to the general population. In addition, vulnerable populations may have limited access to essential diagnostics and treatments, thus leading to untreated COVID-19 cases and their development into more severe forms. Health, social and government agencies should collaborate to develop services that support these communities, in accordance with the World Health Organization principles. Migrant and homeless centers have a central role, as they provide a significant contribution to prevent infection spread and favor access to early medical treatment to those affected, thus preventing more severe forms of infection.;"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202009_23071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015824/";1/9/2020;Coronavirus Disease 19;0.9574

Many people have suffered from symptoms like COVID-19 during this pandemic, and some people have cured without taking any treatment or taking minor pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. However, they might be spreading their infections among their family members and perhaps in the community. It is unsure that individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms are positive with COVID-19, but our concern is, during this pandemic, any types of symptoms such as flu-like symptoms should have been taken seriously. This study was observed in the cases from three families with COVID-19 like symptoms. Case presentation This observational study was done between May 20 and Jun 2, 2020, in Bangladesh. The members of the inspected families shared COVID-19 like symptoms that were lasted for 3-10 days.

Deep learning-based methods have been demonstrated powerful on predicting RBP sites on RNAs. However, the training of deep learning models is very time-intensive and computationally intensive. RESULTS: Here we present a deep learning-based RBPsuite, an easy-to-use webserver for predicting RBP binding sites on linear and circular RNAs. For linear RNAs, RBPsuite predicts the RBP binding scores with them using our updated iDeepS. For circular RNAs (circRNAs), RBPsuite predicts the RBP binding scores with them using our developed CRIP. RBPsuite first breaks the input RNA sequence into segments of 101 nucleotides and scores the interaction between the segments and the RBPs. RBPsuite further detects the verified motifs on the binding segments gives the binding scores distribution along the full-length sequence.

The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino acid fragment of the 1273-amino acid S-protein protomer. Antibodies to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a closely related coronavirus which emerged in 2002-2003, have been shown to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1 S-protein-mediated entry, and the presence of anti-RBD antibodies correlates with neutralization in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. Here we show that immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits a robust neutralizing antibody response in rodents, comparable to 100 µg/ml of ACE2-Ig, a potent SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor. Importantly, anti-sera from immunized animals did not mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of S-protein-mediated entry under conditions in which Zika virus ADE was readily observed. These data suggest that an RBD-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 could be safe and effective.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036418;11/4/2020;receptor-binding domain;0.9723

1246;Determining the source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthcare worker;10.1101/2020.04.27.20077016;Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic and are at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection from their interactions with patients and in the community. Limited availability of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), in particular N95 respirators, has fueled concerns about whether HCWs are adequately protected from exposure while caring for patients. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a HCW - the community or the healthcare system - is critical for understanding the effectiveness of hospital infection control and PPE practices. In Dane County, Wisconsin, community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low (cumulative prevalence of ~0.06% - positive cases / total population in Dane county as of April 17). Although SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCWs are often presumed to be acquired during the course of patient care, there are few reports unambiguously identifying the source of acquisition.

To date, several scientific publications have revealed a concentration of up to 60% of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in such institutions. Most LTFC residents share the primary risk factors currently associated with increased morbimortality due to the COVID-19 infection. It is crucial to define actions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread in this environment, besides the usual measures of social distancing and isolation of the carriers of this disease. This paper proposes strategies for the investigation of this infection in LTCF residents and workers using laboratory tests available in Brazil.

Based on high-resolution structures, the two viruses bind in practically identical conformations, although several residues of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) differ between them. Here we have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, machine learning (ML), and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to elucidate the differences in RBD binding by the two viruses. Although only subtle differences were observed from the initial MD simulations of the two RBD-ACE2 complexes, ML identified the individual residues with the most distinctive ACE2 interactions, many of which have been highlighted in previous experimental studies. FEP calculations quantified the corresponding differences in binding free energies to ACE2, and examination of MD trajectories provided structural explanations for these differences. Lastly, the energetics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations were studied, showing that the affinity of the RBD for ACE2 is increased by N501Y and E484K mutations but is slightly decreased by K417N.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.436231;21/3/2021;receptor-binding domain;0.9888

We found a strong gradient between neighbourhood income and physical distancing. Individuals in high-income neighbourhoods increased their days at home substantially more than individuals in low-income neighbourhoods did. Residents of low-income neighbourhoods were more likely to work outside the home, compared to residents in higher-income neighbourhoods, but were not more likely to visit locations such as supermarkets, parks and hospitals. Finally, we found that state orders were only associated with small increases in staying home in low-income neighbourhoods.

The authors utilized flow cytometry to analyze circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both patient-cohorts maintained B and T cell phenotypes consistent with activation and cellular exhaustion throughout the first two months of infection. Additionally, follow-up samples from the non-hospitalized patient cohort showed that activation markers and cellular exhaustion increased over time. These findings illustrate the persistent nature of the adaptive immune system changes that have been noted in COVID-19 and suggest longer-term effects that may shape the maintenance of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.;"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci143928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33104057/";26/10/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9243

Therefore, here, we aimed to evaluate AEs and early NAb production in relatively healthy Asians who received the ChAdOx1 vaccine and determine the effect of AEs and antipyretics on early NAb production against COVID-19. Of the 182 Korean HCWs who received the first dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine, 172 (94.5%) experienced ≥1 adverse events and 148 (81.3%) tested positive for NAb 33-40 days after the vaccination.

A potential link with inflammatory response;10.1101/2020.03.26.009605;The disease known as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), potentially caused by an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, has hit the world hard, and has led to an unprecedent health and economic crisis. In order to develop treatment options able to stop or ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 effects, we need to understand the biology of the virus inside cells, but this kind of studies are still scarce. A recent study investigated translatome and proteome host cell changes induced in vitro by SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we use the publicly available proteomics data from this study to re-analyze the mechanisms altered by the virus infection by impact pathways analysis and network analysis. Proteins linked to inflammatory response, but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mitosis, were found to be regulated. The up-regulation of the inflammatory-related proteins observed could be linked to the propagation of inflammatory reaction and lung injury that is observed in advanced stages of COVID-19 patients.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009605;28/3/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9739

1267;Enhanced secondary pollution offset reduction of primary emissions during COVID-19 lockdown in China;10.1093/nsr/nwaa137;To control the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), China imposed nationwide restrictions on the movement of its population (lockdown) after the Chinese New Year of 2020, leading to large reductions in economic activities and associated emissions. Despite such large decreases in primary pollution, there were nonetheless several periods of heavy haze pollution in East China, raising questions about the well-established relationship between human activities and air quality. Here, using comprehensive measurements and modeling, we show the haze during the COVID lockdown were driven by enhancements of secondary pollution. In particular, large decreases in NO(x) emissions from transportation increased ozone and nighttime NO(3) radical formation, and these increases in atmospheric oxidizing capacity in turn facilitated the formation of secondary particulate matter. Our results, afforded by the tragic natural experiment of the COVID-19 pandemic, indicate that haze mitigation depends upon a coordinated and balanced strategy for controlling multiple pollutants.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7337733/;18/6/2020;coronavirus;0.9419

Genomic analyses show SARS‐CoV‐2 likely to be chimeric, most of its sequence closest to bat CoV RaTG13, whereas its receptor binding domain (RBD) is almost identical to that of a pangolin CoV. Chimeric viruses can arise via natural recombination or human intervention. The furin cleavage site in the spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 confers to the virus the ability to cross species and tissue barriers, but was previously unseen in other SARS‐like CoVs. Might genetic manipulations have been performed in order to evaluate pangolins as possible intermediate hosts for bat‐derived CoVs that were originally unable to bind to human receptors? Both cleavage site and specific RBD could result from site‐directed mutagenesis, a procedure that does not leave a trace. Considering the devastating impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 and importance of preventing future pandemics, researchers have a responsibility to carry out a thorough analysis of all possible SARS‐CoV‐2 origins.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200842/; https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.202000240";17/11/2020;receptor binding domain;0.9581

Therefore, IFD continue to be a public health threat and a major hindrance to the success of otherwise life-saving treatments and procedures. Globally, hundreds of thousands of people are affected every year with Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jirovecii, endemic dimorphic fungi and Mucormycetes, the most common fungal species causing invasive diseases in humans. These infections result in morbidity and mortality rates that are unacceptable and represent a considerable socioeconomic burden.

The amounts of these compounds used in household, workplace, and industry settings has very likely increased, and usage will continue to be elevated given the scope of the pandemic. QACs have been previously detected in wastewater, surface waters, and sediments, and effects on antibiotic resistance have been explored. Thus, it is important to assess potential environmental and engineering impacts of elevated QAC usage, which may include disruption of wastewater treatment unit operations, proliferation of antibiotic resistance, formation of nitrosamine disinfection byproducts, and impacts on biota in surface waters. The threat caused by COVID-19 is clear, and a reasonable response is elevated use of QACs to mitigate spread of infection. Exploration of potential effects, environmental fate, and technologies to minimize environmental releases of QACs, however, is warranted.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341688/;26/6/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9191

Children and adolescents who already live with a mental illness may be particularly vulnerable to the distress associated with the pandemic – due to, for example, fear of the virus as well as the significant societal changes launched to minimize spread of the virus (social distancing and quarantine). In this editorial perspective, we (a) provide data on COVID‐19 pandemic‐related psychopathology in children and adolescents from a large psychiatric treatment setting in Denmark, (b) give advice on how the likely harmful effects of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents may be minimized, and (c) propose six lines of research into pandemic‐related psychopathology with emphasis on children and adolescents.

On the basis of this issue, neurologists are very concerned about patients with neurological disorders, especially multiple sclerosis (MS), as consumers of immunosuppressive or immune‐modulating drugs. Therefore, the administration of proper disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS patients is critical during the pandemic status. On the one hand, both the autoimmune diseases and immunosuppressive drugs increase the risk of infection due to impairment in the immune system, and on the other hand, postponing of MS treatment has serious consequences on the central nervous system. In the present study, we discussed recent literature about the effect of DMTs administration on the severity of COVID‐19 in the MS patients. Overall, it seems that DMTs do not provoke the COVID‐19 infection in the MS patients by declining immune responses and cytokine storm.

1276;Extensive and diverse patterns of cell death sculpt neural networks in insects;10.7554/elife.59566;Changes to the structure and function of neural networks are thought to underlie the evolutionary adaptation of animal behaviours. Among the many developmental phenomena that generate change programmed cell death (PCD) appears to play a key role. We show that cell death occurs continuously throughout insect neurogenesis and happens soon after neurons are born. Mimicking an evolutionary role for increasing cell numbers, we artificially block PCD in the medial neuroblast lineage in Drosophila melanogaster, which results in the production of ‘undead’ neurons with complex arborisations and distinct neurotransmitter identities. Activation of these ‘undead’ neurons and recordings of neural activity in behaving animals demonstrate that they are functional. Focusing on two dipterans which have lost flight during evolution we reveal that reductions in populations of flight interneurons are likely caused by increased cell death during development. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary modulation of death-based patterning could generate novel network configurations.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7535934/;7/9/2020;programmed cell death;0.976

1278;Immunometabolic control of trained immunity;10.1016/j.mam.2020.100897;Innate immune cells can adopt long-term inflammatory phenotypes following brief encounters with exogenous (microbial) or endogenous stimuli. This phenomenon is named trained immunity and can improve host defense against (recurrent) infections. In contrast, trained immunity can also be maladaptive in the context of chronic inflammatory disorders, such as atherosclerosis. Key to future therapeutic exploitation of this mechanism is thorough knowledge of the mechanisms driving trained immunity, which can be used as pharmacological targets. These mechanisms include profound changes in intracellular metabolism, which are closely intertwined with epigenetic reprogramming at the level of histone modifications. Glycolysis, glutamine replenishment of the tricarboxylic acid cycle with accumulation of fumarate, and the mevalonate pathway have all been identified as critical pathways for trained immunity in monocytes and macrophages. In this review, we provide a state-of-the-art overview of how these metabolic pathways interact with epigenetic programs to develop trained immunity.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098299720300716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32891423/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0098299720300716; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mam.2020.100897";2/9/2020;trained immunity;0.9237

Nucleic acid testing is the standard method for the diagnosis of viral infections. However, this method reportedly has a low positivity rate. To increase the sensitivity of COVID‐19 diagnoses, we developed an IgM‐IgG combined assay and tested it in patients with suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In total, 56 patients were enrolled in this study and SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected by using both IgM‐IgG antibody and nucleic acid tests. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Our findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response.

As such, certain groups are suggested to be prioritized for vaccination to protect the most vulnerable before vaccinating others. Our model suggests an allocation of vaccines such that COVID-19 deaths are minimized while the prioritization framework is satisfied. Results of the model show that a vaccine coverage of at least 50 to 70% of the population can be enough for a community with limited supplies, and an increase in vaccine supply is beneficial if initial coverage is less than the specified target range. Also, among the vaccines considered in the study, the one with 89.9% effectiveness and has a 183 Philippine peso (Php) price per dose projected the least number of deaths.

While policymakers have attempted to balance the health and economic impacts of the pandemic, decentralized decision-making, deep uncertainty, and the lack of widespread use of comprehensive decision support methods can lead to the choice of fragile or inefficient strategies. This paper uses simulation models and the Robust Decision Making (RDM) approach to stress-test California's reopening strategy and other alternatives over a wide range of futures. We find that plans which respond aggressively to initial outbreaks are required to robustly control the pandemic. Further, the best plans adapt to changing circumstances, lowering their stringent requirements to reopen over time or as more constituents are vaccinated.

Proteomic, interactome, and transcriptomic analyses, combined with bioinformatic analysis, revealed that expression of only this highly unstable small viral protein impaired interferon signaling, antigen presentation, and complement signaling, while inducing IL-6 signaling. Furthermore, we showed that interfering with ORF9c degradation by either proteasome inhibition or inhibition of the ATPase VCP blunted the effects of ORF9c. Our study indicated that ORF9c enables immune evasion and coordinates cellular changes essential for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

1289;Chaos ruined the children’s sleep, diet and behaviour: Gendered discourses on family life in pandemic times;10.1111/gwao.12519;This study adopts a feminist critical approach to explore how parenting was understood during the COVID‐19 restrictive measures in Iceland. Iceland has been known as a front runner in gender equality, and women’s participation in the workforce is high. Data consists of 97 stories that were collected during the peak of COVID‐19 in April 2020 using the story completion method. The stories were thematically analysed. Most of the participants were university‐educated women. The themes demonstrate the power of neoliberal discourses in framing parenting. Parenting during a pandemic, especially mothering, is constructed as an overwhelming project that requires detailed organization and management. There is also resistance to neoliberal governmentality through redefining successful parenthood. Furthermore, the gendered nature of domestic work is questioned, especially the traditional, inactive father who prioritizes his own needs only to fail comically in the domestic sphere. The study contributes to our understanding of gendered parenthood in neoliberal, pandemic times.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837027/";17/8/2020;restrictive measures;0.9198
1290;The impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on expatriates: A pathway to work‐life harmony?;10.1002/joe.22088;International assignments tend to be a turbulent time for expatriates, as they bring about changes in the two main spheres of their lives: personal and work. Although work‐life interface is a challenge among expatriates it can also be a work‐life harmony. Here, we present the findings of how expatriates work‐day life changed while performing overseas tasks during the coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic and analyze how this new status quo may influence future expatriates' expectations regarding their work‐life interface. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 12 expatriates. Results show that although since the beginning of the quarantine, personal life is interfering in work, causing work‐life conflict, the role of the expatriates' family positively impacted their work‐life balance, and harmony. We suggest some recommendations to human resource managers and conclude that the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on expatriates can be a pathway to work‐life harmony, where work and life are seen as an integrative domain, rather than competing ones.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8206922/;27/4/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9646
1291;MDRO transmission in acute hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.;10.1097/qco.0000000000000735;PURPOSE OF REVIEW The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in necessary modifications of infection control policies and practices in acute healthcare facilities globally. This is often accompanied by infrastructure modifications, ward redesignations, as well as healthcare staff redeployments and changes to infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. We review the potential for both negative and positive impacts these major changes can have on nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). RECENT FINDINGS Healthcare facilities around the world have report outbreaks of MDROs during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast some centres have reported a decrease in baseline rates due to a number of possible factors. SUMMARY While implementing crucial preventive measures for COVID-19, is it important to consider any collateral effects of changes in IPC and antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) practices. The disruption caused to IPC and ASP practices during the pandemic are likely to see a counter intuitive increase in transmission of MDROs.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34010232/";19/5/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9542

DPP-4 is membrane anchored but it can be cleaved by numerous proteases including matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs). DPP-4 is expressed by endothelial and epithelial cells, the kidney, intestine and cells of the immune system; it has a broad spectrum of biological functions in immune regulation, cancer biology and glucose metabolism.Areas covered: This article sheds light on the functions of DPP-4, the molecular mechanisms that govern its expression, it's role in the pathogenesis of common respiratory illnesses and potential as a therapeutic target.Expert opinion: DPP-4 has a deleterious role in respiratory disease. Its biological functions, key molecular pathways, interactions and associations are slowly being elucidated. Progressing our knowledge of the role of this multi-faceted molecule may yield vital and novel therapies for respiratory diseases such as lung cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).";"https://doi.org/10.1080/14728222.2020.1721468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31971463/";23/1/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9615
1293;Prevent or Cure - The Unprecedented Need for Self-Reporting Materials.;10.1002/anie.202012592;Self-reporting smart materials are highly relevant in modern soft matter materials science, as they allow for the autonomous detection of changes in synthetic polymers, materials and composites. Despite critical advantages of such materials, e.g. prolonged lifetime or prevention of disastrous material failures, they have gained much less attention than self-healing materials. However, as diagnosis is critical for any therapy, it is of the utmost importance to report the existence of system changes and their exact location to prevent them from spreading. Thus, we herein critically review the chemistry of self-reporting soft matter materials systems and highlight how current challenges and limitations may be overcome by successfully transferring self-reporting research concepts from the laboratory to the real world. Especially in the space of diagnostic self-reporting systems, the recent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic indicates an urgent need for such concepts that may be able to detect the presence of viruses or bacteria on and within materials in a self-reporting fashion.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202012592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217121/";20/11/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9562

1295;A Review of Pathogen Transmission at the Backyard Chicken–Wild Bird Interface;10.3389/fvets.2020.539925;Habitat conversion and the expansion of domesticated, invasive species into native habitats are increasingly recognized as drivers of pathogen emergence at the agricultural–wildlife interface. Poultry agriculture is one of the largest subsets of this interface, and pathogen spillover events between backyard chickens and wild birds are becoming more commonly reported. Native wild bird species are under numerous anthropogenic pressures, but the risks of pathogen spillover from domestic chickens have been historically underappreciated as a threat to wild birds. Now that the backyard chicken industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the world, it is imperative that the principles of biosecurity, specifically bioexclusion and biocontainment, are legislated and implemented. We reviewed the literature on spillover events of pathogens historically associated with poultry into wild birds. We also reviewed the reasons for biosecurity failures in backyard flocks that lead to those spillover events and provide recommendations for current and future backyard flock owners.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33195512/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.539925";24/9/2020;Poultry agriculture;0.9026

This association was most notable in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis (an indirect, vascular-targeted mechanism of lung injury) and persisted in patients who lacked epithelial expression of the A antigen, suggesting an endothelial mechanism of A1-associated ARDS susceptibility. Critically-ill patients with blood type A had increased circulating concentrations of endothelial-derived glycoproteins von Willebrand Factor and soluble thrombomodulin, and marginal lungs from blood type A donors were less likely to recover function during ex vivo perfusion.

The current study aims to evaluate how mitigating interventions affected the epidemic process in the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the US and whether temperature played a role in the epidemic process. Methods: Publicly available COVID-19 cases and deaths data and weather data were analyzed at the metropolitan level. The time-varying reproductive numbers were used to explore the trends. Results: We found that virus transmissibility, measured by instantaneous reproduction number (Rt), had declined significantly since the end of March for all areas and almost all of them reached a Rt of 1 or below by April 15, 2020. Cities with warm temperature tended to have a lower peak Rt than that of cities with cold temperature. However, large geographic variations exist.

Nonsense mutations are responsible for the presence of a premature termination codon (PTC) in the mRNA, creating a lack of functional protein. In this context, translational readthrough-inducing drugs (TRIDs) represent a promising approach to correct the basic defect caused by PTCs. By using computational optimization and biological screening, we identified three new small molecules showing high readthrough activity. The activity of these compounds has been verified by evaluating CFTR expression and functionality after treatment with the selected molecules in cells expressing nonsense-CFTR-mRNA. Additionally, the channel functionality was measured by the halide sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) quenching assay.

A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse.

HIV in the Rust Belt (directed by Holly Hey) documents some of the experiences of local HIV survivors. During the course of filming, however, a story emerged about the importance of an AIDS facility, David's House Compassion, which had served as a hospice and a resource centre between 1988 to 2003. When COVID-19 arrived in the USA, we were mid-way through filming. Doing this work during the COVID-19 pandemic opened up a host of questions about the porousness of bodies as well as the slippage of time and stigma between the two pandemics. As we continued filming, we were made more aware that the story of David's House Compassion could be just as much as story of COVID-19, representative of antiprophylactic citizenship, an idea of belonging that comes from an openness and vulnerability that only sickness can offer.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/13691058.2021.1919316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33950793/";5/5/2021;representative of antiprophylactic citizenship;0.9099

In particular, it includes a novel policy to capture the R0 response in the virus spreading over time. The model estimates the vulnerability of the pandemic with a prediction of new cases by estimating a time-varying R0 to capture changes in the behavior of SIR model implies to new policy taken at different times and different locations of the world. This modified SIR model with the different values of R0 can be applied to different country scenario using the real time data report provided by the authorities during this pandemic.

1314;COVID-19 in Neonates: A Call for Standardized Testing;10.1007/s13312-020-2073-6;The limited evidence on neonatal Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests that vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rare, and most neonates seem to acquire the infection postnatally through respiratory droplets and contact. Testing of neonates with perinatal or postnatal exposure to COVID-19 infection plays a vital role in the early diagnosis, management and institution of infection prevention measures thereby cutting off the chain of epidemic transmission. A recently concluded online neonatal COVID-19 conference conducted by the National Neonatology Forum (NNF) of India and a nationwide online survey pointed to substantial variation in neonatal testing strategies. We, herein, summarize the relevant literature about the incidence and outcomes of neonatal COVID-19 and call for a universal and uniform testing strategy for exposed neonates. We anticipate that the testing strategy put forth in this article will facilitate better management and safe infection prevention measures among all units offering neonatal care in the country.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781820/;24/10/2020;neonatal Coronavirus disease;0.9873

It is particularly important to predict the trend of the epidemic for the timely adjustment of the economy and industries. We proposed a Flow-SEHIR model in this paper, based on which we further analyzed the trends of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) in China. The results show that the basic reproductive numbers R0 of COVID-19 is 3.56 (95% CI: 2.31-4.81). The number of daily confirmed new cases reaches the inflection point on Feb. 6-10 outside Hubei. For the maximum of infected cases number, the predicted peak value in China except Hubei was estimated to be 13806 (95% CI: 11926-15845). The peak arrival time is on March 3-9. The temporal number of patients in most areas of China outside Hubei will peak from March 12 to March 15. The peak values of more than 73.5% provinces or regions in China will be controlled within 1000. According to Flow-SEHIR model and estimations from the data of evacuation of nationals from Wuhan, the peak cumulative number of patients in Hubei was estimated to be 403481 (95% CI: 143284-1166936).;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021444;11/2/2020;2019-nCoV;0.9371

The aim of this study is to identify the COVID-19 cases (positive, recovery and death) in Algeria using the Double Exponential Smoothing Method and an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for forecasting the COVID-19 cases. The data for this study were obtained from March 21st, 2020 to November 26th, 2020. The daily Algerian COVID-19 confirmed cases were sourced from The Ministry of Health, Population and Hospital Reform of Algeria. Based on the results of PACF, ACF, and estimated parameters of the ARIMA model in the COVID-19 case in Algeria following the ARIMA model (0,1,1). Observed cases during the forecast period were accurately predicted and were placed within the prediction intervals generated by the fitted model.

Outcomes have historically been poor for the vast majority of patients who lack a matched sibling donor. However, the development of haploidentical HCT (haplo-HCT) with high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has allowed for curative long-term potential with favorable transplant-related outcomes, though this has not obviated the potential for graft rejection from human leukocyte antigen mismatch and repeated red blood cell transfusions. Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012. Presently, we aim to discuss results from pertinent studies and compare outcomes with the two most recent approaches involving either thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation or 400-cGy total body irradiation.

There remains an urgent need to understand its transmission characteristics and design effective interventions to mitigate its spread. In this study, we define a non-linear (known in biochemistry models as allosteric or cooperative) relationship between viral shedding, viral dose and COVID-19 infection propagation. We develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of COVID-19 to link quantitative features of viral shedding, human exposure and transmission in nine countries impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The model was then used to evaluate the efficacy of interventions against virus transmission. We found that cooperativity was important to capture country-specific transmission dynamics and leads to resistance to mitigating transmission in mild or moderate interventions. The behaviors of the model emphasize that strict interventions greatly limiting both virus shedding and human exposure are indispensable to achieving effective containment of COVID-19.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511475/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.05.20092361v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.20092361";7/5/2020;coronavirus;0.9263

We confirmed that SREBP-2-induced cholesterol biosynthesis was suppressed by Sestrin-1 and PCSK9 expression, while the SREBP-2-induced inflammatory responses was upregulated in COVID-19 ICU patients. Using an infectious disease mouse model, inhibitors of SREBP-2 and NF-κB suppressed cytokine storms caused by viral infection and prevented pulmonary damages.

As the major supply of capital, financial service providers (FSPs) play a critical role in financing SMEs. However, how FSPs deal with SME financing during shocks has not yet been fully researched. Accordingly, in this study, a theoretical framework based on expectancy theory is proposed to explore the expected strategic adjustments of FSPs in financing SMEs. Specifically, this study investigates 272 FSPs in China on their expectancy and attitude on financing to SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, this study has divided FSPs into three categories: commercial banks, non-bank financial institutions, and credit-enhanced FSPs. Differences among these categories are compared and analyzed.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753105/;22/12/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9799
1335;Genetic risk factors for death with SARS-CoV-2 from the UK Biobank;10.1101/2020.07.01.20144592;We present here genetic risk factors for survivability from infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). At the time of writing it is too early to determine comprehensively and without doubt all risk factors, but there is an urgency due to the global pandemic crisis that merits this early analysis. We have nonetheless discovered 5 novel risk variants in 4 genes, discovered by examining 193 deaths from 1,412 confirmed infections in a group of 5,871 UK Biobank participants tested for the virus. We also examine the distribution of these genetic variants across broad ethnic groups and compare it to data from the UK Office of National Statistics for increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2. We confidently identify the gene ERAP2 with a high-risk variant, as well as three other genes of potential interest. Although mostly rare, a common theme of genetic risk factors affecting survival might be the inability to launch or modulate an effective immune and stress response to infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.01.20144592; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.01.20144592v1?rss=1";5/7/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9655

Owing to basic transformation containing an extra parameter, every existing lifetime model can be made more flexible with suggested development. Some specific statistical attributes of the GLET-GTII are investigated, such as quantiles, uncertainty measures, survival function, moments, reliability, and hazard function etc. We describe two methods of parametric estimations of GLET-GTII discussed by using maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian paradigm. The Monte Carlo simulation analysis shows that estimators are consistent. Two real life implementations are performed to scrutinize the suitability of our current strategy. These real life data is related to Infectious diseases (COVID-19). These applications identify that by using the current approach, our proposed model outperforms than other well known existing models available in the literature.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379720321616; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2020.103747; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211379720321616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520628/";29/12/2020;Infectious diseases;0.9932

Here, we describe the case of a 3.5-year-old girl with an unusually severe presentation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The child had an autoinflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, which had been treated using prednisolone and methotrexate, and her parents were half cousins of Turkish descent. After 5 days of nonspecific viral infection symptoms, tonic-clonic seizures occurred followed by acute cardiac insufficiency, multi-organ insufficiency, and ultimate death. Trio exome sequencing identified a homozygous splice-variant in the gene TBK1, and a homozygous missense variant in the gene TNFRSF13B. Heterozygous deleterious variants in the TBK1 gene have been associated with severe COVID-19, and the variant in the TNFRSF13B gene has been associated with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).

OBJECTIVE This study explored the experiences of adults with intellectual disabilities from their perspective during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, where most community-based services were suspended. METHODS We conducted in-depth interviews with 15 adults with intellectual disabilities who lost access to services during COVID-19 pandemic. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS Five overarching themes emerged: changes in (a) daily life, (b) health behaviors, (c) family relationships, (d) social relationships, and (e) social participation. Most participants experienced the loss of daily routines and healthy behaviors, family conflicts, and social isolation, but they also developed new ways of adapting and finding a new normal.

1340;Purification of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike, its receptor binding domain, and CR3022 mAb for serological assay;10.1101/2020.07.31.231282;Serology testing for COVID-19 is highly attractive because of the relatively short diagnosis time and the ability to test for an active immune response against the SARS-CoV-2. In many types of serology tests, the sensitivity and the specificity are directly influenced by the quality of the antigens manufactured. Protein purification of these recombinantly expressed viral antigens [e.g., spike and its receptor binding domain (RBD)] is an important step in the manufacturing process. Simple and high-capacity protein purification schemes for spike, RBD, and CR3022 mAb, recombinantly expressed in CHO and HEK293 cells, are reported in this article. The schemes consist of an affinity chromatography step and a desalting step. Purified proteins were validated in ELISA-based serological tests. Interestingly, extracellular matrix proteins [most notably heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)] were co-purified from spike-expressing CHO culture with a long cultivation time. HSPG-spike interaction could play a functional role in the pathology and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.231282;2/8/2020;Serology testing;0.9295

1342;Fundamental Limitations of Contact Tracing for COVID-19;10.1101/2020.12.15.20248299;Contact tracing has played a central role in COVID-19 control in many jurisdictions and is often used in conjunction with other measures such as travel restrictions and social distancing mandates. Contact tracing is made ineffective, however, by delays in testing, calling, and isolating. Even if delays are minimized, contact tracing can only prevent a fraction of onward transmissions from contacts. Without other measures in place, contact tracing alone is insufficient to prevent exponential growth in the number of cases. Even when used effectively with other measures, occasional bursts in call loads can overwhelm contact tracing systems and lead to a loss of control. We propose embracing approaches to COVID-19 control that broadly test individuals without symptoms, in whatever way is economically feasible, either with fast cheap tests that can be deployed widely, with pooled testing, or with screening of judiciously chosen groups of high-risk individuals. Only by ramping up testing of asymptomatic individuals can we avoid the inherent delays that limit the efficacy of contact tracing.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248299; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248299v1?rss=1";18/12/2020;Contact tracing;0.9208
1343;A Review of Robotic Interventional Neuroradiology.;10.3174/ajnr.a6976;Robotic interventional neuroradiology is an emerging field with the potential to enhance patient safety, reduce occupational hazards, and expand systems of care. Endovascular robots allow the operator to precisely control guidewires and catheters from a lead-shielded cockpit located several feet (or potentially hundreds of miles) from the patient. This has opened up the possibility of expanding telestroke networks to patients without access to life-saving procedures such as stroke thrombectomy and cerebral aneurysm occlusion by highly-experienced physicians. The prototype machines, first developed in the early 2000s, have evolved into machines capable of a broad range of techniques, while incorporating newly automated maneuvers and safety algorithms. In recent years, preliminary clinical research has been published demonstrating the safety and feasibility of the technology in cerebral angiography and intracranial intervention.

MAIN BODY: The Herpesviridae family uses a number of proteins that are responsible for host shutoff by directly targeting messenger RNA (mRNA), including virion host shutoff (VHS) protein and the immediate-early regulatory protein ICP27 of herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and the SOX (shutoff and exonuclease) protein and its homologs in Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies, although these proteins are not homologous. In this review, we highlight evidence that host shutoff is promoted by the VHS, ICP27 and SOX-like proteins and that they also contribute to immune evasion. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies regarding the host shutoff proteins will not only contribute to provide new insights into the viral replication, expression and host immune evasion process, but also provide new molecular targets for the development of antiviral drugs and therapies.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32430029/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01336-8";19/5/2020;Host shutoff;0.9305

Our hypothesis regarding the levels of support measures for housing sector for different regions is that it needs to be synchronized with the size of the clusters (defined as Russian regions or subjects of Russian Federation) and their respective forecast of economic development. Based on our analysis, we conclude that this requirement is not fulfilled, which results in skewed support for housing construction companies (and their projects) in only a handful of Russian regions thereby posing risks of reaching goals of National project “Housing and urban environment”. We also expect that the government will continue expanding the measures of housing construction support with a potential of an increased housing sector centralization.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971615/;12/9/2020;multi-family housing construction industry;0.9282

At the same time, more health workers in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) including Ghana are contracting COVID-19. This poses healthcare utilization concerns for older adults. As a result, many older adults are changing their health-seeking behavior by staying at home and resorting to informal healthcare such as the use of traditional therapies and over-the-counter medicines for self-treatment or to boost their immune system. This commentary calls for social workers to collaborate with health authorities and community pharmacists to develop social and health programs to increase older adults' access to healthcare during the COVID-19 crisis. Policies are also required to deal with the pandemic and its impact on health systems in LMICs for both short and long term.

Using whole-exome sequencing in a family with three cases of POI, we identified the candidate missense variant S167L in HSF2BP, an essential meiotic gene. Functional analysis of the HSF2BP-S167L variant in mouse showed that it behaves as a hypomorphic allele compared to a new loss-of-function (knock-out) mouse model. Hsf2bp(S167L/S167L) females show reduced fertility with smaller litter sizes. To obtain mechanistic insights, we identified C19ORF57/BRME1 as a strong interactor and stabilizer of HSF2BP and showed that the BRME1/HSF2BP protein complex co-immunoprecipitates with BRCA2, RAD51, RPA and PALB2. Meiocytes bearing the HSF2BP-S167L variant showed a strongly decreased staining of both HSF2BP and BRME1 at the recombination nodules and a reduced number of the foci formed by the recombinases RAD51/DMC1, thus leading to a lower frequency of crossovers.

1350;Pandemic shocks and fiscal-monetary policies in the Eurozone: COVID-19 dominance during January–June 2020;10.1093/oep/gpab010;We compare the importance of market factors against that of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) dynamics and policy responses in explaining Eurozone sovereign spreads. First, we estimate a multifactor model for changes in credit default swap (CDS) spreads over 2014 to June 2019. Then, we apply a synthetic control-type procedure to extrapolate model-implied changes in CDS. The factor model does very well over the rest of 2019 but breaks down during the pandemic, especially during March 2020. We find that the March 2020 divergence is well accounted for by COVID-specific risks and associated policies, mortality outcomes, and policy announcements, rather than traditional determinants. Daily CDS widening ceased almost immediately after the European Central Bank announced the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, but the divergence between actual and model-implied changes persisted. This points to COVID-19 Dominance—widening spreads during the pandemic has led to unconventional monetary policies that primarily aim to mitigate short-run fears, temporarily pushing away concerns over fiscal risk.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083783/;22/3/2021;coronavirus disease-19;0.9414

Mismanagement of personal protective equipment (PPE) during COVID-19 pandemic, with a monthly estimated use of 129 billion face masks and 65 billion gloves globally, is resulting in widespread environmental contamination. This poses a risk to public health as a vector for SARS-CoV-2 virus, which survives up to 3 days on plastics, as well as impacts to ecosystems and organisms more broadly functions. Concerns over the role of reusable plastics as vectors for SARS-CoV-2 virus contributed to the reversal of bans on single-use plastics, highly supported by the plastic industry. While not underestimating the importance of plastics in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission, it is imperative not to undermine recent progress made in the sustainable use of plastics. There is a need to assess alternatives that allow reductions of PPE and reinforce awareness on the proper public use and disposal.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to sort and develop novel agents for the prevention and treatment of viral infections. A rapid structure-based virtual screening is used for the evaluation of current commercial drugs, with structures of human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), and viral main protease, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. Our results reveal that the reported drugs Arbidol, Chloroquine and Remdesivir may hinder the entry and release of virions through the bindings with ACE2, spike and envelope proteins. Due to the similar binding patterns, NHC (β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine) and Triazavirin are also in prospects for clinical use. Main protease (3CLpro) is likely to be a feasible target of drug design. The screening results to target 3CL-pro reveal that Mitoguazone, Metformin, Biguanide Hydrochloride, Gallic acid, Caffeic acid, Sulfaguanidine and Acetylcysteine seem be possible inhibitors and have potential application in the clinical therapy of COVID-19.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351243/;5/5/2020;Coronavirus Disease 2019;0.935
1357;"Innovative CAR-T Cell Therapy for Solid Tumor; Current Duel between CAR-T Spear and Tumor Shield";10.3390/cancers12082087;Novel engineered T cells containing chimeric antigen receptors (CAR-T cells) that combine the benefits of antigen recognition and T cell response have been developed, and their effect in the anti-tumor immunotherapy of patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia has been dramatic. Thus, CAR-T cell immunotherapy is rapidly emerging as a new therapy. However, it has limitations that prevent consistency in therapeutic effects in solid tumors, which accounts for over 90% of all cancer patients. Here, we review the literature regarding various obstacles to CAR-T cell immunotherapy for solid tumors, including those that cause CAR-T cell dysfunction in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, such as reactive oxygen species, pH, O(2), immunosuppressive cells, cytokines, and metabolites, as well as those that impair cell trafficking into the tumor microenvironment. Next-generation CAR-T cell therapy is currently undergoing clinical trials to overcome these challenges. Therefore, novel approaches to address the challenges faced by CAR-T cell immunotherapy in solid tumors are also discussed here.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12082087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32731404/";28/7/2020;chimeric antigen receptors;0.9071
1358;False‐positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 in the setting of urgent head and neck surgery and otolaryngologic emergencies during the pandemic: Clinical implications;10.1002/hed.26317;BACKGROUND: No reports describe falsepositive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) for novel coronavirus in preoperative screening. METHODS: Preoperative patients had one or two nasopharyngeal swabs, depending on low or high risk of viral transmission. Positive tests were repeated. RESULTS: Forty‐three of 52 patients required two or more preoperative tests. Four (9.3%) had discrepant results (positive/negative). One of these left the coronavirus disease (COVID) unit against medical advice despite an orbital abscess, with unknown true disease status. The remaining 3 of 42 (7.1%) had negative repeat RT‐PCR. Although ultimately considered falsepositives, one was sent to a COVID unit postoperatively and two had urgent surgery delayed. Assuming negative repeat RT‐PCR, clear chest imaging, and lack of subsequent symptoms represent the “gold standard,” RT‐PCR specificity was 0.97. CONCLUSIONS: If false positives are suspected, we recommend computed tomography (CT) of the chest and repeat RT‐PCR. Validated serum immunoglobulin testing may ultimately prove useful.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530131/";12/6/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9803
1359;A short review on key role of plants and their extracts in boosting up immune response to combat COVID-19.;10.2174/1871526521666210527091939;In the wake of the recent global pandemic of COVID-19, there has been an increasing concern among the general public to improve their immune system. The causative agent of COVID-19 is SARS CoV-2, similar to its relative viruses SARS Cov-1 and MERS. Up till now, no vaccine has been developed against this disease and the only way one can stay safe is via prevention and developing one's immune system. Plants have been used since ancient times in herbal medicines and many chemicals and extracts in them are found to boost the immune system. Therefore, a consciously maintained diet consisting of plant-based immunity boosters is the need of the hour. Plants are known to provide many chemicals, natural therapeutics and vitamins which naturally enhance our immune system. Recently, vaccination research is also being carried out in transgenic plants. In this review, we have focused on highlighting some of the main players within the Kingdom Plantae which, when taken up in regular diet, can significantly boost our immune system capacity and thus provide the best possible measure to combat this pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.2174/1871526521666210527091939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047261/";26/5/2021;SARS CoV-2;0.961

Many vulnerable newborn infants have been admitted to the neonatal care unit (NCU) at the National Maternal and Child Health Center in Phnom Penh. Although the staff have implemented strict infection prevention and control measures, formidable gaps in neonatal care between Cambodia and Japan exist. Due to the shortages in professional workforce, one family member of sick newborn(s) should stay for 24 hours in the NCU to care for the baby.

1361;Scared into Action: How Partisanship and Fear are Associated with Reactions to Public Health Directives;10.31234/osf.io/8me7q;Differences in political ideology are increasingly appearing as an impediment to successful bipartisan communication from local leadership. For example, recent empirical findings have shown that conservatives are less likely to adhere to COVID-19 health directives. This behavior is in direct contradiction to past research which indicates that conservatives are more rule abiding, prefer to avoid loss, and are more prevention-motivated than liberals. We reconcile this disconnect between recent empirical findings and past research by using insights gathered from press releases, millions of tweets, and mobility data capturing local movement in retail, grocery, workplace, parks, and transit domains during COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. We find that conservatives adhere to health directives when they express more fear of the virus. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we analyze both official and citizen communications and find that press releases from local and federal government, along with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, lead to an increase in expressions of fear on Twitter.;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05365v1.pdf;14/1/2021;shelter-in-place orders;0.9167

Medical students require considerable clinical exposure. However, due to the risk of COVID-19, the majority of medical schools globally have discontinued their normal activities. The strengths of virtual teaching now include a variety of web-based resources. New interactive forms of virtual teaching are being developed to enable students to interact with patients from their homes. Conversely, students have received decreased clinical training in certain medical and surgical specialities, which may, in turn, reduce their performance, confidence, and abilities as future physicians. We sought to analyze the effect of telemedicine on the quality of medical education in this new emerging era and highlight the benefits and drawbacks of web-based medical training in building up future physicians. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unparalleled challenge to medical schools, which are aiming to deliver quality education to students virtually, balancing between evidence-based and experience-based medicine.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/15347346211011848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33890811/";23/4/2021;coronavirus infectious disease;0.9849

However, there are many complications associated with this procedure, including Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT.) Despite its rarity in ECMO cases, HIT can lead to devastating consequences and is difficult to manage. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present a case of a COVID-19 patient on ECMO support who was diagnosed with HIT and required intensive treatment. Initially, HIT was only suspected due to newly-developed thrombocytopenia and oxygenator dysfunction, with thrombi observed later. Regarding his treatment, since there was no recommended replacement to heparin available to us at the time of diagnosis, we decided to use rivaroxaban temporarily. No adverse events were recorded during that period. The patient was able to make a full recovery. CONCLUSION: HIT may jeopardize patient’s care during ECMO. As COVID-19 may bring about a surge in the number of patients requiring ECMO support, we need consented guidance to optimize treatment in this specific situation.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33317566/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12959-020-00252-9";14/12/2020;Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation;0.9471

We analyzed 68,557 single-nucleus transcriptomes from three brain regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medulla oblongata and choroid plexus) and identified an increased proportion of stromal cells and monocytes in the choroid plexus of COVID-19 patients. Differential gene expression, pseudo-temporal trajectory and gene regulatory network analyses revealed microglial transcriptome perturbations, mediating a range of biological processes, including cellular activation, mobility and phagocytosis. Quantification of viral spike S1 protein and SARS-CoV-2 transcripts did not support the notion of brain tropism. Overall, our findings suggest extensive neuroinflammation in patients with acute COVID-19.

Under clinical trials, some of the repurposed antiviral drugs have been applied to COVID‐19 patients and reported the efficacy of the drugs with the diverse inferences. Molecular topology has been developed in recent years as an influential approach for drug design and discovery in which molecules that are structurally related show similar pharmacological properties. It permits a purely mathematical description of the molecular structure so that in the development of identification of new drugs can be found through adequate topological indices. In this paper, we study the structural properties of the several antiviral drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, theaflavin, nafamostat, camostat, umifenovir and bevacizumab by considering the distance and bond measures of chemical compounds.

The need for ready access to scientifically sound treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is urgent, but gold-standard agonist therapy is often inaccessible. • Drug courts should help to reduce barriers to OUD therapy by offering court-supervised treatment as an alternative to criminal prosecution for certain categories of drug offenses. • Many drug courts, however, reject including the opioid agonist methadone and partial agonist buprenorphine as treatment options, often because these medicines are seen as “another form of addiction”. • Many US drug courts have steered participants to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), an opioid antagonist, sometimes offering only XR-NTX and no agonist therapies. XR-NTX is very expensive in the US market and also requires a period of abstinence before it can be initiated. • Drug courts overall have had limited success in improving access to OUD treatment and other health and social services needed to achieve significant reduction in overdose death.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666353820300175; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666353820300175?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171038/";9/6/2020;opioid use disorder;0.9339

1370;Strategic Use of Data Assimilation for Dynamic Data-Driven Simulation;10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_3;Dynamic data-driven simulation (DDDS) incorporates real-time measurement data to improve simulation models during model run-time. Data assimilation (DA) methods aim to best approximate model states with imperfect measurements, where particle Filters (PFs) are commonly used with discrete-event simulations. In this paper, we study three critical conditions of DA using PFs: (1) the time interval of iterations, (2) the number of particles and (3) the level of actual and perceived measurement errors (or noises), and provide recommendations on how to strategically use data assimilation for DDDS considering these conditions. The results show that the estimation accuracy in DA is more constrained by the choice of time intervals than the number of particles. Good accuracy can be achieved without many particles if the time interval is sufficiently short. An over estimation of the level of measurement errors has advantages over an under estimation. Moreover, a slight over estimation has better estimation accuracy and is more responsive to system changes than an accurate perceived level of measurement errors.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304738/;25/5/2020;Dynamic data-driven simulation;0.9402

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, in this study, we report that the city lockdown measure was an effective way to reduce the number of new cases, and the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration can be adopted as an environmental lockdown indicator. In China, after strict city lockdown, the average NO2 concentration decreased 55.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 51.5-59.6%) and the total number of confirmed new cases decreased significantly. We also determined that the global airborne NO2 concentration steeply decreased over the vast majority of COVID-19-hit areas based on satellite measurements. We found that if NO2 emissions significantly decreased, the total number of confirmed new cases reached an inflection point after approximately two weeks. Italy, Germany and France are good examples.

They have been created by a set of transforms based on an adaptation and extension of the CHMTRN/PATRAN programming languages describing chemical synthesis expert knowledge, which originally stem from the LHASA project. The chemoinformatics toolkit CACTVS was used to apply a total of 53 transforms to about 150,000 readily available building blocks (enamine.net). Only single-step, two-reactant syntheses were calculated for this database even though the technology can execute multi-step reactions. The possibility to incorporate scoring systems in CHMTRN allowed us to subdivide the database of 1.75 billion compounds in sets according to their predicted synthesizability, with the most-synthesizable class comprising 1.09 billion synthetic products. Properties calculated for all SAVI products show that the database should be well-suited for drug discovery.

Existing work on AARA has focused on bounds that are polynomial in the sizes of the inputs. This paper presents and extension of AARA to exponential bounds that preserves the benefits of the technique, such as compositionality and efficient type inference based on linear constraint solving. A key idea is the use of the Stirling numbers of the second kind as the basis of potential functions, which play the same role as the binomial coefficients in polynomial AARA. To formalize the similarities with the existing analyses, the paper presents a general methodology for AARA that is instantiated to the polynomial version, the exponential version, and a combined system with potential functions that are formed by products of Stirling numbers and binomial coefficients. The soundness of exponential AARA is proved with respect to an operational cost semantics and the analysis of representative example programs demonstrates the effectiveness of the new analysis.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7788609/;17/4/2020;Automatic amortized resource analysis;0.9368

The goal of this review is to provide an overview of what is known about the clinical course of COVID-19 in pregnancy, drawing on 1) experience with other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, 2) knowledge of immunologic and physiologic changes in pregnancy and how these might impact infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 3) the current literature reporting outcomes in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2. We also briefly summarize considerations in management of severe COVID-19 in pregnancy.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/aji.13332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32865300/";31/8/2020;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9785
1380;Uncovering the Gene Regulatory Networks Underlying Macrophage Polarization Through Comparative Analysis of Bulk and Single-Cell Data;10.1101/2021.01.20.427499;Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a powerful framework for studying cellular differentiation. However, it is less clear how GRNs encode cellular responses to everyday microenvironmental cues. Macrophages can be polarized and potentially repolarized based on environmental signaling. In order to identify the GRNs that drive macrophage polarization and the heterogeneous single-cell subpopulations that are present in the process, we used a high-resolution time course of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq assays of HL-60-derived macrophages polarized towards M1 or M2 over 24 hours. We identified transient M1 and M2 markers, including the main transcription factors that underlie polarization, and subpopulations of naive, transitional, and terminally polarized macrophages. We built bulk and single-cell polarization GRNs to compare the recovered interactions and found that each technology recovered only a subset of known interactions. Our data provide a resource to study the GRN of cellular maturation in response to microenvironmental stimuli in a variety of contexts in homeostasis and disease.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.20.427499;21/1/2021;Gene regulatory networks;0.9738
1381;The use of thromboelastography to assess post-operative changes in coagulation and predict graft function in renal transplantation();10.1016/j.amjsurg.2020.08.019;BACKGROUND: End stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with elevated fibrinogen levels and fibrinolysis inhibition. However, there is a paucity of data on how renal transplantation impacts coagulation. we hypothesize that renal transplantation recipients with good functioning grafts will have improved fibrinolytic activity following surgery. METHODS: Kidney recipients were analyzed pre-operatively and on post-operative day 1(POD1) using three different TEG assays with and without two concentration of tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA). TEG indices and percent reduction in creatinine from pre-op to POD1 were measured, with >50% defining “good” graft function. Follow up was done at 6, 12, and 24 months. RESULTS: Percent lysis(LY30) on POD1 the t-PA TEG was significantly correlated to change creatinine from pre-op to POD-1(p = 0.006). A LY30 ≥ 23% was associated with good early graft function, and lower creatinine at 24-months(p = 0.028) compared to recipients with low POD1 LY30. CONCLUSIONS: Post-operative tPA-TEG LY30 is associated with favorable early and late outcomes in kidney transplant.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002961020305109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32878689/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002961020305109?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2020.08.019";27/8/2020;End stage renal disease;0.987
1382;Ways of Enriching MOOCs for Higher Education: A Philosophy Course;10.1007/978-3-030-65857-1_29;Using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) in higher education poses new challenges that include the following: an increase in the number of students taught by one teacher, which makes it difficult to individualize the tasks, the easy access to other students' answers due to the social media, the lower engagement of students when studying online. In the situation of the complete transition to e-education due to the 2020 pandemic, teachers were forced to solve these problems in the electronic environment. This article presents the case of enriching the online Philosophy course given to students of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University by creating new assignments in various forms: video blogging, multimedia projects and in-depth study of philosophical texts. In this respect, the current situation becomes advantageous and allows the lecturers to achieve better results due to the availability of all ideas and experiences and the collaborative activities of the students. The variety of approaches used in studying the Philosophy course confirms the important role of the teacher in e-learning.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972531/;19/11/2020;Massive Open Online Courses;0.9843
1383;Optimal shutdown strategies for COVID-19 with economic and mortality costs: BC as a case study;10.1101/2020.11.25.20239004;Decision makers with the responsibility of managing policy for the COVID-19 epidemic have faced difficult choices in balancing the competing claims of saving lives and the high economic cost of shutdowns. In this paper we formulate a model with both epidemiological and economic content to assist this decision making process. We consider two ways to handle the balance between economic costs and deaths. First, we use the statistical value of life, which in Canada is about C$7 million, to optimise over a single variable, which is the sum of the economic cost and the value of lives lost. Our second method is to calculate the Pareto optimal front when we look at the two variables -- deaths and economic costs. In both cases we find that, for most parameter values, the optimal policy is to adopt an initial shutdown level which reduces the reproduction number of the epidemic to close to 1. This level is then reduced once a vaccination program is underway. Our model also indicates that an oscillating policy of strict and mild shutdowns is less effective than a policy which maintains a moderate shutdown level.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.20239004; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.25.20239004v1?rss=1";30/11/2020;managing policy;0.9445

With the evolution of the pandemic, skin lesions were observed. However, there is little information about the evolution of the lesions at this moment. The authors report a case of a patient who had more than one exposure to the coronavirus during the evolution of the disease and manifested different types of edematous lesions. The lesions started in the prodromal period and changed their presentation and localization during the evolution of COVID-19. The lesions regressed quickly with the use of corticoid cream and antihistamine. Viral skin lesions are frequent causes of exanthema. However, viral etiology is not always investigated in acute urticarial and atypical erythematous-edematous conditions. The immunological basis of acute urticaria has points in common with COVID-19, justifying the appearance of lesions. Investigation of viral etiology should always be remembered in acute urticarial and edematous conditions.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00403-020-02091-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409976/";14/5/2020;coronavirus;0.9802

Clinical complication and fatality rate is much higher for patients having co-morbid issues. Compromised immune response and hyper inflammation is hall mark of pathogenesis and major cause of mortality. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm is a term used to affiliate the situation of hyper inflammation and therefore use of anti-cytokine and anti-inflammatory drugs is used to take care of this situation. Looking into the clinical benefit of these anti-inflammatory drugs, many of them enter into clinical trials. However, understanding the immunopathology of COVID-19 is important otherwise, indiscriminate use of these drugs could be fetal as there exists a very fine line of difference between viral clearing cytokines and inflammatory cytokines. If any drug suppresses the viral clearing cytokines, it will worsen the situation and hence, the use of these drugs must be based on the clinical condition, viral load, co-existing disease condition and severity of the infection.;"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1291-7692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434935/";12/1/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9923

Although several factors of this infection and its consequences are not completely clear, the presence and involvement of specific chemokines is undoubtedly crucial for the development and progression of COVID-19. Cytokine storm and the often-resulting cytokine release syndrome (CRS) are pathophysiological hallmarks in COVID-19 infections related to its most severe and fatal cases. In this hyperinflammatory event, chemokines and other cytokines are highly upregulated and are therefore not fulfilling their beneficial function in the host response anymore but causing harmful effects. Here, we present the recent views on the involvement of chemokines and selected cytokines in COVID-19 and the therapeutics currently in clinical development targeting or interfering with them, discussing their potentials in the treatment of COVID-19 infections.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33445810/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11010091";12/1/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9593

Role of Leader Behavioral Integrity;10.3389/fpsyg.2021.646442;The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has badly affected the social, physical, and emotional health of workers, especially those working in the healthcare sectors. Drawing on social exchange theory, we investigated the effects of participative leadership on employees’ workplace thriving and helping behaviors among frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we examined the moderating role of a leader’s behavioral integrity in strengthening the relationship between participative leadership, and employees’ workplace thriving and helping behaviors. By using a two-wave time-lagged design and data collected from 244 healthcare workers, a moderated hierarchal regression was implemented to test the proposed hypotheses. As hypothesized, participative leadership predicted employees’ workplace thriving and helping behaviors. The leader’s behavioral integrity strengthened the relationship between participative leadership and employees’ thriving and moderated the relationship between participative leadership helping behaviors.

1388;Screening of Foreign Direct Investment and the States’ Security Interests in Light of the OECD, UNCTAD and Other International Guidelines;10.1007/978-3-030-58916-5_10;This chapter analyses the concept of the “national security interest”, which is widely recognised as allowing a state to determine which areas of its economy are restricted or prohibited to foreign investors. This chapter seeks to identify what constitutes a threat for a state and how that threat is managed both domestically and internationally. Despite the recognition of a state’s right to take measures it considers essential to its security, there are limits. The rules established by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and other international instruments are non-binding but can serve as a guide for states in determining the limits of the national security approach. International investment agreements can restrict the right of states to take security-related measures. Finally, customary international law, in light of the good faith obligation, can serve as a basis for assessing measures taken by a state and pave the way for a better balance between the rights of a state and those of foreign investors.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7927795/;4/3/2021;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development;0.9315
1389;Normal Grouping Density Separation (NGDS): A Novel Object-Driven Indoor Point Cloud Partition Method;10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_8;Precise segmentation/partition is an essential part of many point cloud processing strategies. In the state-of-the-art methods, either the number of clusters or expected supervoxel resolution needs to be carefully selected before segmentation. This makes these processes semi-supervised. The proposed Normal Grouping- Density Separation (NGDS) strategy, relying on both grouping normal vectors into cardinal directions and density-based separation, produces clusters of better (according to use quality measures) quality than current state-of-the-art methods for widely applied object-annotated indoor benchmark dataset. The method reaches, on average, lower under-segmentation error than VCCS (by 45.9pp), Lin et al. (by 14.8pp), and SSP (by 26.2pp). Another metric - achievable segmentation accuracy - yields 92.1% across the tested dataset what is higher value than VCCS (by 14pp), Lin et al. (by 3.8pp), and SSP (by 10.3pp). The experiment carried out indicates superiority of the proposed method as a partition/segmentation algorithm - a process being usually a preprocessing stage of many object detection workflows.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304708/;25/5/2020;Normal Grouping- Density Separation;0.936
1390;Corticosteroids, COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.;10.1172/jci143331;While corticosteroids dampen the dysregulated immune system and sometimes are prescribed as an adjunctive treatment for pneumonia, their effectiveness in the treatment of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial. In this issue of the JCI, Liu and Zhang et al. evaluated corticosteroid treatment in more than 400 patients with severe COVID-19. The authors assessed subjects retrospectively for cardiac and liver injury, shock, ventilation, mortality, and viral clearance. Corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was associated with increased mortality and delayed viral clearance. Here, we consider how to reconcile the negative effects of corticosteroids revealed by Liu and Zhang et al. with the favorable effects (reduced mortality) that were described in the RECOVERY trial. We posit that treatment timing, dosage, and COVID-19 disease severity determine immune response and viral outcome. Patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia are likely to benefit from moderate dose corticosteroid treatment when administered relatively late in the disease course.;"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci143331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976118/";25/9/2020;acute respiratory distress syndrome;0.9756
1391;Insights from Genomes and Genetic Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the state of Andhra Pradesh;10.1101/2021.01.22.427775;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged from a city in China and has now spread as a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals. The causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 is being extensively studied in terms of its genetic epidemiology using genomic approaches. Andhra Pradesh is one of the major states of India with the third-largest number of COVID-19 cases with limited understanding of its genetic epidemiology. In this study, we have sequenced 293 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates from Andhra Pradesh with a mean coverage of 13,324X. We identified 564 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 variants, out of which 15 are novel. A total of 18 variants mapped to RT-PCR primer/probe sites, and 4 variants are known to be associated with an increase in infectivity. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes revealed the circulating SARS-CoV-2 in Andhra Pradesh majorly clustered under the clade A2a (94%), while 6% fall under the I/A3i clade, a clade previously defined to be present in large numbers in India. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive genetic epidemiological analysis performed for the state of Andhra Pradesh.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.22.427775;22/1/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9901

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS Two unrelated patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and bilateral acute conjunctivitis were examined. Conjunctival swabs were assessed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture. RESULTS Both patients developed eye redness 3 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Slit lamp examination showed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis, which was resolved within 6 days. RT-PCR demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in conjunctival specimens from both eyes, which was unrelated to viral RNA from throat swabs. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 may cause ocular manifestations such as viral conjunctivitis. Conjunctival sampling may be useful for infected patients with conjunctivitis and fever.

1393;Metabolic Spectrum of Liver Failure in Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity: From NAFLD to NASH to HCC;10.3390/ijms22094495;Liver disease is the spectrum of liver damage ranging from simple steatosis called as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Clinically, NAFLD and type 2 diabetes coexist. Type 2 diabetes contributes to biological processes driving the severity of NAFLD, the primary cause for development of chronic liver diseases. In the last 20 years, the rate of non-viral NAFLD/NASH-derived HCC has been increasing rapidly. As there are currently no suitable drugs for treatment of NAFLD and NASH, a class of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is sometimes used to improve liver failure despite the risk of side effects. Therefore, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the development and progression of NAFLD and NASH are important issues. In this review, we will discuss the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH and NAFLD/NASH-derived HCC and the current promising pharmacological therapies of NAFLD/NASH. Further, we will provide insights into “adipose-derived adipokines” and “liver-derived hepatokines” as diagnostic and therapeutic targets from NAFLD to HCC.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8123490/;26/4/2021;hepatocellular carcinoma;0.9774

Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia (THI) is a benign condition associated with marked elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) without any other kidney, bone, and liver pathologies. CASE PRESENTATION Herein, we report a previously healthy 16-month-old female patient who developed a secondary transient benign hyperphosphatasemia associated with SARS-CoV-2. Patient whole family's SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were positive. Since THI is a diagnosis of exclusion, other reasons that may cause ALP elevation should be ruled out. ALP activity decreased and turned to normal ranges within the following month. THI has been reported to be in association with various conditions. Its relationship with many viruses has been reported previously. CONCLUSIONS If ALP elevation is detected in patients with COVID 19 due to the increasing number of infections, THI should be considered if there is no other accompanying pathology.;"https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2020-0503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577728/";11/12/2020;OBJECTIVES Coronavirus disease;0.9467
1395;Research Progress of Oxidative Stress and MicroRNAs in the Prevention of Catheter-Related Thrombus Under Resistance Exercise;10.1177/1076029620931931;Central venous access devices (CVADs) have completely changed the care for patients who require long-term venous access. With the widespread use of CVADs, the incidence of catheter-related thrombus (CRT) has increased. Catheter-related thrombus is a common complication in patients who use CVADs and is mainly caused by endothelial injury, blood stasis, and hypercoagulability. In recent years, the correlations between oxidative stress (OS) and microRNA (miRNA) and CRT have become a hot topic in clinical research. When a catheter punctures the vessel wall, it causes OS damage to the vascular endothelial cells, leading to a series of CRT diseases. MicroRNAs can regulate the mechanism of thrombus and play an important role in the formation of anti-thrombus. Numerous studies have shown that resistance exercise can reduce the level of OS in vascular endothelial cells, inhibit vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, and maintain the stability of hemodynamics and biochemical state. In the current work, the recent studies on the effects of resistance exercise on OS and miRNA in vascular endothelial cells were reviewed.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7427020/;15/6/2020;Central venous access devices;0.9785

However, the importance of including a robust debriefing as a component of these simulations is often neglected. PROBLEM Failing to include debriefing with screen-based simulation could negatively impact student learning outcomes. APPROACH Debriefing, including recollection, discussion to reveal understanding, feedback and reflection, is a process of helping learners make sense of learned content and knowledge as it is applied to the patient care experience. Debriefing for Meaningful Learning (DML) is an evidence-based method derived from theory, which can be easily incorporated into screen-based simulation to augment the clinical learning experience. CONCLUSION By guiding learners to consistently engage in DML, clinical decisions and actions taken during virtual simulations can be uncovered, discussed, challenged, corrected, and explored. Including a synchronous, structured debriefing like DML ensures that screen-based simulation results in meaningful learning in addition to performance feedback to foster safe and quality patient care.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/nne.0000000000000930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33093345/";18/10/2020;BACKGROUND;0.9026
1398;The “Intubox”: Enhancing Frontline Healthcare Worker Safety During Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19);10.7759/cureus.8530;There has been a substantial burden of healthcare worker infection during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, likely due to a lack of adequate preparedness, suboptimal institutional infection control measures, atypical patient presentation, poor compliance with personal protective equipment (PPE) and exposure to high-risk aerosol generating procedures, such as endotracheal intubation. There is significant concern that developing countries will face heightened levels of staff exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate this exposure risk during procedures, such as endotracheal intubation, various “aerosol boxes” have been designed by frontline healthcare workers. However, in practice these boxes were found to hamper endotracheal intubation and other procedures due to the limited space and manoeuvrability they allow. To further reduce particle dispersion and to improve on the practicality and ergonomic design of the prototype “aerosol box”, the Intubox was developed by staff at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital after instituting several changes to the prototype design.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32665877/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8530";9/6/2020;coronavirus;0.997

The impact of this post-translational modification on viral entry is yet unestablished. We expressed different glycoforms of the Spike-protein and ACE2 in CRISPR-Cas9 glycoengineered cells, and developed corresponding SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. We observed that N- and O-glycans had only minor contribution to Spike-ACE2 binding. However, these carbohydrates played a major role in regulating viral entry. Blocking N-glycan biosynthesis at the oligomannose stage using both genetic approaches and the small molecule kifunensine dramatically reduced viral entry into ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells. Blocking O-glycan elaboration also partially blocked viral entry. Mechanistic studies suggest multiple roles for glycans during viral entry. Among them, inhibition of N-glycan biosynthesis enhanced Spike-protein proteolysis. This could reduce RBD presentation on virus, lowering binding to host ACE2 and decreasing viral entry. Overall, chemical inhibitors of glycosylation may be evaluated for COVID-19.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.339838;15/10/2020;receptor binding domain;0.9043

A vaccine targeting fentanyl could be a powerful immunotherapeutic. Here, we evaluated adjuvant and delivery strategies for conjugate antigen vaccination with fentanyl-based haptens. We tested adjuvants derived from the heat-labile toxin of E. coli including dmLT and LTA1 by intramuscular, sublingual or intranasal delivery. Our results show anti-fentanyl serum antibodies and antibody secreting cells in the bone-marrow after vaccination with highest levels observed with an adjuvant (alum, dmLT, or LTA1). Vaccine adjuvanted with LTA1 or dmLT elicited the highest levels of anti-fentanyl antibodies, whereas alum achieved highest levels against the carrier protein. Vaccination with sublingual dmLT or intranasal LTA1 provided the most robust blockade of fentanyl-induced analgesia and CNS penetration correlating strongly to anti-FEN IgA. In conclusion, this study demonstrates dmLT or LTA1 adjuvant as well as mucosal delivery may be attractive strategies for improving the efficacy of vaccines against SUD.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8119695/;13/5/2021;substance use disorders;0.9785
1403;Extended Reality (XR) Remote Research: a Survey of Drawbacks and Opportunities;10.1145/3411764.3445170;Extended Reality (XR) technology - such as virtual and augmented reality - is now widely used in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), social science and psychology experimentation. However, these experiments are predominantly deployed in-lab with a co-present researcher. Remote experiments, without co-present researchers, have not flourished, despite the success of remote approaches for non-XR investigations. This paper summarises findings from a 30-item survey of 46 XR researchers to understand perceived limitations and benefits of remote XR experimentation. Our thematic analysis identifies concerns common with non-XR remote research, such as participant recruitment, as well as XR-specific issues, including safety and hardware variability. We identify potential positive affordances of XR technology, including leveraging data collection functionalities builtin to HMDs (e.g. hand, gaze tracking) and the portability and reproducibility of an experimental setting. We suggest that XR technology could be conceptualised as an interactive technology and a capable data-collection device suited for remote experimentation.;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08046v1.pdf;20/1/2021;Human Computer Interaction;0.9873

We used the SARS-CoV-2 MA10 mouse model of acute lung injury to evaluate the immune response and potential for immunopathology in animals vaccinated with research-grade mRNA-1273. Whole-inactivated virus or heat-denatured spike protein subunit vaccines with alum designed to elicit low-potency antibodies and Th2-skewed CD4+ T cells resulted in reduced viral titers and weight loss post-challenge, but more severe pathological changes in the lung compared to saline-immunized animals. In contrast, a protective dose of mRNA-1273 induced favorable humoral and cellular immune responses that protected from viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract upon challenge. A subprotective dose of mRNA-1273 reduced viral replication and limited histopathological manifestations compared to animals given saline. Overall, our findings demonstrate an immunological signature associated with antiviral protection without disease enhancement following vaccination with mRNA-1273.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761321002624; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761321002624?v=s5";2/7/2021;Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease;0.9425
1405;The impact of long-term opioid use on the risk and severity of COVID-19.;10.5055/jom.2020.0597;Based on evidence of the immunosuppressive effects of chronic opioids, long-term users of prescription and illicit opioids comprise an unrecognized but growing population of Americans with compromised immune function and respiratory depression who may be at high risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related hospitalization, prolonged ICU stay, adverse events, and death. This perspective is of broad clinical and public health importance because the US has the highest population of long-term users of prescription opioids, a sequel of a decade-long practice of opioid overprescribing in the US. For long-term opioid users who are hospitalized for COVID-19, clinicians face clinical challenges arising from the suppressive effects of opioids on the respiratory and immune functions, as well as the potential for adverse drug-drug interaction when opioids have to be continued in long-term users. More research is needed to further understand the association of long-term opioid use and susceptibility to COVID-19 and other emerging infections.;"https://doi.org/10.5055/jom.2020.0597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33428186/";1/1/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9716
1406;Recognition of Divergent Viral Substrates by the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease;10.1101/2021.04.20.440716;The main protease (Mpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is an ideal target for pharmaceutical inhibition. It is required for infection, it cleaves the viral polyprotein at multiple sites, and it is conserved among coronaviruses and distinct from human proteases. We present crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro bound to two viral substrate peptides. The structures show how Mpro recognizes substrates and how the peptide sequence can dictate catalytic efficiency by influencing the position of the scissile bond. One peptide, constituting the junction between viral non-structural proteins 8 and 9 (nsp8/9), has P1’ and P2’ residues that are unique among SARS-CoV-2 cleavage sites but conserved among nsp8/9 junctions in coronaviruses. Mpro cleaves nsp8/9 inefficiently, and amino acid substitutions at P1’ or P2’ can enhance catalysis. Visualization of Mpro with intact substrates provides new templates for antiviral drug design and suggests that the coronavirus lifecycle selects for finely tuned substrate-dependent catalytic parameters.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.20.440716;21/4/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9841

Both at the stage of diagnostics prior to admission to the intensive care unit and during the monitoring of lesion evolution, diagnostic imaging techniques may significantly influence clinical decisions. Although computed tomography remains the gold standard for diagnosing lung diseases, its usefulness for infected, critically ill patients has been largely limited during the pandemic. Reports from those countries in which the healthcare systems were most seriously overloaded with patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia stress the key role of point-of-care lung ultrasound performed by clinicians first during preliminary diagnostics and then while monitoring disease dynamics. This consensus, worked out by an interdisciplinary team of specialists forming the Study Group for Point-of-Care Lung Ultrasound in the Intensive Care Management of COVID-19 Patients, presents a broad spectrum of aspects regarding the analysed issue.

Concepts and terms used to describe populations disproportionately impacted in emergencies vary over time and across disciplines, but United States (U.S.) federal guidance and law require equal access to our nation's emergency resources. At all levels of emergency planning, public health and their partners must be accountable to populations with existing inequities, which requires a conceptual shift towards using the data-driven social determinants of health (SDOH). SDOH are conditions in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality of life outcomes and risks. This article reviews the historic use of concepts and terms to describe populations disproportionately impacted by emergencies.

In radiation therapy (RT), professional and social interactions are highly important to maintaining team culture and effective patient care. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is also an integral part of maintaining professional and personal competence and growth for healthcare professionals. This article examines the rationale for and methods of swiftly adapting a robust CPD program and training calendar to an online offering for radiation therapists (RTs) at the Princess Alexandra Hospital Radiation Oncology Department, Brisbane, Australia. Reasons for the change, how it was achieved quickly, and the opportunity to build resilience in the staff group are discussed. Successes and challenges of achieving meaningful change in a short timeframe are described, ensuring RTs maintained access to both CPD and social support during the crisis.

This study hypothesized that IFR would be influenced by COVID-19 epidemic intensity. We tested the association between epidemic intensity and IFR using serological results from a recent large SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey (N = 60,983) in 19 Spanish regions. The infection fatality rate for Spain as a whole was 1.15% and varied between 0.13% and 3.25% in the regions (median 1.07%, IQR 0.69–1.32%). The IFR by region was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (rho = 0.54; p = 0.0162), cases/100,000 (rho = 0.75; p = 0.002), hospitalizations/100,000 (rho = 0.78; p = 0.0001), mortality/100,000 (rho = 0.77; p = 0.0001) and case fatality rate (rho = 0.49; p = 0.0327). These results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 IFR is not fixed. The Spanish regions with more rapid and extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2 had higher IFRs. These findings are compatible with the theory that slowing the spread of COVID-19 down reduces the IFR and case fatality rate via preventing hospitals from being overrun, and thus allowing better and lifesaving care.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32560071/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9060128";16/6/2020;infection fatality rate;0.9307

Early speculation was that the virus may have been circulating from at least January [1], and environmental sampling suggests that versions of this virus were found months before the first human samples were identified [2]. Here we performed a retrospective study from residual samples collected from a global respiratory surveillance effort to establish a tentative timeline by which this virus was circulating in the US military population. We performed RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2 and compared the dates of these cases to the first cases identified in respective states and counties using the Johns Hopkins COVID tracker website. Twenty-four positive samples were identified out of approximately 7,000 tested. Although we found some early cases in certain regions, we did not see circulation before late February in samples collected both in the US and outside the USA.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251368v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.18.21251368";20/2/2021;RT-PCR;0.9307
1412;COVID-19 as an Acute Inflammatory Disease.;10.4049/jimmunol.2000413;The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created an unprecedented global crisis for the infrastructure sectors, including economic, political, healthcare, education, and research systems. Although over 90% of infected individuals are asymptomatic or manifest noncritical symptoms and will recover from the infection, those individuals presenting with critical symptoms are in urgent need of effective treatment options. Emerging data related to mechanism of severity and potential therapies for patients presenting with severe symptoms are scattered and therefore require a comprehensive analysis to focus research on developing effective therapeutics. A critical literature review suggests that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with dysregulation of inflammatory immune responses, which in turn inhibits the development of protective immunity to the infection. Therefore, the use of therapeutics that modulate inflammation without compromising the adaptive immune response could be the most effective therapeutic strategy.;"https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32423917/";18/5/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9774

Here, we developed an innovative interaction screening strategy based on phase separation in cellulo, namely compartmentalization of protein-protein interactions in cells (CoPIC). Utilizing CoPIC screening, we mapped the interaction network among RTC-related viral proteins. We identified a total of 47 binary interactions among 14 proteins governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses. Further exploration via CoPIC led to the discovery of extensive ternary complexes composed of these components, which infer potential higher-order complexes. Taken together, our results present an efficient, and robust interaction screening strategy, and indicate the existence of a complex interaction network among RTC-related factors, thus opening up new opportunities to understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and develop therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.26.424422;26/12/2020;therapeutic interventions;0.9201

However, the function of LECT2 in osteoporosis still remains exploration, which encourages us to lucubrate its functional effect in regulating the OD of MSCs. In this study, we found that LECT2 was expressed at low level in MSCs with osteogenic differentiation, and knockdown of LECT2 would activate Wnt/β-catenin pathway and therefore promoting OD in MSCs.

The Italian vaccination Law (n. 119/2017) reinforced mandates for polio, diphtheria, tetanus, and hepatitis B, extending the mandate to pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella, for children up to 16 years of age. We analyzed the national temporal trends of childhood immunization rates from 2014 to 2019 to evaluate the impact of the mandatory reinforcement law set in 2017 as a sustainable public health strategy in Italy. In a 3-year period, 9 of the 10 compulsory vaccinations reached the threshold of 95% and VC for chicken pox increased up to 90.5%, significantly. During the same period, the recommended vaccinations (against meningococcus B and C, pneumococcus, and rotavirus) also recorded a significant increase in VC trends.

Here, a facile in situ molecularly soldered strategy was developed to fabricate defect-free ultrathin COF membranes with precise sieving abilities using the typical chemical environment for COF condensation polymerization and dopamine self-polymerization. The experimental data and density functional theory simulations proved that the reactive oxygen species generated during dopamine polymerization catalyze the nucleophilic reactions of the COF, thus facilitating the counter-diffusion growth of thin COF layers. Notably, dopamine can eliminate the defects in the stacked COF by soldering the COF crystals, fortifying the mechanical properties of the ultrathin COF membranes. The COF membranes exhibited ultrafast precision sieving for molecular separation and ion removal in both aqueous and organic solvents, which surpasses that of state-of-the-art membranes.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762342/; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abe8706";24/3/2021;covalent organic framework;0.9802

Responding to medical emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19 will require new guidelines and protocols. Simulation can support their development. METHODS We organised seven simulations involving patients with suspected COVID-19 for staff at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals. Participants completed pre- and post-simulation questionnaires. RESULTS Fifty-six staff participated and they reported being significantly less prepared to respond to an emergency in a patient with suspected COVID-19 than in one in whom it is not suspected. The simulations significantly improved the participants' confidence in responding to emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19. Numerous challenges were identified along the themes of equipment, personnel, communication and procedures.

The mortality in ARDS due to coronavirus disease (COVID) 2019 among mechanically ventilated patients is 50% or less, and it has improved over time from 42 to 25% [2, 3]. The mortality in the current study's control arm (43%) was worse than the mortality in the control arm of the RECOVERY trial (26%) [4]. The survival difference between the two study groups may be due to the better supportive care provided to the intervention arm due to the trial's unblinded nature. Also, the justification provided for the sample size is inadequate. The authors have cited studies using methylprednisolone in asthma, COPD, and pre-operative patients as references for the sample size calculation.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509962/; https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00065-2021";28/1/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9751
1426;Systemic hypoxia inhibits T cell response by limiting mitobiogenesis via matrix substrate-level phosphorylation arrest;10.7554/elife.56612;Systemic oxygen restriction (SOR) is prevalent in numerous clinical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections. However, the influence of SOR on T cell immunity remains uncharacterized. Here we show the detrimental effect of hypoxia on mitochondrial-biogenesis in activated mouse CD8(+) T cells. We find that low oxygen level diminishes CD8(+) T cell anti-viral response in vivo. We reveal that respiratory restriction inhibits ATP-dependent matrix processes that are critical for mitochondrial-biogenesis. This respiratory restriction-mediated effect could be rescued by TCA cycle re-stimulation, which yielded increased mitochondrial matrix-localized ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrate that the hypoxia-arrested CD8(+) T cell anti-viral response could be rescued in vivo through brief exposure to atmospheric oxygen pressure. Overall, these findings elucidate the detrimental effect of hypoxia on mitochondrial-biogenesis in activated CD8(+) T cells, and suggest a new approach for reducing viral infections in COPD.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7728436/;23/11/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9572

The open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein is a newly discovered non-structural protein in PCV2, which the function in viral pathogenesis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of PCV2 ORF5 protein on autophagy and viral replication. The pEGFP-tagged ORF5 gene was ectopic expressed in PK-15 cells and an ORF5-deficient PCV2 mutant strain (PCV2(ΔORF5)) were used to infected PK-15 cells. This study demonstrated that the ORF5 is essential for the of PCV2-induced autophagy. The ORF5 protein triggers the phosphorylation of PERK, eIF2α and the expression of downstream transcription factor ATF4. In addition, ORF5 protein activated the AMPK-ERK1/2-mTOR signaling pathways. These findings suggest that ORF5 play essential roles in the induction of autophagy by PCV2. We further revealed that PCV2 ORF5 promotes viral replication through PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 and AMPK-ERK1/2-mTOR pathways. In conclusion, we showed that PCV2 ORF5 induces autophagy to promote virus replication in PK-15 cells.;"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32184774/";28/2/2020;porcine circovirus-associated disease;0.96

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is one of the most common complications of the COVID-19 infection. The activation of the coagulation system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. The development of lung coagulopathy involves thrombin generation and fibrinolysis inhibition. Unfractionated heparin and its recently introduced counterpart low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), are widely used anticoagulants with a variety of clinical indications allowing for limited and manageable physio-toxicologic side effects while the use of protamine sulfate, heparin's effective antidote, has made their use even safer. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is approved as intravenous thrombolytic treatment. The present narrative review discusses the use of heparin and tPA in the treatment of COVID-19-induced ARDS and their related potential physio-toxicologic side effects.

Senior nursing students saw the elimination of in-person clinical opportunities in the final months prior to graduation as health care facilities restricted access to essential personnel in an effort to minimize transmission of the virus and conserve personal protective equipment. METHOD To fulfill course requirements, faculty created a COVID-19 assignment that implored students to research the most current infection control recommendations for COVID-19 and to describe the impacts of the virus on nursing care, patients, families, interdisciplinary collaboration, and public safety. RESULTS The COVID-19 assignment fostered clinical reasoning and encouraged personal reflection with application to practice. Students reported that the assignment greatly enhanced knowledge and awareness of COVID-19. CONCLUSION This assignment was beneficial for transition to practice in the midst of a pandemic, and it can be easily replicated for any future emerging health care topic that may affect nursing education.

We measured the percentage of severe acute respiratory syndrome- Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositive individuals from 2,008 blood donors drawn in the state of Rhode Island (RI). We utilized multiple antibody testing platforms, including lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). We report than an estimated seropositive rate of RI blood donors of approximately 0.6% existed in April-May of 2020. These data imply that seroconversion, and thus infection, is likely not widespread within this population. Daily new case rates peaked in RI in late April 2020. We conclude that IgG LFAs and HTSAs are suitable to conduct seroprevalence assays in random populations. More studies will be needed using validated serological tests to improve the precision and report the kinetic progression of seroprevalence estimates.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.20157743v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.20157743";26/7/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9932

1433;Severe COVID-19: understanding the role of immunity, endothelium, and coagulation in clinical practice;10.1590/1677-5449.200131;SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The immune system is a determinant factor in defense against viral infections. Thus, when it acts in a balanced and effective manner the disease is self-limited and benign. Nevertheless, in a significant proportion of the population, the immune response is exaggerated. When infected, patients with diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular disease are more likely to progress to severe forms. These diseases are related to chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Toll-like receptors are expressed on immune cells and play an important role in the physiopathology of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. When activated, they can induce release of inflammatory cytokines. Hypercoagulability, hyperinflammation, platelet hyperresponsiveness, and endothelial dysfunction occur in immune system hyperactivity caused by viral activity, thereby increasing the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis. We discuss the interactions between COVID-19, immunity, the endothelium, and coagulation, as well as why cardiometabolic diseases have a negative impact on COVID-19 prognosis.;"https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.200131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34211530/";16/11/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9043

Although South Korea has drastically reduced the number of new confirmed cases and is stabilizing the situation with its exemplary disease prevention policies, there remains a problem. These are cases that had shown negative results to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (gene amplification) tests as the COVID-19 virus had become undetectable but turned re-positive after a short period. The Central Clinical Committee determined that these re-positive cases after COVID-19 viral clearance are due to the limits of the test method; it is considered that the genetic material of the “dead virus” remaining in a recovered patient’s body is amplified during the test process. Comprehending the above evidence, re-positive cases of COVID-19 are not infectious; the virus is not even reactivated.

In the absence of any vaccine, various mitigation measures were used. In the past, the effect of temperature and humidity on the spread of the virus was studied for a very early phase of the data with mixed results. We are studying the impact of COVID-19 on the maximum temperature and relative humidity of a place using Indian states as test cases for SIR, SIRD, and SEIR models. We used a linear regression method to look for any dependency between effective reproduction number with maximum temperature and relative humidity. Most of the states show a correlation with the negative slope between the effective reproduction number with the maximum temperature and the relative humidity. It indicates that the effective reproduction number goes down as maximum temperature or relative humidity rise.

1448;An Embedded ANN Raspberry PI for Inertial Sensor Based Human Activity Recognition;10.1007/978-3-030-51517-1_34;Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is one of the critical subjects of research in health and human machine interaction fields in recent years. Algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Decision Tree (DT) and many other algorithms were previously implemented to serve this common goal but most of the traditional Machine learning proposed solutions were not satisfying in term of accuracy and real time testing process. For that, a human activities analysis and recognition system with an embedded trained ANN model on Raspberry PI for an online testing process is proposed in this work. This paper includes a comparative study between the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), using signals produced by the accelerometer and gyroscope, embedded within the BlueNRG-Tile sensor. After evaluate algorithms performance in terms of accuracy and precision which reached an accuracy of 82% for ANN and 99% for RNN, obtained ANN model was implemented in a Raspberry PI for real-time predictions. Results show that the system provides a real-time human activity recognition with an accuracy of 86%.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313300/;31/5/2020;Human Activity Recognition;0.9413

Hypoandrogenism and hyperandrogenism in males and females, respectively, are associated with the prevalence of metabolic disorders. Our recent work showed that male androgen receptor knockout (ARKO) mice developed high-fat diet (HFD)-dependent sarcopenic abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis, leading to early death. The ARKO mice also exhibited alterations in intestinal microbiota but did not experience metabolic abnormalities when administered with antibiotics. Here, we show that time-dependent changes in feed efficiency (ratio of body weight gain to food intake) and weight of dried feces-to-food ratio could be good markers for changes in gut microbiota. Turicibacter spp., Lactobacillus spp., and L. reuteri increased in the gut in both HFD-fed ARKO and castrated mice having metabolic abnormalities. HFD-fed ARKO mice showed increased plasma levels of aspartate, but not alanine, aminotransferase. Changes in the gut microbiome appear to provoke androgen deficiency-induced metabolic diseases, leading to early mortality.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2020.1817719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991827/";9/11/2020;high-fat diet;0.9454
1450;Diurnal preference and depressive symptomatology: a meta-analysis;10.1038/s41598-021-91205-3;Eveningness, a preference for later sleep and rise times, has been associated with a number of negative outcomes in terms of both physical and mental health. A large body of evidence links eveningness to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, to date, evidence quantifying this association is limited. The current meta-analysis included 43 effect sizes from a total 27,996 participants. Using a random-effects model it was demonstrated that eveningness is associated with a small effect size (Fisher’s Z = − 2.4, 95% CI [− 0.27. − 0.21], p < 0.001). Substantial heterogeneity between studies was observed, with meta-regression analyses demonstrating a significant effect of mean age on the association between diurnal preference and depression. There was also evidence of potential publication bias as assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger’s test. The association between diurnal preference and depression is small in magnitude and heterogenous.

A theoretical framework is required in order to understand this impact and strategies to mitigate it. In this paper, individual and community responses to COVID-19 are discussed from the point of view of attachment theory, a psychological theory which examines the formation and disruption of attachment bonds across the life-span from an evolutionary perspective. The contributions of this perspective to individual psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress, as well as to social responses such as interpersonal violence and stigmatization, are discussed in the light of findings from attachment research. Proposals for incorporating the knowledge derived from attachment theory into therapeutic strategies, as well as in developing community resilience in the face of COVID-19, are discussed based on the available evidence. It is hoped that this information will be of value to clinicians and researchers, as well as to those involved in planning health services and social policy.;"https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796795/";1/1/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9557
1454;Role of dopamine and gray matter density in aging effects and individual differences of functional connectomes.;10.1007/s00429-020-02205-4;With increasing age, functional connectomes become dissimilar across normal individuals, reflecting heterogenous aging effects on functional connectivity (FC). We investigated the distribution of these effects across the connectome and their relationship with age-related differences in dopamine (DA) D1 receptor availability and gray matter density (GMD). With this aim, we determined aging effects on mean and interindividual variance of FC using fMRI in 30 younger and 30 older healthy subjects and mapped the contribution of each connection to the patterns of age-related similarity loss. Aging effects on mean FC accounted mainly for the dissimilarity between connectomes of younger and older adults, and were related, across brain regions, to aging effects on DA D1 receptor availability. Aging effects on the variance of FC indicated a global increase in variance with advancing age, explained connectome dissimilarity among older subjects and were related to aging effects on variance of GMD. The relationship between aging and the similarity of connectomes can thus be partly explained by age differences in DA modulation and gray matter structure.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-020-02205-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423111/";9/1/2021;gray matter density;0.994

There were restricted services in several hospitals for minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, hospitals could not provide adequate transitional care that possibly resulted in poor post-discharge outcomes in patients. Some hospitals have now combined infection prevention with face-to-face opportunities, i.e., requiring reservations for transitional care consultation and restricting pre-discharge conferences. Several hospitals started providing pre-discharge conferences using apps, where patients/family caregivers and care teams could have face-to-face discussions about medical and nursing care plans, goals, and preferences. However, building a relationship between patient/family and medical/nursing staff and providing decision-making, psychological support, and risk assessment generally performed in person are still in demand.

ACE2 is expressed in many human tissues, including the lungs. However, no research has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect human breast tissue. This study aimed to investigate ACE2 gene expression in human breast tissue using a public database. Materials and Methods A search of a public gene expression database was performed to investigate ACE2 gene expression in in human breast tissue. Results The gene expression profile demonstrated that ACE2 gene expression was higher in human breast tissue than human lung tissue. Conclusion Our knowledge about coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is expanding rapidly. Clinicians are eager for vetted information regarding all aspects of this new illness, and this study demonstrates that the level of ACE2 expression in human breast tissue is higher than that in the lung tissue, a major target tissue affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The optimization parameter space that includes the capillary tube geometries and the heater sizes of DH-cPCR is established, and a database consisting of nearly 10,000 CFD simulations is constructed. The database is then used to train a two-stage ANN models that select practically relevant data for modeling and predict PCR device performance. The trained ANN model is then combined with the gradient-based and the heuristics optimization approaches to search for optimal device configuration that possesses the shortest DNA doubling time. The entire design process including model meshing and configuration, parallel CFD computation, database organization, and ANN training and utilization is fully automated. Case studies confirm that the proposed framework can successfully find the optimal device configuration with an error of less than 0.3 s, and hence, representing a cost-effective and rapid solution of DH-cPCR device design.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33782743/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10544-021-00551-6";29/3/2021;computational fluid dynamics;0.9619

We sought to assess the potential of five validated herbal extracts regarding their ability to restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro: Bronchipret thyme-ivy (BRO TI), Bronchipret thyme-primrose (BRO TP), Imupret (IMU), Sinupret extract (SINx) and Tonsipret (TOP). METHODS: Vero cells were incubated with different concentrations of herbal extracts and infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 48 hours. The inhibition of viral replication was assessed by determination of the viral RNA load in the cell culture supernatant using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was reduced by non-cytotoxic concentrations of BRO-TP (up to approximately 1,000-fold) and, to a lesser extent, IMU and TOP (approximately 10-fold). CONCLUSIONS: Some herbal extracts showed a promising in vitro effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an antiviral potential of herbal medicinal products.

Recent literature has shown the association between COVID-19 infection and derangement in the coagulation profile. In this paper, we are discussing thrombo-genesis, especially the role of the complement system in the immune response against COVID-19 and the pathogenesis associated with tissue inflammation and thrombosis. This role can stipulate a groundwork for further investigation of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could propose targets for specific intervention. In addition, we delineated current treatments for thrombosis and the potential therapies by using agents to block the terminal complement pathway. Low molecular weight heparin for all (unless contraindicated) hospitalized COVID-19 patients can be lifesaving. Agents that inhibit the terminal events of the complement cascade might be crucial for ensuring an efficient treatment, decrease clots and permit early discharge in relation to COVID-19.

We conducted phone surveys with 726 randomly selected village informants across seven rural Chinese provinces in February 2020. Four villages (0.55%) reported infections, and none reported deaths. Disease control measures had been universally implemented in all sample villages. About 74% of informants reported that villagers with wage‐earning jobs outside the village had stopped working due to workplace closures. A higher percentage of rural individuals could not work due to transportation, housing, and other constraints. Local governments had taken measures to reduce the impact of COVID‐19. Although schools in all surveyed villages were closed, 71% of village informants reported that students were attending classes online.

1465;Homo-harringtonine (HHT) – A highly effective drug against coronaviruses and the potential for large-scale clinical applications;10.1101/2021.04.16.440104;In the search for treatment schemes of COVID-19, we start by examining the general weakness of coronaviruses and then identify approved drugs attacking that weakness. The approach, if successful, should identify drugs with a specific mechanism that is at least as effective as the best drugs proposed and are ready for clinical trials. All coronaviruses translate their non-structural proteins (∼16) in concatenation, resulting in a very large super-protein. Homo-harringtonine (HHT), which has been approved for the treatment of leukemia, blocks protein elongation very effectively. Hence, HHT can repress the replication of many coronaviruses at the nano-molar concentration. In two mouse models, HHT clears SARS-CoV-2 in 3 days, especially by nasal dripping of 40 ug per day. We also use dogs to confirm the safety of HHT delivered by nebulization. The nebulization scheme could be ready for large-scale applications at the onset of the next epidemics. For the current COVID-19, a clinical trial has been approved by the Ditan hospital of Beijing but could not be implemented for want of patients.

The disease can lead to serious problems, like pneumonia or even death especially among vulnerable people with existing health conditions. Its treatment and management require huge efforts from medical professionals often at the cost of their own health and life. Nutrition is the epicenter for the management of such diseases which works synergistically with the medical treatment for quick and better recovery. It has been associated with great human and economic toll and it is still not contained. Currently over two million people are affected and over 300,000 deaths globally. However, due to its newness and unfamiliarity, the understanding of this novel virus is still evolving. This viral infection poses numerous metabolic challenges to those severely affected and addressing them is a key to better outcomes.

In addition to playing an important role in suppressing transmission, NPIs influence pathogen evolution by mediating mutation supply and altering the strength of selection for novel variants. However, it is unclear how NPIs might affect the emergence of novel variants of concern that are able to escape pre-existing immunity (partially or fully), are more transmissible, or cause greater mortality. Here, we analyse a stochastic two-strain epidemiological model to determine how the strength of NPIs affects the emergence of variants with similar or contrasting life-history characteristics to the wildtype. We show that, while stronger and timelier NPIs generally reduce the likelihood of variant emergence, it is possible for more transmissible variants with high cross immunity to have a greater probability of emerging at intermediate levels of NPIs. However, since one cannot predict the characteristics of a variant, the best strategy to prevent emergence is likely to be implementation of strong, timely NPIs.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.27.21257938v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.27.21257938";28/5/2021;Non-pharmaceutical interventions;0.918
1471;Frailty variation models for susceptibility and exposure to SARS-CoV-2;10.1101/2021.05.25.21257766;"Individual variation in susceptibility and exposure is subject to selection by force of infection, accelerating the natural acquisition of immunity, and reducing herd immunity thresholds and epidemic final sizes. This is a manifestation of a wider population phenomenon known as ""frailty variation"" in demography. Despite this theoretical understanding, public health policies continue to be guided by mathematical models that leave out most of the relevant variation and as a result inflate projected infection burdens. Here we focus on the trajectories of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in England and Scotland. We fit models to series of daily deaths and estimate relevant epidemiological parameters, including coefficients of variation which we find in agreement with direct measurements based on published contact surveys. Our estimates are robust to whether the data series encompass one or two pandemic waves. We conclude that herd immunity thresholds are being reached with a larger contribution of vaccination in Scotland than in England, where naturally acquired immunity is higher. These results are relevant to global vaccination policies.";"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.25.21257766v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.25.21257766";26/5/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9488
1472;COVID‐19 pandemic cybersecurity issues;10.1002/itl2.247;This paper studies the cybersecurity issues that have occurred during the coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic. During the pandemic, cyber criminals and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups have taken advantage of targeting vulnerable people and systems. This paper emphasizes that there is a correlation between the pandemic and the increase in cyber‐attacks targeting sectors that are vulnerable. In addition, the growth in anxiety and fear due to the pandemic is increasing the success rate of cyber‐attacks. We also highlight that healthcare organizations are one of the main victims of cyber‐attacks during the pandemic. The pandemic has also raised the issue of cybersecurity in relation to the new normal of expecting staff to work from home (WFH), the possibility of state‐sponsored attacks, and increases in phishing and ransomware. We have also provided various practical approaches to reduce the risks of cyber‐attacks while WFH including mitigation of security risks related to healthcare. It is crucial that healthcare organizations improve protecting their important data and assets by implementing a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7675576/;14/10/2020;coronavirus;0.9984
1473;The Essential Facts of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in China and Epitope-based Vaccine Designing against COVID-19;10.1101/2020.02.05.935072;Wuhan Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading. To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. Hopefully, this study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive treatment against this lethal virus.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.935072;6/3/2020;Wuhan Novel Coronavirus disease;0.9254
1474;Contact-Tracing-Apps als unterstützende Maßnahme bei der Kontaktpersonennachverfolgung von COVID-19;10.1055/a-1195-2474;Contact tracing is currently one of the most effective measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to identify persons that would otherwise not be known or remembered and to keep the time delay when reporting an infection and when contacting people as short as possible, digital contact tracing using smartphones seems to be a reasonable measure additional to manual contact tracing. Although first modelling studies predicted a positive effect in terms of prompt contact tracing, no empirically reliable data are as yet available, neither on the population-wide benefit nor on the potential risks of contact tracing apps. Risk-benefit assessment of such an app includes investigating whether such an app fulfils its purpose, as also research on the effectiveness, risks and side effects, and implementation processes (e. g. planning and inclusion of different participants). The aim of this article was to give an overview of possible public health benefits as well as technical, social, legal and ethical aspects of a contact-tracing app in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, conditions for the widest possible use of the app are presented.;"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1195-2474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32693420/";21/7/2020;Contact tracing;0.9001
1475;SARS-CoV-2 infection in an infant with non-respiratory manifestations: a case report;10.1186/s43054-020-00047-7;BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents in children usually with less severe manifestations than in adults. Although fever and cough were reported as the most common symptoms, children can have non-specific symptoms. We describe an infant with aplastic anemia as the main manifestation. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an infant without any respiratory symptoms or signs while manifesting principally with pallor and purpura. Pancytopenia with reticulocytopenia was the predominant feature in the initial laboratory investigations, pointing to aplastic anemia. Chest computed tomography surprisingly showed typical findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection was later confirmed by positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with COVID-19 can have non-specific manifestations and a high index of suspicion should be kept in mind especially in regions with a high incidence of the disease. Chest computed tomography (CT) and testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR may be considered even in the absence of respiratory manifestations.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7829658/;25/1/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9869
1476;Contour-aware semantic segmentation network with spatial attention mechanism for medical image;10.1007/s00371-021-02075-9;"Medical image segmentation is a critical and important step for developing computer-aided system in clinical situations. It remains a complicated and challenging task due to the large variety of imaging modalities and different cases. Recently, Unet has become one of the most popular deep learning frameworks because of its accurate performance in biomedical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a contour-aware semantic segmentation network, which is an extension of Unet, for medical image segmentation. The proposed method includes a semantic branch and a detail branch. The semantic branch focuses on extracting the semantic features from shallow and deep layers; the detail branch is used to enhance the contour information implied in the shallow layers. In order to improve the representation capability of the network, a MulBlock module is designed to extract semantic information with different receptive fields. Spatial attention module (CAM) is used to adaptively suppress the redundant features. In comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves a remarkable performance on several public medical image segmentation challenges.";"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-021-02075-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642659/";22/2/2021;Spatial attention module;0.9644

The aim of the paper is, based on an analysis of different aspects as a determinant of the choice of means of transport in the transfer of cars, to compare the individual modes of transport involved in the provision of logistic processes in automotive industry in the Slovak Republic. The main objective is to create a mathematical-statistical model. Model enables to simulate the required output effect (transport mode) on the basis of the change in the significance of the decision criteria, as well as to point out important factors and determinants influencing/selecting the means of transport and the mode of transport in this process with respect to the social-economic and environmental requirements in the context of sustainable development. The simulation consists of a sequence of steps that follow each other and depend on the decision method used.

1478;Factors affecting the access to health services among waste collectors in Hanoi, Vietnam: A qualitative study;10.3934/publichealth.2020039;BACKGROUND: Waste collection is a common practice in Vietnam. In general, the working and living conditions of waste collectors are poor. Thus, they might be exposed to occupational and environmental risk factors, which affect their health or could further exacerbate their health vulnerabilities. Moreover, they have difficulties to access to health services. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand factors affecting the access to health services among waste collectors in Hanoi, Vietnam. METHODS: The qualitative design was used for this study. A total of 30 in-depth interviews with waste collectors and 3 focused group discussions were conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2017. RESULTS: Findings showed the participants considered factors that affect the access to health services among waste collectors such as geographical accessibility, the availability of health facilities, the acceptance of the quality of health services, health insurance, and affordability.

1479;Machine Learning and Syncope Management in the ED: The Future Is Coming;10.3390/medicina57040351;In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been promisingly applied in many fields of clinical medicine, both for diagnosis and prognosis prediction. Aims of this narrative review were to summarize the basic concepts of ML applied to clinical medicine and explore its main applications in the emergency department (ED) setting, with a particular focus on syncope management. Through an extensive literature search in PubMed and Embase, we found increasing evidence suggesting that the use of ML algorithms can improve ED triage, diagnosis, and risk stratification of many diseases. However, the lacks of external validation and reliable diagnostic standards currently limit their implementation in clinical practice. Syncope represents a challenging problem for the emergency physician both because its diagnosis is not supported by specific tests and the available prognostic tools proved to be inefficient. ML algorithms have the potential to overcome these limitations and, in the future, they could support the clinician in managing syncope patients more efficiently. However, at present only few studies have addressed this issue, albeit with encouraging results.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57040351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33917508/";6/4/2021;emergency department;0.9574
1480;Public health response to COVID-19 in selected countries – Hits and misses;10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1482_20;BACKGROUND: Lack of a cure or vaccine of COVID-19 forced us to rely on public health interventions (PHIs) for combating the pandemic. The main objective of the study to assess the PHI in selected countries and relate the various factors related to the intervention with the case load of the country. METHODS: An ecological analysis was conducted using secondary data on PHIs and disease burden extracted from official documents and press releases of the respective countries. Disease transmission was described based on calculated doubling time. PHIs were classified into 14 categories within three domains. An intervention score was calculated to reflect the number and stringency of the PHIs. Correlations between intervention scores, daily new cases and doubling time were presented. RESULTS: Brazil and the USA had the lowest intervention scores while South Korea had the highest scores. The median doubling time was negatively correlated with the rapidity of the escalation of the PHIs. CONCLUSION: Dynamic government policies and timely PHIs, which are locally relevant and ably supported by the public are key to successful containment of the COVID-19 pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1482_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532398/";30/11/2020;Lack of a cure or vaccine;0.9281

We reasoned that a broadened temporal perspective may attenuate current mental distress and tested a letter‐writing manipulation designed to connect people to their post‐COVID‐19 future selves. We conducted an online experiment with 738 Japanese participants recruited from two common survey platforms. They were randomly assigned to either send a letter to their future self (letter‐to‐future) condition, send a letter to present self from the perspective of future self (letter‐from‐future) condition, or a control condition. Participants in both letter‐writing conditions showed immediate decrease in negative affect and increase in positive affect relative to the control condition. These effects were mediated by temporal distancing from the current situation. These findings suggest that taking a broader temporal perspective can be achieved by letter writing with a future self and may offer an effective means of regulating negative affect in a stressful present time such as the COVID‐19 pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595208/";17/2/2021;Novel coronavirus disease;0.9841
1482;Alpha‐defensins: risk factor for thrombosis in COVID‐19 infection;10.1111/bjh.17503;The inflammatory response to SARS/CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) infection may contribute to the risk of thromboembolic complications. α‐Defensins, antimicrobial peptides released from activated neutrophils, are anti‐fibrinolytic and prothrombotic in vitro and in mouse models. In this prospective study of 176 patients with COVID‐19 infection, we found that plasma levels of α‐defensins were elevated, tracked with disease progression/mortality or resolution and with plasma levels of interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) and D‐dimers. Immunohistochemistry revealed intense deposition of α‐defensins in lung vasculature and thrombi. IL‐6 stimulated the release of α‐defensins from neutrophils, thereby accelerating coagulation and inhibiting fibrinolysis in human blood, imitating the coagulation pattern in COVID‐19 patients. The procoagulant effect of IL‐6 was inhibited by colchicine, which blocks neutrophil degranulation. These studies describe a link between inflammation and the risk of thromboembolism, and they identify a potential new approach to mitigate this risk in patients with COVID‐19 and potentially in other inflammatory prothrombotic conditions.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34053084/; https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.17503";30/5/2021;SARS/CoV‐2;0.9295

For this reason, aiming to characterize how the software companies have been implemented DT, this paper presents the results of a survey answered by 127 professionals from the Brazilian software industry. The results report a variety of scenarios in which DT has been applied: more than ten different models (sets of steps) are followed by the professionals; more than 50 techniques have been used, mainly, for meeting the needs in the process, according to the context of use and based on previous experiences.

Five common transport media (four commercial and one in-house) were evaluated for their suitability in the collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens for subsequent molecular detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results suggest that these transport media provide dependable temporal stability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus without significant analytical interference of molecular assays. These findings are important for addressing critical laboratory supply chain shortages of transport media in the current COVID-19 health crisis but also for future pandemic planning, when again supplies of choice commercially-available transport media likely will be depleted.

PATIENTS AND METHODS In this multicentric descriptive study, surveys were distributed among 4 different Breast Cancer Centers (BCC). BCCs were distinguished according to COVID-19 tertiary care hospital (COVID/No-COVID) and district prevalence (DP) (High vs. Low). DASS-21 score, PSS score and demographic data (age, sex, work) were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 51 HCWs were analyzed in the study. Age, work and sex did not demonstrate statistically significant values. Statistically significant distribution was found between DASS-21-stress score and COVID/No-COVID (p=0.043). No difference was found in the remaining DASS-21 and PSS scores, dividing the HCWs according to COVID-19-hospital and DP. CONCLUSION Working in a COVID-19-hospital represents a factor that negatively affects psychosocial well-being. However, DP seems not to affect the psychosocial well-being of BCC HCWs.

1486;Shaping migration at the border: the entangled rationalities of border control practices;10.1186/s40878-020-00214-0;This article analyses how border guards as members of a state organisation shape the movement of non-nationals into the territory of a nation state. Based on ethnographic fieldwork on the Swiss Border Guard (SBG), it explores the rationalities—understood as stabilised ways of reasoning and acting—that characterise practices within this state organisation. Combining organisational and structuration theory with a street-level bureaucracy perspective allows for a differentiated analysis of the various facets of border guards’ everyday work. Four rationalities of border-control practices are identified and compared: security, humanitarian, cost-calculation, and pragmatic rationality. I argue that, by considering both the specific goals and imperatives of border control and the characteristics of street-level bureaucrats acting within a state organisation, these entangled logics explain the complex and incoherent social reality of border control. More generally, the results contribute to organisational theory by pointing to the importance of taking into account that multiple entangled rationalities structure the practices of an organisation’s members.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619453/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-020-00214-0";18/2/2021;Swiss Border Guard;0.9348

The whole world is working relentlessly to find some solutions to fight against this deadly virus to reduce the number of deaths. Strategic planning with predictive modelling and short term forecasting for analyzing the situations based on the worldwide available data allow us to realize the future exponential behaviour of the COVID-19 disease. Time series forecasting plays a vital role in developing an efficient forecasting model for a future prediction about the spread of this contagious disease. In this paper, the ARIMA (Auto regression integrated moving average) and Holt-Winters time series exponential smoothing are used to develop an efficient 20- days ahead short-term forecast model to predict the effect of COVID-19 epidemic. The modelling and forecasting are done with the publicly available dataset from Kaggle as a perspective to India and its five states such as Odisha, Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.

Current studies have documented that SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, can damage the male reproductive system in large part by inflammatory damage caused by a cytokine storm. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect the human testis directly and enter semen is controversial. Other adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproduction are also of concern and require comprehensive evaluation. Here, we analyze the invasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 in the testis and examine reported mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interferes with male reproduction. Long-term implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male reproduction are also discussed. It should be emphasized that although COVID-19 may induce testicular damage, a substantial decrease in male reproductive capacity awaits clinical evidence. We propose that there is an urgent need to track male COVID-19 patients during their recovery. The development of suitable experimental models, including human reproductive organoids, will be valuable to further investigate the viral impact on reproduction for current and future pandemics.;"https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-20-0523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434886/";1/2/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.9164

In this review, we discuss the implications of school closures in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Modeling studies of the effects of school closures, largely derived from the pandemic influenza model, on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 produced conflicting results. Earlier studies assessed the risk of school reopening by modeling transmission across schools and communities; however, it remains unclear whether the risk is due to increased transmission in adults or children. The empirical findings of the impact of school closures on COVID-19 outbreaks suggest no clear effect, likely because of heterogeneity in community infection pressure, differences in school closure strategies, or the use of multiple interventions. The benefits of school closings are unclear and not readily quantifiable; however, they must be weighed against the potential high social costs, which can also negatively affect the health of this generation.";"https://doi.org/10.3345/cep.2021.00353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082502/";31/5/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9927

In this study of 28 European countries during the first wave of epidemic we demonstrate a significant inverse correlation between the stringency of adopted containment measures and cumulative incidences of the confirmed COVID-19 cases. Our results indicate that early implementation of the stringent containment measures prior to detection of the first confirmed case, and rapid ramp-up of containment stringency after the first case was diagnosed, were instrumental for lowering the number of COVID-19 cases during the epidemic wave. The impact of delayed adoption of containment measures could not be fully attenuated by later adoption of even more stringent community containment.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.21250501; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250501v1?rss=1";29/1/2021;Non-pharmaceutical interventions;0.9687

The sensor based on hydrothermal synthesis of vanadium disulfide quantum dots (VS2 QDs) and insertion within 3D N, S graphene aerogel (3D N, S @ GNA) and carbon nanotubes nanaostructure as a new and widely group of carbon nanomaterials. The nanocomposites were characterized morphologically using different techniques. In addition, the nanomaterials were characterized electrochemically using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The proposed electrochemical sensor showed wide dynamic linear ranges of 0.28-30×10-8 M and 0.84-22.5×10-8 M for analysis of AZM and HCQ, respectively. The limits of detection (LODs) based on signal to noise (S/N) 3:1 were found to be 0.091×10-8 M and 0.277 ×10-8 M for AZM and HCQ, respectively. Briefly, the electrochemical sensor had good stability, selectivity, reproducibility and feasibility for simultaneous detection of AZM and HCQ in presence of different interfering species.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026265X21000084?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437097/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2021.105925; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026265X21000084";8/1/2021;hydroxychloroquine;0.9529
1495;How Do Instant Messages Reduce Psychological Withdrawal Behaviors?—Mediation of Engagement and Moderation of Self-Control;10.3390/ijerph18062983;Enabling people to send and receive short text-based messages in real-time, instant messaging (IM) is a communication technology that allows instantaneous information exchanges. The development of technology makes IM communication widely adopted in the workplace, which brings a series of changes for modern contemporary working life. Based on the conservation of resource theory (COR), this paper explores the mechanism of workplace IM communication on employees’ psychological withdrawal, and investigates the mediating role of work engagement in the relationship and the moderating role of self-control. Using the experience sampling method (ESM), a 10-consecutive workdays daily study was conducted among 66 employees. By data analysis of 632 observations using SPSS and HLM, results found that: (1) IM demands had a positive relation with emotion and cognitive engagement. (2) Emotion and cognitive engagement were negatively correlated with psychological withdrawal. (3) Emotion and cognitive engagement mediated the relations of IM demands and psychological withdrawal. (4) Self-control moderated the relationship between emotional engagement and psychological withdrawal.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7999327/;14/3/2021;conservation of resource theory;0.9722

MATERIALS AND METHODS Detailed national epidemiological information of COVID-19 was retracted from the latest statistics reports from China, Italy, and South Korea. Population-based analysis of the age distribution among confirmed cases was conducted and their crude case fatality ratio in each c RESULTS: The age distributions among COVID-19 cases were relatively similar between China and Italy with primarily elderly populations infected, which were considerably different from that in South Korea with primarily younger individuals infected. Most deaths occurred among elderly individuals who were older than 60 years in both Italy (98.0%) and South Korea (87.9%), consistent with the previous data from China (81.0%). CONCLUSIONS Most deaths occurred among elderly individuals who were over 60 in China, Italy, and South Korea.

This article presents a conceptual framework for telehealth strategies that can be adopted to increase family involvement across a four-stage continuum of youth OUD treatment and recovery: Treatment Preparation, Treatment Initiation, Treatment Stabilization, OUD Recovery. It first identifies provider-delivered tele-interventions that can enhance OUD services in each of the four stages, including family outreach, family engagement, family-focused intervention, and family-focused recovery maintenance. It then introduces several types of direct-to-family tele-supports that can be used to supplement provider-delivered interventions. These include both synchronous tele-supports (remote interactions that occur in real time) such as helplines, peer-to-peer coaching, and online support groups; and asynchronous tele-supports (communications that occur without participants being simultaneously present) such as automated text messaging, self-directed internet-based courses, and digital web support.";"https://doi.org/10.1111/jmft.12499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33760249/";24/3/2021;opioid use disorders;0.9073

We leverage the heterogeneity in state government preemption of city indoor dining closures, to estimate the impact of keeping indoor dining closed on COVID-19 incidence. Methods: We obtained case rates and city/state re-opening dates from March to October 2020 in 11 U.S. cities. We categorized cities as (treatment) cities that were allowed by the state to reopen but kept indoor dining closed; and (comparison) cities that would have kept indoor dining closed but were preempted by their state and had to reopen indoor dining. Results: Keeping indoor dining closed was associated with a 43% (IRR=0.57, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.69) decline in COVID-19 incidence over 4-weeks compared with cities that reopened indoor dining. These results were consistent after testing alternative modeling strategies. Conclusions: Keeping indoor dining closed contributes to reductions in COVID-19 spread.

1499;CovRadar: Continuously tracking and filtering SARS-CoV-2 mutations for molecular surveillance;10.1101/2021.02.03.429146;Summary The ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of molecular surveillance to understand the evolution of the virus and to monitor and plan the epidemiological responses. Quick analysis, easy visualization and convenient filtering of the latest viral sequences are essential for this purpose. We present CovRadar, a tool for molecular surveillance of the Corona spike protein. The spike protein contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that is used as a target for most vaccine candidates. CovRadar consists of a workflow pipeline and a web application that enable the analysis and visualization of over 1 million sequences. First, CovRadar extracts the regions of interest using local alignment, then builds a multiple sequence alignment, infers variants, consensus sequences and phylogenetic trees and finally presents the results in an interactive PDF-like app, making reporting fast, easy and flexible. Availability and implementation CovRadar is freely accessible at https://covradar.net, its open-source code is available at https://gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/covradar.

1500;Severe underestimation of COVID-19 case numbers: effect of epidemic growth rate and test restrictions;10.1101/2020.04.13.20064220;"To understand the scope and development of the COVID-19 pandemic, knowledge of the number of infected persons is essential. Often, the number of ""confirmed cases"", which is based on positive RT-PCR test results, is regarded as a reasonable indicator. However, limited COVID-19 test capacities in many countries are restricting the amount of testing that can be done. This can lead to the implementation of testing policies that restrict access to COVID-19 tests, and to testing backlogs and delays. As a result, confirmed case numbers can be significantly lower than the actual number of infections, especially during rapid growth phases of the epidemic. This study examines the quantitative relation between infections and reported confirmed case numbers for two different testing strategies, ""limited"" and ""inclusive"" testing, in relation to the growth rate of the epidemic. The results indicate that confirmed case numbers understate the actual number of infections substantially; during rapid growth phases where the daily growth rate can reach or exceed 30%, as has been seen in many countries, the confirmed case numbers under-report actual infections by up to 50 to 100-fold.";https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20064220;17/4/2020;knowledge of the number of infected persons;0.9072

1502;Public Transport Operations After Lockdown: How to Make It Happen?;10.1007/s41403-020-00121-x;Lockdown in cities across the globe has imposed severe travel restrictions to limit the spread of Coronavirus disease. The travel behavior and operations will not be the same as before due to requirements such as physical (social) distancing. This study analyzes the resulting shortage in supply of public transport (buses) that will likely widen the existing gap between demand and supply. In this work, system optimization models are developed to efficiently reallocate the bus fleet to routes for different levels of physical distancing gaps and travel demand. The proposed models are applied to a real-life network of 34 bus routes of Delhi, considering three types of scenarios: current, practical, and ideal. In the practical scenarios, the additional, idling bus fleets can be allocated to the routes efficiently while maintaining physical distancing. The results show that the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario involving the current allocation approach will make it impossible to use public buses even if the bare minimum physical distancing has to be maintained. Further, the models proposed in the study significantly improve the key performance indicators for all scenarios.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290149/;12/6/2020;Business-as-Usual;0.956

The recent advances in NLP technologies are enabling rapid analysis of vast amounts of text, thereby creating opportunities for health research and evidence-informed decision making. The analysis and data extraction from scientific literature, technical reports, health records, social media, surveys, registries and other documents can support core public health functions including the enhancement of existing surveillance systems (e.g. through faster identification of diseases and risk factors/at-risk populations), disease prevention strategies (e.g. through more efficient evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of interventions) and health promotion efforts (e.g. by providing the ability to obtain expert-level answers to any health related question). NLP is emerging as an important tool that can assist public health authorities in decreasing the burden of health inequality/inequity in the population.

1505;Large-scale screening of COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia using infection size-aware classification.;10.1088/1361-6560/abe838;The worldwide spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a threatening risk for global public health. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately screen patients with COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this study, a total of 1658 patients with COVID-19 and 1027 CAP patients underwent thin-section CT. All images were preprocessed to obtain the segmentations of infections and lung fields. A set of handcrafted location-specific features was proposed to best capture the COVID-19 distribution pattern, in comparison to conventional CT severity score (CT-SS) and Radiomics features. An infection Size Aware Random Forest method (iSARF) was used for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method yielded best performance when using the handcrafted features with sensitivity of 91.6%, specificity of 86.8%, and accuracy of 89.8% over state-of-the-art classifiers. Additional test on 734 subjects with thick slice images demonstrates great generalizability. It is anticipated that our proposed framework could assist clinical decision making.

1506;IgM nephropathy complicated by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: a case study.;10.1186/s12882-020-02048-5;BACKGROUND IgM nephropathy is a rare disease with variable clinical presentations and is an unusual cause of nephrotic syndrome. Histopathological findings typically include mesangial hypercellularity with IgM and complement deposition, though the spectrum may range from normal glomeruli through to focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. Thromboembolism is a well recognised complication of nephrotic syndrome, but cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is rarely described. CASE PRESENTATION This is the case of a 23-year-old male presenting with the nephrotic syndrome, whose initial renal biopsy was consistent with minimal change disease. Complete remission was achieved with prednisone, however multiple relapses and steroid dependence prompted re-biopsy, the results of which were more consistent with IgM nephropathy. His last relapse was complicated by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. He then received rituximab and a weaning course of prednisone to again enter remission. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the need to consider IgM nephropathy in the differential diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Additionally, it emphasises the risk of thrombosis in patients with severe nephrosis.;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-020-02048-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894094/";7/9/2020;IgM nephropathy;0.9581

The management of patients with these diseases involves dental care to reduce systemic complications caused by odontogenic infections, and/or to treat oral manifestations of systemic comorbidities. In this regard, the dental care of these individuals must be guaranteed during the pandemic. Although a high risk of exposure to and catching of COVID-19 is expected to befall dental professionals, biosafety guidelines reduce the likelihood of infection. Thus, the current scenario poses challenges, and offers decision-making approaches and tools that facilitate the management of individuals with oral manifestations of chronic and/or critical diseases, using hospital-based services.

Methods: We used the Project for Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) tele-education model as an implementation strategy. We examined the number of clinicians newly waivered, the number of patients treated with buprenorphine, the relationship between clinician engagement with ECHO training and rates of buprenorphine prescribing, and treatment retention at 180 days. Results: The number of clinicians with a waiver and number of patients treated increased during and after ECHO training. There was a moderate correlation between the number of ECHO sessions attended by a clinician and number of their buprenorphine prescriptions (r = 0.50, p = 0.01). The 180-day retention rate was 80.7%. Conclusions: Project ECHO was highly effective for increasing access to this evidence-based treatment.

As with other infectious diseases that affect the respiratory tract, asthma has been cited as a potential risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, conflicting results have been published over the last few months and the putative association between these two diseases is still unproven. METHODS: Here, we systematically reviewed all reports on COVID-19 published since its emergence in December 2019 to June 30, 2020, looking into the description of asthma as a premorbid condition, which could indicate its potential involvement in disease progression. RESULTS: We found 372 articles describing the underlying diseases of 161,271 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Asthma was reported as a premorbid condition in only 2623 patients accounting for 1.6% of all patients. CONCLUSIONS: As the global prevalence of asthma is 4.4%, we conclude that either asthma is not a premorbid condition that contributes to the development of COVID-19 or clinicians and researchers are not accurately describing the premorbidities in COVID-19 patients.;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13223-020-00509-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33407838/";6/1/2021;Severe coronavirus disease-19;0.9669

Among other things, the author demonstrates that when properly benchmarked, the longevity-risk-adjusted global age of a 55-year-old Swedish male is 48, whereas a 55-year-old Russian male is closer in age to 67. The paper also discusses the connection between the proposed L-RaG age and the related concept of Biological age, from the medical and gerontology literature. Practically speaking, in a world of growing mortality heterogeneity, the L-RaG age could be used for pension and retirement policy. In the language of behavioral finance and economics, a salient metric that adjusts chronological age for longevity risk might help capture the public’s attention, educate them about lifetime uncertainty and induce many of them to take action — such as working longer and/or retiring later.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.insmatheco.2020.03.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167668720300445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834258/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167668720300445";11/4/2020;Human Mortality Database;0.963
1515;COVID-19 as Post-Migration Stress: Exploring the Impact of a Pandemic on Latinx Transgender Individuals in Immigration Detention;10.1007/978-3-030-61442-3_32;Transgender asylum-seeking individuals are often exposed to traumatic events in their country of origin, during the migratory journey, and post-migration. As a host country, the United States disproportionately targets Latinx migrants through persecutory anti-immigration, nativist laws, and xenophobia. Many Latinx transgender individuals with precarious immigration statuses must await decisions about their cases in immigration detention centers. Detention centers have been criticized for a host of health and physical safety threats, such as sexual assault by guards and other detainees, physical violence, and negligence resulting in death. Coronavirus (COVID-19) has had a substantial impact on the lives of Latinx transgender migrants in detention by amplifying pre-existing stressors. Among these challenges is the limited access to mental health care and psychological evaluations needed to treat and determine histories of trauma, depression, and acute stress in credible fear asylum cases. The resilience framework will be used to address shared trauma between Latinx transgender migrants in detention and clinicians in coping with COVID-19-related barriers to therapeutic services.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978609/;29/9/2020;Coronavirus;0.9973

The COVID-19 pandemic has a large impact in the routine of the many health services, including surgery, which demanded changes in assist protocols. Questions began to arise about well-established surgery conducts due to situations related to SARS-COV-2 infection, and, according to public health measures that are necessary to fight the pandemic. In situations of scarce available evidence, it is natural for us to have to deal with systematically more fragile, provisory and bias-susceptible information. Considering the principles that guide Evidence Based Medicine and Bioethical, the authors analyze the complexity of the medical decision-making during this time. Medical conducts must be adapted to the context of fighting the pandemic and consider patients and healthcare providers exposure and well-being and, lastly, the conservation of resources. The authors conclude that acceptance and tolerance to divergence is commendable, being a path to achieving unity in the diversity of medicine in times of little safe knowledge.;"https://doi.org/10.1590/0100-6991e-20202705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053066/";1/1/2020;how to deal with already available or lacking scientific evidence;0.9584
1517;Should we screen patients with hematologic malignancies for COVID‐19?;10.1002/hon.2780;The coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic has posed several challenges to the hematology community to re‐organize the medical care of patients with hematologic malignancies. Whereas the oncology societies favored a more or less conservative approach which considered the possibility of delaying treatment administration on a case‐by‐case basis, the hematology community guidelines were less stringent and recommended adequate individualized regimens. As countries are de‐escalating the lockdown and the medical community is unable to foresee the end of the current outbreak will and whether the pandemic would eventually come back as a seasonal infection, there is interest in screening of patients with hematology malignancies with COVID‐19 instead of limiting access to curative treatments. The rapidly accumulating knowledge about COVID‐19 allows a better understanding of the diagnostic tools that may be potentially used in screening. Herein, we briefly review the pathophysiology of COVID‐19, the rationale of screening of patients with hematologic malignancies, tools for screening, and available guidelines.

1518;A Microservices e-Health System for Ecological Frailty Assessment Using Wearables †;10.3390/s20123427;The population in developed countries is aging and this fact results in high elderly health costs, as well as a decrease in the number of active working members to support these costs. This could lead to a collapse of the current systems. One of the first insights of the decline in elderly people is frailty, which could be decelerated if it is detected at an early stage. Nowadays, health professionals measure frailty manually through questionnaires and tests of strength or gait focused on the physical dimension. Sensors are increasingly used to measure and monitor different e-health indicators while the user is performing Basic Activities of Daily Life (BADL). In this paper, we present a system based on microservices architecture, which collects sensory data while the older adults perform Instrumental ADLs (IADLs) in combination with BADLs. IADLs involve physical dimension, but also cognitive and social dimensions. With the sensory data we built a machine learning model to assess frailty status which outperforms the previous works that only used BADLs. Our model is accurate, ecological, non-intrusive, flexible and can help health professionals to automatically detect frailty.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32560529/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s20123427";17/6/2020;Basic Activities of Daily Life;0.9056

Infection triggers the respiratory tract disease COVID-19, which is accompanied by serious changes in clinical biomarkers such as hemoglobin and interleukins. The same parameters are altered during hemolysis, which is characterized by an increase in labile heme. We present two computational–experimental approaches aimed at analyzing a potential link between heme-related and COVID-19 pathophysiologies. Herein, we performed a detailed analysis of the common pathways induced by heme and SARS-CoV-2 by superimposition of knowledge graphs covering heme biology and COVID-19 pathophysiology. Focus was laid on inflammatory pathways and distinct biomarkers as the linking elements. In a second approach, four COVID-19-related proteins, the host cell proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as well as the viral proteins 7a and S protein were computationally analyzed as potential heme-binding proteins with an experimental validation. The results contribute to the understanding of the progression of COVID-19 infections in patients with different clinical backgrounds and may allow for a more individual diagnosis and therapy in the future.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11050644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925394/";27/4/2021;respiratory tract disease;0.9418
1521;Self-Isolation Compliance In The COVID-19 Era Influenced By Compensation: Findings From A Recent Survey In Israel.;10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00382;"A new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is spreading since December 2019. In an attempt to contain the disease, health authorities call for self-quarantine of individuals suspected as exposures. Health officials assume the public will comply in high rates; however, studies suggest that a major obstacle to compliance for household quarantine is concern over loss of income. A cross sectional study of the adult population of Israel was conducted in the last week of February 2020 to assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, public compliance rates with self-quarantine were assessed depending on compensation for lost wages. The results suggest that when compensation was assumed, the compliance rate was 94%; yet, when compensation was removed, the compliance rate dropped to less than 57%. This study demonstrates that providing people with assurances for their livelihood during self-quarantine is an important component in compliance with public health regulations.

1522;Titrating Teaching: An Interdisciplinary Case Study of Online and Face-to-Face Undergraduate Biochemistry Instruction;10.1128/jmbe.v22i1.2603;Although many science education researchers have investigated developing science education at the K–12 levels to meet the needs of underrepresented students in science, far fewer have considered how shifts to online instruction in undergraduate science courses might provide insights into better supporting the achievement of students from diverse backgrounds at the university level. This case study aims to fill this gap by engaging in a reflective interdisciplinary “deep dive” into the instruction of one biochemistry professor at a designated Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), across two distinct modalities: face-to-face and online. The findings reported here suggest that the use of formative assessments and student feedback surveys, as well as responsive instructional strategies, facilitate access to and comprehension of complex material in the online modality, without diminishing achievement. Additionally, the reflective collaboration deployed methodologically in this study highlights how higher education faculty can marshal intellectual resources across distinct disciplines to identify and develop responsive pedagogy in advanced science courses at the university level.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060134/;31/3/2021;Hispanic Serving Institution;0.9753

The influent concentrations of 2,4,6-TCP tested were 10 mg/L, 30 mg/L, and 50 mg/L. Sludge reduction, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate, and sludge toxicity were measured. The results showed that from 30 to 80 d, when the COD removal rate was at an acceptable level, the sludge reduction levels for the 10 mg/L, 30 mg/L, and 50 mg/L groups were 9.7%, 31.6%, and 41.5%, respectively, and the average sludge toxicity values were 24.2%, 38.0%, and 53.0%, respectively. Sludge reduction was positively correlated with sludge toxicity. The two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/results showed that extracellular and intracellular proteins secreted by the activated sludge during uncoupling metabolism were positively correlated with sludge toxicity.

Soon after its emergence in late December 2019, it was noticed that diabetic individuals were at an increased risk of COVID-19-associated complications, ICU admissions, and mortality. Maintaining proper blood glucose levels using insulin and/or other oral antidiabetic drugs (such as Metformin) reduced the detrimental effects of COVID-19. Interestingly, in diabetic COVID-19 patients, while insulin administration was associated with adverse outcomes, Metformin treatment was correlated with a significant reduction in disease severity and mortality rates among affected individuals. Metformin was extensively studied for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral capabilities that would explain its ability to confer cardiopulmonary and vascular protection in COVID-19. Here, we describe the various possible molecular mechanisms that contribute to Metformin therapy's beneficial effects and lay out the scientific basis of repurposing Metformin for use in COVID-19 patients.;"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157054/";1/6/2021;Coronavirus Disease 2019;0.9048
1525;Specificity in Ubiquitination Triggered by Virus Infection;10.3390/ijms21114088;Ubiquitination is a prominent posttranslational modification, in which the ubiquitin moiety is covalently attached to a target protein to influence protein stability, interaction partner and biological function. All seven lysine residues of ubiquitin, along with the N-terminal methionine, can each serve as a substrate for further ubiquitination, which effectuates a diverse combination of mono- or poly-ubiquitinated proteins with linear or branched ubiquitin chains. The intricately composed ubiquitin codes are then recognized by a large variety of ubiquitin binding domain (UBD)-containing proteins to participate in the regulation of various pathways to modulate the cell behavior. Viruses, as obligate parasites, involve many aspects of the cell pathways to overcome host defenses and subjugate cellular machineries. In the virus-host interactions, both the virus and the host tap into the rich source of versatile ubiquitination code in order to compete, combat, and co-evolve. Here, we review the recent literature to discuss the role of ubiquitin system as the infection progresses in virus life cycle and the importance of ubiquitin specificity in the regulation of virus-host relation.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21114088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32521668/";8/6/2020;ubiquitin binding domain;0.9655

Stethoscopes touch many patients, but current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not support disinfection between each patient. Stethoscopes are rarely disinfected between patients by healthcare providers. When cultured, even after disinfection, stethoscopes have high rates of pathogen contamination, identical to that of unwashed hands. The consequence of these practices may bode poorly in the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Alternatively, the CDC recommends the use of disposable stethoscopes. However, these instruments have poor acoustic properties, and misdiagnoses have been documented. They may also serve as pathogen vectors among staff sharing them. Disposable aseptic stethoscope diaphragm barriers can provide increased safety without sacrificing stethoscope function. We recommend that the CDC consider the research regarding stethoscope hygiene and effective solutions to contemporize this guidance and elevate stethoscope hygiene to that of the hands, by requiring stethoscope disinfection or change of disposable barrier between every patient encounter.;"https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2021.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34009112/";19/5/2021;coronavirus 2019 disease;0.9413

We sought to estimate the potential impact of COVID-19 on operating expenses and revenues of primary care practices.Using a microsimulation model incorporating national data on primary care utilization, staffing, expenditures, and reimbursements, including telemedicine visits, we estimated that primary care practices over the course of calendar year 2020 would be expected to lose $67,774 in gross revenue per full time physician (the difference between 2020 gross revenue with COVID-19 and the anticipated gross revenue if COVID-19 had not occurred, interquartile range: -$80,557, -$54,990). We further estimated that the cost would be $15.1 billion at a national level to neutralize the revenue losses caused by COVID-19 among primary care practices.

Hence, we tried to understand the effect of synergism of these drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 protease using sequential docking studies. As a result, combination of three drugs showed a better binding energy than that of individual drugs. Further, the complex was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to get insights into the stability of the complex, considering the simultaneous interactions between three drugs and the protein.

DESIGN: Cross‐sectional study. METHODS: The study covered 2,999 nursing students in six undergraduate nursing schools. Several self‐report questionnaires were used to collect the general information, psychological stress, coping styles and professional identity of the undergraduate nursing students. RESULTS: The overall average score of the professional identity of nursing students (3.67 ± 0.51) has increased significantly after the outbreak of COVID‐19. The professional identity of the undergraduate nursing students was negatively correlated with psychological stress (r = −0.23, p < .001), expectation (r = −0.12, p < .001) and avoidance (r = −0.16, p < .001), but was positively correlated with solving problems (r = 0.18, p < .001) and seeking support (r = 0.12, p < .001). Academic performance, positions, grades, reasons for choosing a nursing profession, parents or relatives engaged in nursing work and the risk degree of residence were the factors influencing the professional identity score of undergraduate nursing students' (p < .001).;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960736/; https://doi.org/10.1002/nop2.902";7/5/2021;Cross‐sectional study;0.9468

In the United States, the first case was reported on January 22. By March 1, US cases had increased to 30. After one more month, US cases multiplied drastically to more than 163 000 with almost 3000 dead. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, proved to be extraordinarily contagious and to cause higher mortality than had previous related viruses; and the death rate is significantly higher among older populations and those with preexisting conditions. Because the current health crisis is caused by the intersection of a virus, preexisting medical conditions, and the social conditions ripe for the virus's spread and development into severe disease, we recognize this pandemic also as a syndemic.1 (Am J Public Health.

1539;The Possible Double-Edged Sword Effects of Vitamin D on COVID-19: A Hypothesis.;10.1002/cbin.11469;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) gains access to host cells by attaching to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Vitamin D (VitD) can up-regulate ACE2 and has an antagonistic effect on Renin, which exert vasodilatation and anti-inflammatory effect against coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, it may also facilitate viral entry by increasing ACE2 as main SARS-CoV-2receptor and mediates ROS production through NADPH oxidase, as a double-edged sword effect. Lung function and the immune system are also influenced by VitD through several mechanisms, including increased natural antibiotics (Defensin and Cathelicidin) and up-regulated TGFβ. Higher IgA, Th2/Th1 ratio, and T-regulatory cells are attributable to VitD effects on the immune cells, while these changes may also be a double-edged sword in COVID-19. Although VitD supplementation might be highly recommended in COVID-19, the administration's dosage and route could be challenging. Further, this issue has not been mentioned in the various studies so far. So, the report aimed to explain the current challenges with application of VitD in COVID-19. This article is protected by  .

To assess and critically evaluate how EMA methods are currently being used in HIV research, we systematically reviewed recent published literature (October 2017-October 2019) and searched select conference databases for 2018 and 2019. RECENT FINDINGS Our searches identified 8 published articles that used EMA via smartphone app, a handheld Personal Digital Assistant, and web-based survey programs for real-time measurement of HIV-related exposures and outcomes in behavioral research. Overall trends include use of EMA and technology devices to address substance use, HIV primary prevention (e.g., condom use and preexposure prophylaxis), and HIV treatment (medication adherence). This review supports the use of EMA methods in HIV research and recommends that researchers use EMA methods to measure psychosocial factors and social contexts and with Black and Latinx samples of gay and bisexual men, transgender women, and cisgendered women to reflect current HIV disparities in the U.S.A.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11904-020-00507-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32594365/";27/6/2020;PURPOSE OF REVIEW;0.9214

1543;Pharmacological hypothesis: TPC2 antagonist tetrandrine as a potential therapeutic agent for COVID‐19;10.1002/prp2.653;More than ten million patients worldwide have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19) to date (WHO situation report, 1st July 2020). There is no vaccine to prevent infection with the causative organism, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), nor a cure. In the struggle to devise potentially useful therapeutics in record time, the repurposing of existing compounds is a key route of action. In this hypothesis paper, we argue that the bisbenzylisoquinoline and calcium channel blocker tetrandrine, originally extracted from the plant Stephania tetrandra and utilized in traditional Chinese medicine, may have potential in the treatment of COVID‐19 and should be further investigated. We collate and review evidence for tetrandrine's putative mechanism of action in viral infection, specifically its recently discovered antagonism of the two‐pore channel 2 (TPC2). While tetrandrine's particular history of use provides a very limited pharmacological dataset, there is a suggestion from the available evidence that it could be effective at doses used in clinical practice. We suggest that further research to investigate this possibility should be conducted.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/prp2.653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930523/";15/9/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9744

This study sought to understand the impact of COVID-19 on staff, patients and families. METHODS: The Department of Neuropsychology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery established three new support services for staff, patients and families. Semi-structured interviews elicited concerns and if these were affected by COVID-19. Staff members were asked to complete the General Health Questionnaire-12. RESULTS: Few staff members presented for support, but nearly all indicated significant distress, reflecting increased anxiety and reduced social support. Patients described exacerbated emotional, cognitive and physical concerns, and greater vulnerability to isolation and economic hardship. Families and carers reported increased distress arising from hospital lockdown. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 disruption affects staff, patients and families.

The signature includes discrete changes in B and myelomonocytic cell composition, profoundly altered T cell phenotypes, selective cytokine/chemokine upregulation and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Some signature traits identify links with other settings of immunoprotection and immunopathology; others, including basophil and plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion, correlate strongly with disease severity; while a third set of traits, including a triad of IP-10, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6, anticipate subsequent clinical progression.

To assess the validity of the hypothesis, I propose a periodization of the economic, political, and social changes that occurred in Latin America in the past decades. RECENT FINDINGS A brief review of recent studies on social determinants of mental health (with a focus on Brazil), considering research findings by historical context, shows that urbanization-modernization-migration variables were more present in the literature in the decades of 1980 and 1990, whereas social inequity factors (gender, ethnicity/race, and racism) came to be dominant as a research question after the year 2000.

1547;Introducing a Navigation Algorithm for Reducing the Spread of Diseases in Public Transport Networks.;10.3233/shti210097;Reducing passenger flow through highly frequented bottlenecks in public transportation networks is a well-known urban planning problem. This issue has become even more relevant since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the necessity for minimum distances between passengers. We propose an approach that allows to dynamically navigate passengers around dangerously crowded stations to better distribute the passenger load across an entire urban public transport network. This is achieved through the introduction of new constraints into routing requests, that enable the avoidance of specific nodes in a network. These requests consider walks, bikes, metros, subways, trams and buses as possible modes of transportation. An implementation of the approach is provided in cooperation with the Munich Travel Corporation (MVG) for the city of Munich, to simulate the effects on a real city's urban traffic flow. Among other factors, the impact on the travel time was simulated given that the two major exchange points in the network were to be avoided. With an increase from 26.5 to 26.8 minutes on the average travel time, the simulation suggests that the time penalty might be worth the safety benefits.;"https://doi.org/10.3233/shti210097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965927/";7/5/2021;Munich Travel Corporation;0.9584

Occasionally patient may present with gastro-intestinal, cardiac and neurologic symptoms with or without lung involvement. Pathologically, the lungs show either mild congestion and alveolar exudation or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with hyaline membrane or histopathology of acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia (AFOP) that parallels disease severity. Other organs like liver and kidneys may be involved secondarily. Currently the treatment is principally symptomatic and prevention by proper use of personal protective equipment and other measures is crucial to limit the spread.

Will the PPF get improved or stay stable, or progress? Such questions could only be answered by follow-up and monitoring of the pulmonary function. At the same time, we should learn from the lessons on pulmonary function loss of the SARS patients and MERS patients, some of whom had persistent impaired lung function after discharge. Pirfenidone and Nintedanib had been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(IPF), showing effectiveness on non-IPF pulmonary fibrosis as well. However, there are no studies about the application on PPF resulting from viral pneumonia.

The interaction of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) with its main host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has emerged as a critical focal point for the development of anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. In this study, we selectively identify and characterize the impact of mutating certain amino acid residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and in ACE2, by utilizing our recently developed NanoBiT technology-based biosensor as well as pseudotyped-virus infectivity assays. Specifically, we examine the mutational effects on RBD-ACE2 binding ability, efficacy of competitive inhibitors, as well as neutralizing antibody activity. We also look at the implications the mutations may have on virus transmissibility, host susceptibility, and the virus transmission path to humans. These critical determinants of virus–host interactions may provide more effective targets for ongoing vaccines, drug development, and potentially pave the way for determining the genetic variation underlying disease severity.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22052268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33668756/";25/2/2021;viral receptor binding domain;0.9492

The Impact of Built Environment on Healthcare Staff Wellbeing;10.1007/978-3-030-58814-4_24;Projects, plans and programmes for complex environments such as healthcare facilities need to be designed with specific consideration of the multitude of users, technologies and policies in order to address a sustainable and resilient development. Several Evidence Based Design (EBD) studies highlight the deep interrelation between built and natural systems with human or organizations-related outcomes, but the effect on healthcare staff such as Medical Doctors (MD) is still underexplored. The paper investigates the assessment of self-reported satisfaction and wellbeing of MDs in healthcare facilities. A multidimensional assessment model composed of 53 Likert scale questions has been developed from literature review and existing tools, and submitted to a statistically significant sample of workers in 2 different office settings of an Italian hospital. Since MDs spend a considerable amount of their working time in offices, the qualities of such space are very important. The study highlights and confirms that localization, indoor environment, natural and artificial light are relevant drivers for staff satisfaction and wellbeing.

Using province-level geolocation data from Italy, we document that political disbelief can limit government policy effectiveness. Residents in provinces leaning towards extreme right-wing parties show lower rates of compliance with social distancing order. We also find that, during the Italian lockdown, provinces with high protest votes virtually disregarded all social distancing orders. On the contrary, in provinces with higher political support for the current political legislation, we found a higher degree of social distancing compliance. These results are robust to controlling for other factors, including time, geography, local COVID-19 cases and deaths, healthcare hospital beds, and other sociodemographic and economic characteristics. Our research shows that bipartisan support and national responsibility are essential to implement and manage social distancing efficiently. From a broader perspective, our findings suggest that partisan politics and discontent with the political class (i.e., protest voting) might significantly affect human health and the economy.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980748/;20/3/2021;coronavirus;0.9229
1554;Using self‐organising maps to predict and contain natural disasters and pandemics;10.1002/int.22440;The unfolding coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic has highlighted the global need for robust predictive and containment tools and strategies. COVID‐19 continues to cause widespread economic and social turmoil, and while the current focus is on both minimising the spread of the disease and deploying a range of vaccines to save lives, attention will soon turn to future proofing. In line with this, this paper proposes a prediction and containment model that could be used for pandemics and natural disasters. It combines selective lockdowns and protective cordons to rapidly contain the hazard while allowing minimally impacted local communities to conduct “business as usual” and/or offer support to highly impacted areas. A flexible, easy to use data analytics model, based on Self Organising Maps, is developed to facilitate easy decision making by governments and organisations. Comparative tests using publicly available data for Great Britain (GB) show that through the use of the proposed prediction and containment strategy, it is possible to reduce the peak infection rate, while keeping several regions (up to 25% of GB parliamentary constituencies) economically active within protective cordons.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242463/;2/5/2021;coronavirus;0.9946

These measures to reduce human contact, such as social distancing, are deemed necessary to contain the spread of the virus and protect those at increased risk of developing complications following infection with COVID-19. People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are advised to adhere to even more stringent restrictions compared to the general population, and avoid any social contact with people outside their household. This social isolation combined with the anxiety and stress associated with the pandemic, is likely to particularly have an impact on mental health and psychological wellbeing in people with RA. Increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour can improve mental health and psychological wellbeing in RA. However, COVID-19 restrictions make it more difficult for people with RA to be physically active and facilitate a more sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, guidance is necessary for people with RA to adopt a healthy lifestyle within the constraints of COVID-19 restrictions to support their mental health and psychological wellbeing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196006/; https://doi.org/10.31138/mjr.31.3.284";21/9/2020;community containment;0.929

Semi-structured interviews with COPD patients (n = 9) and three semi-structured focus groups with HCPs (n = 25) were conducted in São Paulo. Interviews were thematically analysed using The Framework Method. Despite a high prevalence of edentulism, patients viewed tooth loss and decay as a norm and neglected preventative oral health practices. HCPs blamed patients for avoiding preventative opportunities, whilst patients discussed significant barriers to oral healthcare. Knowledge of the relationship between oral health and COPD was lacking among HCPs and patients, but all participants were receptive to oral health education. Practitioners identified the need for a COPD primary care pathway that integrates oral health protocols.

1559;Therapeutic targeting of interleukin-6 for the treatment of COVID-19.;10.1684/ecn.2020.0453;Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in China and has spread worldwide with a significant rate of infection. Considering the elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19, it is suggested that cytokine storms play a critical role in its pathogenesis, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there is no specific drug for preventing the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) caused by COVID-19. Indeed, interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been highlighted for its many biological functions, such as immune regulation, inflammatory response, and metabolism. Therapeutic blockade of the IL-6 signaling pathway is expected to reduce the excessive immune reponse observed in COVID-19. Currently, the IL-6 receptor antagonists tocilizumab and sarilumab, have been adopted for preventing CRS during the progression of COVID-19, and remarkable beneficial effects were observed by using these humanized monoclonal antibodies. Based on the pathogenesis of COVID-19, we reviewed the biological mechanism of IL-6 blockade in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluated its clinical applications.;"https://doi.org/10.1684/ecn.2020.0453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270024/";3/12/2020;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9314
1560;T‐cell immunobiology and cytokine storm of COVID‐19;10.1111/sji.12989;2019 coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) presents as a newly recognized pneumonia and could rapidly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome which has brought about a global pandemic. Until now, no curative therapy has been strongly recommended for COVID‐19 except for personalized supportive care. T cells and virus‐specific T cells are essential to protect against virus infection, including COVID‐19. Delayed immune reconstitution (IR) and cytokine storm (CS) remain serious obstacles for the cure of COVID‐19. Most COVID‐19 patients, especially among elderly patients, had marked lymphopenia and increased neutrophils, but T cell counts in severe COVID‐19 patients surviving the disease gradually restored later. Elevated pro‐inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL‐6, IL‐10, IL‐2, and IL‐17, and exhausted T cells are found in peripheral blood and the lungs. It suggests that Thymosin α1 and adoptive COVID‐19‐specific T cells could improve IR while convalescent plasma, IL‐6 blockade, mesenchymal stem cells, and corticosteroids could suppress CS. More clinical studies in this field worldwide are urgently warranted to pave the way for therapy of COVID‐19 in the future.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/sji.12989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33113222/";28/10/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9563

Individuals from the country at risk of COVID-19 infection have been included in a home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain. MethodsTo estimate the possible number of infected individuals within the large influx of international students, we used a deterministic compartmental model for epidemic and perform a simulation-based search of different rates of compliance with home-quarantine. ResultsUnder the home-quarantine program, the total number of the infected individuals would reach 24-53 from March 17-March 20, 50-86 from March 18- March 16, and 234- 343 from March 4- March 23 with the arrival of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 1% of pre-infectious individuals, in Seoul, South Korea, respectively. Our findings indicated when incoming international students showed strict compliance with quarantine, epidemics were less likely to occur in Seoul, South Korea. ConclusionTo mitigate possible epidemics, additional efforts to improve the compliance of home-quarantine are warranted along with other containment policies.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023234;19/2/2020;coronavirus;0.9765

1563;Immune responses during COVID-19 infection;10.1080/2162402x.2020.1807836;Over the past 16 years, three coronaviruses (CoVs), severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012 and 2015, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, have been causing severe and fatal human epidemics. The unpredictability of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) poses a major burden on health care and economic systems across the world. This is caused by the paucity of in-depth knowledge of the risk factors for severe COVID-19, insufficient diagnostic tools for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the absence of specific and effective drug treatments. While protective humoral and cellular immune responses are usually mounted against these betacoronaviruses, immune responses to SARS-CoV2 sometimes derail towards inflammatory tissue damage, leading to rapid admissions to intensive care units. The lack of knowledge on mechanisms that tilt the balance between these two opposite outcomes poses major threats to many ongoing clinical trials dealing with immunostimulatory or immunoregulatory therapeutics. This review will discuss innate and cognate immune responses underlying protective or deleterious immune reactions against these pathogenic coronaviruses.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939324/; https://doi.org/10.1080/2162402x.2020.1807836";25/8/2020;coronavirus disease-19;0.9794

Dental practices are focal points for cross‐infection, and care must be taken to minimise the risk of infection to, from, or between dental care professionals and patients. The COVID‐19 epidemiological and clinical characteristics are still being collated but children's symptoms seem to be milder than those that adults experience. It is unknown whether certain groups, for example children with comorbidities, might be at a higher risk of more severe illness. Emerging data on disease spread in children, affected by COVID‐19, have not been presented in detail. The purpose of this article was to report current data on the paediatric population affected with COVID‐19 and highlight considerations for dentists providing care for children during this pandemic. All members of the dental team have a professional responsibility to keep themselves informed of current guidance and be vigilant in updating themselves as recommendations are changing so quickly.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32250505/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ipd.12653";16/4/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9581

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with breast cancer were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of patients who were operated in the year before the COVID-19 pandemic, and Group 2 consisted of patients who were operated within the first year of the pandemic. Tumor size, axillary lymph node positivity, distant organ metastasis status, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and type of surgery performed were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The tumor size, axillary lymph node positivity, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p = .005, p = .012, p = .042, respectively). In addition, the number of breast-conserving surgery + sentinel lymph node biopsy were lower, while the number of mastectomy and modified radical mastectomy were higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p = .034).

1566;Sterilization of Microorganisms Contaminated Surfaces and its Treatment with Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma;10.1007/s41403-020-00124-8;Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is a promising method of producing non-thermal plasma, which is widely used in variety of industrial and biological applications including disinfection/sterilization. Plasma sterilization offers a faster, less toxic and versatile alternative to conventional sterilization techniques. 45 kV, 50 kHz high voltage high-frequency power supply was designed for generating DBD plasma. Experimental studies were conducted using DBD plasma on growth control in algae, breakdown of complex phenols for chemical wastewater treatment and generation of UV, ozone and other reactive species using DBD plasma discharges in ambient air. A portable DBD plasma-based sterilization system is developed for fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Quartz tube is used as a dielectric medium between copper foil—SS electrodes and 17 kV, 30 kHz pulse is applied across it, which produces intense DBD across SS mesh. This system can sterilize and disinfect the microorganism contaminated surfaces, garments and used disposable protective gears with UV, ozone and short-lived molecules of metastable states and excited chemical species of nitrogen and oxygen produced during the DBD plasma discharges in ambient air.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7298925/;16/6/2020;Dielectric barrier discharge;0.9407

In this study, PA obtained using slow pyrolysis method and fractionated using column chromatography was characterized (chemical and antioxidative properties) and investigated for its cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibition activities using the in vitro and in silico approaches. The F9 PA fraction exhibited highest total phenolic content of 181.75 ± 17.0 μg/mL. Fraction F21-25 showed ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (331.80 ± 4.60 mg TE/g) and IC50 of 18.56 ± 0.01 μg/mL towards COX-2 and 5.25 ± 0.03 μg/mL towards the 5-LOX enzymes, respectively. Molecular docking analysis suggested favourable binding energy for all chemical compounds present in fraction F21-25, notably 1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-2-pentanone, towards both COX-2 (- 6.9 kcal/mol) and 5-LOX (- 6.4 kcal/mol) enzymes. As a conclusion, PA from PKS has the potential to be used as an alternative antioxidant and antiinflammatory agents which is biodegradable and a more sustainable supply of raw materials.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09209-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418105/";16/5/2020;cyclooxygenase-2;0.9296
1568;Nox2 signaling and muscle fiber remodeling are attenuated by losartan administration during skeletal muscle unloading.;10.14814/phy2.14606;Reduced mechanical loading results in atrophy of skeletal muscle fibers. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) are causal in sarcolemmal dislocation of nNOS and FoxO3a activation. The Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase and mitochondria release ROS during disuse in skeletal muscle. Activation of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) can elicit Nox2 complex formation. The AT1R blocker losartan was used to test the hypothesis that AT1R activation drives Nox2 assembly, nNOS dislocation, FoxO3a activation, and thus alterations in morphology in the unloaded rat soleus. Male Fischer 344 rats were divided into four groups: ambulatory control (CON), ambulatory + losartan (40 mg kg-1 day-1 ) (CONL), 7 days of tail-traction hindlimb unloading (HU), and HU + losartan (HUL). Losartan attenuated unloading-induced loss of muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) and fiber-type shift. Losartan mitigated unloading-induced elevation of ROS levels and upregulation of Nox2. Furthermore, AT1R blockade abrogated nNOS dislocation away from the sarcolemma and elevation of nuclear FoxO3a. We conclude that AT1R blockade attenuates disuse remodeling by inhibiting Nox2, thereby lessening nNOS dislocation and activation of FoxO3a.;"https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.14606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400850/";1/1/2021;ambulatory control;0.9877

For an optimal management of COVID-19 (Coronary Virus Disease) we depend on a fast and reliable diagnosis and severity assessment. The gold standard so far is RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polmerase chain reaction) from the nasopharyngeal smear. Current tests have a sensitivity of 60-90 %. As a consequence, we must expect 10-40 % false negative results. In addition to oxygen saturation for severity classification, stethoscope, chest X-ray and lung computer tomography are routinely used. However, the standard methods stethoscope and chest X-ray are unreliable. Moreover, all three diagnostic examination techniques expose physicians, support staff and subsequent patients to an additional risk of exposure. In view of the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus), lung point-of-care ultrasound (Lu-PoCUS) is a still underutilized valuable alternative, especially when using pocket devices. In this review the current value and role of stethoscope, pulsoxymetry, chest x ray, lung computer tomography and lung point-of-care ultrasound will be determined based on the available literature.;"https://doi.org/10.1024/1661-8157/a003512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356672/";1/5/2020;Coronary Virus Disease;0.9542

Amongst the emerging neurologic complications is sensorineural hearing loss. While several cases of hearing loss amongst COVID-19 patients have been reported, the management of these patients has yet to be discussed and determined. Herein we present cochlear implant outcomes for a patient who suffered from unilateral sensorineural hearing loss after a prolonged hospital course for COVID-19. METHODS A patient who was hospitalized for COVID-19 for one month and subsequently developed unilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss underwent cochlear implantation for single-sided deafness. His COVID-19 hospital course was reviewed in detail. Speech perception and audiometric assessments were used to evaluate cochlear implant outcomes. RESULTS After cochlear implantation, the patient demonstrated improved speech perception on the implanted side and decreased tinnitus within 1 month of activation. CONCLUSIONS Cochlear implantation may be an appropriate intervention for patients who suffer from severe sensorineural hearing loss following infection with COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/14670100.2021.1936364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151741/";19/6/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9428
1571;SARS-CoV-2 causes severe alveolar inflammation and barrier dysfunction;10.1101/2020.08.31.276725;Infections with SARS-CoV-2 lead to mild to severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with systemic symptoms. Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses. To elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human alveolus-on-a-chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including the interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was no infected and did neither show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types are damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear. In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier function and viral dissemination.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.276725;1/9/2020;coronavirus disease-19;0.927
1572;The broad spectrum host-directed agent ivermectin as an antiviral for SARS-CoV-2?;10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.10.042;FDA approved for parasitic indications, the small molecule ivermectin has been the focus of growing attention in the last 8 years due to its potential as an antiviral. We first identified ivermectin in a high throughput compound library screen as an agent potently able to inhibit recognition of the nuclear localizing Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) integrase protein by the host importin (IMP) α/β1 heterodimer, and recently demonstrated its ability to bind directly to IMPα to cause conformational changes that prevent its function in nuclear import of key viral as well as host proteins. Cell culture experiments have shown robust antiviral action towards a whole range of viruses, including HIV-1, dengue, Zika and West Nile Virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Chikungunya, pseudorabies virus, adenovirus, and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Close to 70 clinical trials are currently in progress worldwide for SARS-CoV-2. Although few of these studies have been completed, the results that are available, as well as those from observational/retrospective studies, indicate clinical benefit. Here we discuss the case for ivermectin as a host-directed broad-spectrum antiviral agent, including for SARS-CoV-2.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X20319598?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33341233/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.10.042; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X20319598";21/10/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9924

These experiences provide students a unique opportunity to apply skills learned in pre-clinical training through hands-on practice. However, the emergence of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and the subsequent global pandemic of 2020 forced many clinical instructors to adapt to teaching online. This teaching tip describes the use of backward design to create a three-part online clinical learning environment for the delivery of small animal primary care consisting of synchronous rounds, simulated online appointments, and independent learning activities. Results of a survey of students' perspectives on the experience demonstrate that the majority of students found that the online clinical experience met or exceeded expectations and provided a meaningful learning experience. Recommendations based on student feedback and instructor reflection are provided to guide creation and implementation of future online clinical courses. As the field of telemedicine grows, we view incorporation of such learning environments into veterinary medical education curriculum as essential to preparing students to enter the modern veterinary workplace.;"https://doi.org/10.3138/jvme-2020-0130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929298/";21/4/2021;Clinical clerkships;0.9523

Here, we perform a large-scale, spatiotemporal analysis of human mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic. We derive human mobility from anonymized, aggregated telecommunication data in a nationwide setting (Switzerland; 10 February to 26 April 2020), consisting of ∼1.5 billion trips. In comparison to the same time period from 2019, human movement in Switzerland dropped by 49.1%. The strongest reduction is linked to bans on gatherings of more than five people, which are estimated to have decreased mobility by 24.9%, followed by venue closures (stores, restaurants, and bars) and school closures. As such, human mobility at a given day predicts reported cases 7 to 13 d ahead. A 1% reduction in human mobility predicts a 0.88 to 1.11% reduction in daily reported COVID-19 cases. When managing epidemics, monitoring human mobility via telecommunication data can support public decision makers in two ways. First, it helps in assessing policy impact; second, it provides a scalable tool for near real-time epidemic surveillance, thereby enabling evidence-based policies.";"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100664118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162708/";29/6/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9764
1575;Nebenwirkungen neuer onkologischer Immuntherapien;10.1007/s11560-020-00424-8;Systemic treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has revolutionized the treatment of hematological and oncological diseases in recent years. The mechanism of action hinges on enhancing the natural ability of the immune system to eliminate malignant cells. The most important substances in this arena include inhibitors of PD‑1, PD-L1 and CTLA‑4. As a consequence, the spectrum of treatment-associated adverse reactions is shifting away from classical cytotoxic effects (e.g. pancytopenia and polyneuropathy) towards novel entities of immune-mediated complex diseases. These so-called immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can involve any organ system and mimic known classical autoimmune conditions. Timely recognition of irAEs is the key for rapid initiation of a suitable treatment and is especially challenging in the clinical routine as it requires an intensive interdisciplinary management. Nephrologists are particularly confronted with this kind of problem due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of their work. This article summarizes the broad spectrum of currently known renal and more frequently occuring non-renal forms of irAEs and aims to prime the reader on diagnostic and therapeutic options.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189634/;29/4/2020;immune checkpoint inhibitors;0.9033

This study analyzes the effects of COVID-19 based on likely positive cases and fatality in India during and after the lockdown period from March 24, 2020, to May 24, 2020. METHODS: Python has been used as the main programming language for data analysis and forecasting using the Prophet model, a time series analysis model. The data set has been preprocessed by grouping together the days for total numbers of cases and deaths on few selected dates and removing missing values present in some states. RESULTS: The Prophet model performs better in terms of precision on the real data. Prediction depicts that, during the lockdown, the total cases were rising but in a controlled manner with an accuracy of 87%. After the relaxation of lockdown rules, the predictions have shown an obstreperous situation with an accuracy of 60%. CONCLUSION: The resilience could have been better if the lockdown with strict norms was continued without much relaxation. The situation after lockdown has been found to be uncertain as observed by the experimental study conducted in this work.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33203489/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.444";18/11/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9381

1578;COVID-19 and coagulative axis: review of emerging aspects in a novel disease.;10.4081/monaldi.2020.1300;Latest evidences from literature suggest that SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) is commonly complicated with coagulopathy and that disseminated intravascular coagulation is present in the majority of deceased patients. Particularly, conventional coagulation parameters appear to be significantly altered in patients with poor prognosis. A wide-ranging cross- talk between coagulative haemostasis and inflammation, as well as the activation of coagulation cascade during viral infections, are well established. Another important evidence which may explain coagulation disorders in COVID-19 is the increase of thrombus formation under conditions of hypoxia. Despite the exact pathophysiological mechanism of coronavirus-induced thromboembolism needs to be further investigated, this finding suggests that it is good practice to assess the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients to improvethe clinical management in terms of anticoagulation therapy. Anticoagulants, mainly low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), should be tailored in patients meeting sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer. In this context, further studies are needed to optimise the decision making in therapeutic approach.;"https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425013/";19/5/2020;SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019;0.9251

There has been research showing that on average, each infected person spreads the infection to more than two persons. Therefore the majority of the population is at risk of infection if no intervention measures were undertaken. The true size of the COVID-19 epidemic remains unknown, as a significant proportion of infected individuals only exhibit mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. A timely assessment of the evolving epidemic size is crucial for resource allocation and triage decisions. In this article, we modify the back-calculation algorithm to obtain a lower bound estimate of the number of COVID-19 infected persons in China outside the Hubei province.

1580;Web Conferencing Facilitation Within Problem-Based Learning Biomedical Engineering Courses;10.1007/s43683-020-00020-1;Problem-based learning (PBL) has been effectively used within BME education, though there are several challenges in its implementation within courses with larger enrollments. Furthermore, the sudden transition to online learning from the COVID-19 pandemic introduced additional challenges in creating a similar PBL experience in an online environment. Online constrained PBL was implemented through asynchronous modules and synchronous web conferencing with rotating facilitators. Overall, facilitators perceived web conferencing facilitation to be similar to in-person, but noted that students were more easily “hidden” or distracted. Students did not comment on web conferencing facilitation specifically, but indicated the transition to online PBL was smooth. Course instructors identified that a fully synchronous delivery as well as modifications of Group Meeting Minutes assignments as potential modifications for future offerings. Future work will aim to address the perceptions and effectiveness of web conferencing facilitation for PBL courses within an undergraduate BME curriculum, as web conferencing could prove to be another significant breakthrough in addressing challenges of problem-based learning courses.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7466918/;2/9/2020;Problem-based learning;0.9036

The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Since then, social media platforms have experienced an exponential rise in the content related to the pandemic. In the past, Twitter data have been observed to be indispensable in the extraction of situational awareness information relating to any crisis. This paper presents COV19Tweets Dataset (Lamsal 2020a), a large-scale Twitter dataset with more than 310 million COVID-19 specific English language tweets and their sentiment scores. The dataset’s geo version, the GeoCOV19Tweets Dataset (Lamsal 2020b), is also presented. The paper discusses the datasets’ design in detail, and the tweets in both the datasets are analyzed. The datasets are released publicly, anticipating that they would contribute to a better understanding of spatial and temporal dimensions of the public discourse related to the ongoing pandemic. As per the stats, the datasets (Lamsal 2020a, 2020b) have been accessed over 74.5k times, collectively.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7646503/;6/11/2020;Novel Coronavirus;0.9824
1582;Over- and undersensing—pitfalls of arrhythmia detection with implantable devices and wearables;10.1007/s00399-020-00710-x;Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) are a cornerstone of arrhythmia and heart failure detection as well as management. In recent years new kinds of devices have emerged which can be used subcutaneously or worn on the skin. In particular for large-scale arrhythmia monitoring, small, unobtrusive gadgets seem positioned to upend paradigms and care delivery. However, the performance of CIEDs and wearables is only as good as their sensing and detection capacities. Whether for pacing, defibrillation or diagnostic monitoring, the device must be able to process and filter the sensed signal to reduce noise and to exclude irrelevant physiological signals. The demands on sensing and detection quality will differ depending on how the information is applied. With a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter/defibrillator, withheld or erroneous therapy can have severe consequences and accurate and reliable detection of cardiac function is crucial. Monitoring devices are usually used in risk assessment and management, with greater tolerance for isolated artefacts or lower quality of readings. This review discusses sensing and detection and the performance to date by CIEDs as well as subcutaneous and wearable devices.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767089/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00399-020-00710-x";7/8/2020;Cardiac implantable electronic devices;0.9049
1583;The Serpin Superfamily and Their Role in the Regulation and Dysfunction of Serine Protease Activity in COPD and Other Chronic Lung Diseases;10.3390/ijms22126351;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating heterogeneous disease characterised by unregulated proteolytic destruction of lung tissue mediated via a protease-antiprotease imbalance. In COPD, the relationship between the neutrophil serine protease, neutrophil elastase, and its endogenous inhibitor, alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) is the best characterised. AAT belongs to a superfamily of serine protease inhibitors known as serpins. Advances in screening technologies have, however, resulted in many members of the serpin superfamily being identified as having differential expression across a multitude of chronic lung diseases compared to healthy individuals. Serpins exhibit a unique suicide-substrate mechanism of inhibition during which they undergo a dramatic conformational change to a more stable form. A limitation is that this also renders them susceptible to disease-causing mutations. Identification of the extent of their physiological/pathological role in the airways would allow further expansion of knowledge regarding the complexity of protease regulation in the lung and may provide wider opportunity for their use as therapeutics to aid the management of COPD and other chronic airways diseases.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8231800/;14/6/2021;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9552

1585;Tracing Back the Temporal Change of SARS-CoV-2 with Genomic Signatures;10.1101/2020.04.24.057380;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak starting from China at the end of 2019 and its subsequent spread in many countries have given rise to thousands of coronavirus samples being collected and sequenced till date. To trace back the initial temporal change of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus implicated in COVID-19, we study the limited genomic sequences that were available within the first couple of months of its spread. These samples were collected under varying circumstances and highlight wide variations in their genomic compositions. In this paper, we explore whether these variations characterize the initial temporal change of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We observe that n-mer distributions in the SARS-CoV-2 samples, which were collected at an earlier period of time, predict its collection timeline with approximately 78% accuracy. However, such a distinctive pattern disappears with the inclusion of samples collected at a later time. We further observe that isolation sources (e.g., oronasopharynx, saliva, feces, etc.) could not be predicted by the n-mer patterns in these sequences. Finally, the phylogenetic and protein-alignment analyses highlight interesting associations between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.057380;7/5/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9162
1586;COVID-19-related coagulopathy – Is transferrin a missing link?;10.1101/2020.06.11.147025;SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 disease has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, but the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related coagulopathy remain unknown. Since the risk of severe COVID-19 disease is higher in males than in females and increases with age, we combined proteomics data from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with human gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to identify gene products involved in coagulation that change with age, differ in their levels between females and males, and are regulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This resulted in the identification of transferrin as a candidate coagulation promoter, whose levels increases with age and are higher in males than in females and that is increased upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. A systematic investigation of gene products associated with the GO term “blood coagulation” did not reveal further high confidence candidates, which are likely to contribute to COVID-19-related coagulopathy. In conclusion, the role of transferrin should be considered in the course of COVID-19 disease and further examined in ongoing clinic-pathological investigations.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.11.147025;16/6/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9665
1587;Insight into the emerging role of SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural and accessory proteins in modulation of multiple mechanisms of host innate defense.;10.17305/bjbms.2020.5543;Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is an extremely infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has become a major global health concern. The induction of a coordinated immune response is crucial to the elimination of any pathogenic infection. However, SARS-CoV-2 can modulate the host immune system to favor viral adaptation and persistence within the host. The virus can counteract type I interferon (IFN-I) production, attenuating IFN-I signaling pathway activation and disrupting antigen presentation. Simultaneously, SARS-CoV-2 infection can enhance apoptosis and the production of inflammatory mediators, which ultimately results in increased disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 produces an array of effector molecules, including nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and open-reading frames (ORFs) accessory proteins. We describe the complex molecular interplay of SARS-CoV-2 NSPs and accessory proteins with the host's signaling mediating immune evasion in the current review. In addition, the crucial role played by immunomodulation therapy to address immune evasion is discussed. Thus, the current review can provide new directions for the development of vaccines and specific therapies.;"https://doi.org/10.17305/bjbms.2020.5543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33714258/";7/3/2021;Coronavirus disease-19;0.9914

Cyclic peptide (cRGD) and indocyanine green (ICG) were applied to the surface of RBCs to increase the targeting and photothermal effect, respectively. Doxorubicin (DOX) as a model drug was loaded into RBCs by the hypotonic dialysis method. A series of tests have been carried out to evaluate the RBCs-based DDS and these tasks include physicochemical properties, cellular uptake, targeting ability, and combination therapeutic efficiency. As a result, the DOX was successfully loaded into RBCs and the drug loading amount was 0.84 ± 0.09 mg/mL. There was no significant change of particle size after surface modification of RBCs. The RBCs-based DDS could target to the surface of cancer cells, which delivery DOX to the lesions efficiently and accurately. Meanwhile, due to the combined treatment effect, the RBCs-based DDS can effectively inhibit tumor growth. The RBCs-based DDS constructed in this research may have promising applications in cancer therapy due to their highly synergistic efficient therapy and to investigate its possibility for tumor therapy.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.111789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932889/";26/4/2021;Cyclic peptide;0.9566

With an initial suspicion of the animal to the human transmission for earlier cases, now the paradigm has shifted towards human to human transmission via droplets, contacts and/or through fomites. with each passing day, more and more confirmed cases are being reported worldwide which has alarmed the global authorities including World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to take immediate action in order to reduce the transmission and subsequent mortalities associated with COVID-19 to as minimum as possible. Unfortunately, like the previous Coronavirus outbreaks, there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of confirmed cases and hence preventing ourselves from contracting 2019-nCoV is the best way to prevent it from becoming pandemic.

This document is a brief commentary of the imaging modalities used in the screening, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 pneumonia. Chest x-rays, especially portable, still form a part of majority of official guidelines, with reports of the suggestive radiologic features. The potential of CT scan and ultrasound is also realised, with earlier detection rate. Typical radiologic findings of bilateral, asymmetrical, crazy-paved ground glass opacification, consolidation, reverse halo sign, opacities, progressing to fibrosis are well described for both the X-ray and CT scan. Atypical findings include airway changes, pleural effusion, pulmonary nodules and acute pulmonary embolism. Absence of lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion and pneumothorax is notable. The role of portable lung ultrasound, reported to be useful in emergency, is yet to be established in the guidelines. Disinfection of the equipment is a major concern.

1592;High-resolution CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia in confirmed cases;10.1186/s43055-020-00236-9;BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It was highly contagious spreading all over the world, with a rapid increase in the number of deaths. COVID-19 is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea with variable chest imaging features which have been detected. In our study, we shared our experience of CT findings in proven cases of COVID-19 to recognize the different CT patterns to help in proper and accurate diagnosis. RESULTS: The most common CT features detected in COVID-19 cases were ground glass patches (93.3%) followed by subpleural linear abnormality (53.3%), air bronchogram (23.3%), and consolidation patches (23.3%), as well as bronchial wall thickening (16.7%), crazy paving pattern (13.3%), and discrete nodules surrounded by ground glass appearance (10%). Only one case had pleural effusion (3.3%). No cavitary lesions or specific lymph nodes were detected in any of the examined patients. The lung lesions showed typical diffuse, basal, and subpleural involvement with less affection of the upper lobes. CONCLUSION: CT imaging findings of COVID-19 can help in early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 and proper assessment of the severity of the disease.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7339792/;7/7/2020;Coronavirus;0.9834

We concluded that the epidemic is containable with traditional nonpharmacological interventions, mainly through social distancing and finding and isolating suspected patients and close contacts. Nonpharmacological interventions are the only effective measures currently accessible and have suppressed some 90% of the infections in China. Close contacts are the major mechanism of transmission, which makes it possible to control this epidemic through nonpharmacological methods. Nucleic-acid testing alone may miss some 50% of infected patients, and other methods such as chest computerized tomography (CT) or serology should be considered to supplement molecular testing. The development of vaccines and drugs is important, but hesitation to make use of nonpharmacological interventions may mean missing golden opportunities for effective actions.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32760070/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008472";6/8/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9424

Patients with substance use disorders (SUD) have long and costly hospitalisations and higher readmission rates compared to those without SUD. Hospitalisation presents an opportunity to diagnose and treat individuals with SUD and connect them to ongoing care. However, SUD care often remains unaddressed by hospital providers due to lack of a systems approach and addiction medicine knowledge, and is compounded by stigma. We present a blueprint to launching an interprofessional inpatient addiction care team embedded in the hospital medicine division of an urban, safety-net integrated health system. We describe key factors for successful implementation including: (1) demonstrating the scope and impact of SUD in our health system via a needs assessment; (2) aligning improvement areas with health system leadership priorities; (3) involving executive leadership to create goal and initiative alignment; and (4) obtaining seed funding for a pilot programme from our Medicaid health plan partner.

In view of the scarcity of studies on the subject in this country, the objective of this research was to determine the signs and symptoms associated with the patients’ physical, social and psychological spheres that allow properly developing palliative care. A longitudinal, prospective and observational study was conducted with ACKD patients. In order to assess the symptomatic burden and suffering of these patients, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System Revised: renal (ESAS-r) for renal patients and the Distress Thermometer (DT) were used. The sample consisted of a total of 246 patients. The most common symptoms that affect them, causing them suffering in their daily lives, are those related to well-being, difficulty falling asleep and itching. It is necessary that health professionals adapt care measures and help patients undergoing renal treatment, especially those who have suffered the disease for a longer period of time, in order to alleviate the patients’ suffering and therefore improve their daily lives. To such an end, a care plan could be designed that includes early palliative care.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8157168/;16/5/2021;Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease;0.9126

1598;Policy opportunities and challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic for economies with large informal sectors;10.1057/s42214-020-00059-5;In the developing world, the informal economy can account for as much as 80% of the population. I focus on the urban component of informality, where both informal employment and informal enterprises are especially vulnerable to the pandemic-induced economic shock. I explain the complex nature of informality, some of the reasons for its persistence and its interdependency with the formal economy, especially in the manufacturing sector, through global value chains (GVCs). Large firms (whether MNEs or domestic firms) sub-contract considerable activity to informal enterprises, but this is precarious in character. I suggest the crisis provides the circumstances for greater active engagement with informal actors, by placing informal enterprises on a par with formal firms within industrial policy. I propose integration and registration, as opposed to formalisation, and the provision of state support without taxation. The role of the state is also crucial in matchmaking, creating incentives for GVCs to engage with informal actors systematically, and to reduce the transaction costs for informal actors in such engagement. These actions are likely to provide benefits in the longer run, even if they prove costly in the short run.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7316424/;25/6/2020;global value chains;0.9577

To reduce disease transmission, national regulatory agencies temporarily recommended curtailment of all nonurgent office visits and elective surgeries in March 2020, including vitreoretinal outpatient care in the USA. The effect of these guidelines on utilization of vitreoretinal care has not been explored to date. RECENT FINDINGS Retinal outpatient visits, new patient visits, intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections and in-office multimodal retinal imaging has seen a significant decline in utilization in the early phase of the pandemic. Intravitreal injections were performed at a comparatively higher rate than office visits. Utilization appeared to steadily increase in April 2020. Telemedicine visits, enabled by new national legislation for all areas of medicine, have been adopted to a modest degree by the retina community. SUMMARY In-office retinal care declined in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and national regulatory guidelines limiting nonurgent care.

The classical ACE-angiotensin Ⅱ (Ang II)-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in RAS system. ACE2 antagonises the activation of the classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and protects against lung injury. Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) also uses ACE2 for cell entry. ARDS is a clinical high-mortality disease which is probably due to the excessive activation of RAS caused by 2019-nCoV infection, and ACE2 has a protective effect on ARDS caused by COVID-19. Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on ARDS, the development of drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the near future. In the meantime, however, the use of RAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers that inhibit the damaging (ACE-Ang II) arm of the RAS cascade in the lung may also be promising.

Herein, we describe a case of a gastric GCT diagnosed preoperatively by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) and successfully resected by single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). CASE PRESENTATION A 46-year-old Japanese woman had a tumor located in the angle of the stomach that was approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a submucosal tumor (SMT), which was finally diagnosed as a gastric GCT using EUS-FNAB. The tumor was not identified by CT 1 year and 4 months before diagnosis; therefore, because there was a possibility that the tumor was malignant, we performed surgical wedge resection using SILS. The patient had an uneventful recovery postoperatively and was discharged without complications 3 days after surgery. The tumor was pathologically diagnosed as a benign GCT that remained within the muscular layer. No recurrence or complications have occurred in the first 16 months since the surgery. CONCLUSION Because gastric GCTs are generally benign and are rarely associated with lymph node metastasis, SILS seems to be a safe and feasible surgical approach for treating GCTs.";"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-020-00809-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32107653/";27/2/2020;Granular cell tumors;0.9131
1604;The Attend Study: A Retrospective Observational Study of Emergency Department Attendances During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic;10.7759/cureus.9328;Introduction: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic was associated with a large reduction in the number of attendances at emergency departments (EDs) in March 2020 in the United Kingdom (UK). We sought to identify which patient groups attended EDs least. Methods: Single-centre before and after study. We used routine administrative data from March 2020 and compared this to a composite control of March 2019 and February 2020. Results: Mean daily attendance fell by 30% from 342 patients per day in the composite control months to 242 patients per day in March 2020. Reductions in attendance were seen in almost all patient groups but were greatest in patients with injuries, those referred by another clinician, those arriving at the weekend, and in patients who received no investigations. Multivariate analysis revealed that the proportion of patients who were admitted to hospital fell, despite the patients being sicker, older, needing more investigations, and more likely to arrive by ambulance. Discussion: The reduction in ED attendances seen in the early phases of the UK pandemic occurred in all patient groups, but was greatest in the lower acuity patients. Reasons for this are complex and likely to be multifactorial.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32850205/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9328";21/7/2020;coronavirus disease-19;0.9484
1605;Test Automation with the Gauge Framework: Experience and Best Practices;10.1007/978-3-030-58802-1_33;While Behavior-driven development (BDD) tools such as Cucumber are powerful tools for automated testing, they have certain limitations. For example, they often enforce strict syntax for test cases, like the “Given-When-Then” format, which may not always be easy to write for a given test case. A new test automation framework named Gauge (gauge.org) addresses that limitation since it does not prescribe the BDD testing process with a strict syntax. In Gauge, writing a test case is as easy as writing down the flow of test cases in several itemized sentences in a natural language, like English. In the context of Testinium (testinium.com), a large software testing company which provides software testing services, tools and solutions to a large number of clients, we have actively used the Gauge framework since 2018 to develop large automated front-end test suites for several large web applications. In this paper/talk, the speakers will share several examples and best practices of developing automated tests in natural-language requirements using the Gauge framework. By learning from the ideas presented in the talk, readers (attendees) will be able to consider applying the Gauge framework in their own test automation projects.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978512/;19/8/2020;Behavior-driven development;0.9401

Russia is one of the most affected country for COVID-19 and significant death cases were recorded. A continuous seven-month data from 31 January to 23 August 2020 from different locations in the country was collected through the commonly available websites. COVID data (total cases (966189), daily new cases (11656), daily deaths (232), and total recovered (777960)) and meteorological parameters (temperature, dew, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed) were used for this analysis. The results show an increasing trend of daily new cases and daily deaths during lock down period, and it gradually decreased or stabilized in the post lock down period. It infers the effectiveness of movement control during the lock down period, that stops further spreading. The positive correlation between COVID cases and temperature indicate that the increase of temperature increases the spreading and vice versa. The negative relationship of humidity with death cases also facilitates the pandemic spread. Thus, the outcome of this study may help to address concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic among the public and policymakers.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323855129000334; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323855129000334";21/5/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.9629

1608;Prototype Similarity Learning for Activity Recognition;10.1007/978-3-030-47426-3_50;"Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays an irreplaceable role in various applications such as security, gaming, and assisted living. Recent studies introduce deep learning to mitigate the manual feature extraction (i.e., data representation) efforts and achieve high accuracy. However, there are still challenges in learning accurate representations for sensory data due to the weakness of representation modules and the subject variances. We propose a scheme called Distance-based HAR from Ensembled spatial-temporal Representations (DHARER) to address above challenges. The idea behind DHARER is straightforward—the same activities should have similar representations. We first learn representations of the input sensory segments and latent prototype representations of each class, using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based dual-stream representation module; then the learned representations are projected to activity types by measuring their similarity to the learned prototypes. We have conducted extensive experiments under a strict subject-independent setting on three large-scale datasets to evaluate the proposed scheme, and our experimental results demonstrate superior performance of DHARER to several state-of-the-art methods.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206173/;17/4/2020;Human Activity Recognition;0.9283
1609;Thousands Of Lives Could Be Saved In The US During The COVID-19 Pandemic If States Exchanged Ventilators.;10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00505;It is thought that there are not enough mechanical ventilators in the U.S. for every patient who may need one during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there is no analysis that measures the potential magnitude of the problem or proposes a solution. In this paper, I combine the pandemic forecasting model used by the federal government with estimates of ventilator availability from the literature to assess the expected shortage under various scenarios. I then propose that the federal government organize a national effort for ventilators to be exchanged between states to take advantage of the inter-temporal differences in demand peaks. I evaluate versions of this proposal, including use of the national stockpile, to estimate the number of lives that could be saved, and observe that it is potentially substantial. In the absence of other viable solutions, the government should begin this effort in earnest, and if not, preparations should be made for such coordination should the country face another pandemic in the future.

1610;Practical challenges in oral immunotherapy resolved through patient-centered care;10.1186/s13223-021-00533-6;Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is now widely recognized as a valid option for the management of IgE-mediated food allergies. However, in real-life practice, OIT can lead to a variety of unique situations where the best course of action is undetermined. In patient-centered care, individual patient preferences, needs and values, should guide all clinical decisions. This can be achieved by using shared-decision making and treatment customization to navigate areas of uncertainty in a way that is responsive to patient’s needs and preferences. However, in the context of OIT, lack of awareness of potential protocol adaptability or alternatives can become a barrier to treatment personalization. The purpose of this article is to review the theoretical bases of patient-centered care and shared decision-making and their practical implication for the patient-centered delivery of OIT. Clinical cases highlighting common challenges in real-life OIT practice are presented along with a discussion of potential personalized management options to be considered. While the practice of OIT is bound to evolve as additional scientific and experiential knowledge is gained, it should always remain rooted in the general principles of patient-centered care.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971360/;18/3/2021;Oral immunotherapy;0.9313

We assessed the role of political partisanship in individuals' compliance with physical distancing recommendations of political leaders using data on mobility from a sample of mobile phones in 3,100 counties in the United States during March 2020, county-level partisan preferences, information about the political affiliation of state governors, and the timing of their communications about COVID-19 prevention. Regression analyses examined how political preferences influenced the association between governors' COVID-19 communications and residents' mobility patterns. Governors' recommendations for residents to stay at home preceded stay-at-home orders and led to a significant reduction in mobility that was comparable to the effect of the orders themselves. Effects were larger in Democratic- than in Republican-leaning counties, a pattern more pronounced under Republican governors. Democratic-leaning counties also responded more strongly to recommendations from Republican than from Democratic governors.

1613;Does vitamin D deficiency increase the severity of COVID-19?;10.7861/clinmed.2020-0301;The severity of coronavirus 2019 infection (COVID-19) is determined by the presence of pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), myocarditis, microvascular thrombosis and/or cytokine storms, all of which involve underlying inflammation. A principal defence against uncontrolled inflammation, and against viral infection in general, is provided by T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs). Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19. If vitamin D does in fact reduce the severity of COVID-19 in regard to pneumonia/ARDS, inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and thrombosis, it is our opinion that supplements would offer a relatively easy option to decrease the impact of the pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32503801/";5/6/2020;coronavirus 2019 infection;0.9785

METHODS: A COVID‐19 specific briefing and debriefing form was created and used in the OR along with the World Health Organization surgical safety checklist to reinforce the use of appropriate PPE. An audit was subsequently done to understand the compliance to PPE use, followed by a survey based on the findings of the audit to understand the issues related to noncompliance. RESULTS: The form was used in 183 out of the 238 (77%) surgeries performed during a months' time. The overall compliance for PPE usage was 96.3%. Noncompliance was seen most often for eye protection (45/567) (P = .01). The survey revealed that this was mostly among surgeons mainly due to discomfort, poor visibility, and frequent fogging. CONCLUSIONS: Our HCW were adapting well to the new normal of donning appropriate PPE in the OR, except for the eye protection due to discomfort and visibility related issues.

CRDs affect multiple components of respiratory system, including the airways, parenchyma, and pulmonary vasculature. Although noncommunicable respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), cystic fibrosis (CF), and lung cancer (LC), account for enormous disease burden, the currently available therapies only focus on alleviating the symptoms of diseases rather than providing optimal treatment and/or prevention. Similarly a major respiratory communicable disease, that is, tuberculosis (TB), is associated with the challenge of increasingly developing antibiotic resistance in the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In light of these challenges, we aim to summarize the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to hallmark pathophysiology of CRDs. Moreover, we will also highlight the limitations of current therapeutic strategies and explore novel drug delivery options that may be potentially more effective in the management of CRDs.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128206584000017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128206584000017";18/9/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9635

Its severe clinical manifestations associated with the need for admission into Intensive Care Units and high mortality rate represent a therapeutic challenge for the medical community. Currently, there is no drug approved for its treatment and different therapeutic options are being essayed to address pathophysiological processes underlying the clinical manifestations experienced by patients. New and old drugs, whether as a single treatment or in combination, in immunologically compromised patients may favour the development of adverse drug reactions (ADR), including drug hypersensitivity, which must be identified and managed accordingly. Given the lack of community immunity and the high rate of virus contagion, it is expected that new cases will emerge in the upcoming months. Thus, the probability of more adverse reactions or even new clinical manifestations may increase in the near future.

1621;Redox Role of ROS and Inflammation in Pulmonary Diseases.;10.1007/978-3-030-68748-9_11;Reactive oxygen species (ROS), either derived from exogenous sources or overproduced endogenously, can disrupt the body's antioxidant defenses leading to compromised redox homeostasis. The lungs are highly susceptible to ROS-mediated damage. Oxidative stress (OS) caused by this redox imbalance leads to the pathogenesis of multiple pulmonary diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). OS causes damage to important cellular components in terms of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA histone modification. Inflammation further enhances ROS production inducing changes in transcriptional factors which mediate cellular stress response pathways. This deviation from normal cell function contributes to the detrimental pathological characteristics often seen in pulmonary diseases. Although antioxidant therapies are feasible approaches in alleviating OS-related lung impairment, a comprehensive understanding of the updated role of ROS in pulmonary inflammation is vital for the development of optimal treatments. In this chapter, we review the major pulmonary diseases-including COPD, asthma, ARDS, COVID-19, and lung cancer-as well as their association with ROS.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68748-9_11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019270/";1/1/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9661

Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, those with underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Slower clearance of the virus was associated with a higher risk of progression to critical condition. As of March 6, 2020, 268 (89.9%) patients were discharged and the overall case fatality ratio was 1.0%. CONCLUSIONS In a designated hospital outside Hubei Province, COVID-2019 patients could be effectively managed by properly using the existing hospital system. Mortality may be lowered when cases are relatively mild and there are sufficient medical resources to care and treat the disease.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32239761/";2/4/2020;novel coronavirus disease;0.912
1624;Triphenyl phosphate exposure induces kidney structural damage and gut microbiota disorders in mice under different diets.;10.1016/j.envint.2020.106054;"Exposure of humans to organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and the consequent health risk have increased owing to the latter's widespread application. Although triphenyl phosphate (TPP), an OPFR, is a potential chemical determinant of liver function damage, its effects on kidney function in mice under high fructose/fat (HFF) diet are still unclear. In this study, C57BL/6J mice were fed HFF to generate an obesity model and mice were exposed to low dose (0.01 mg/kg/day; TPP-L) and high dose (1 mg/kg/day; TPP-H) of TPP for 12 weeks. Results showed that TPP-L and TPP-H combined with HFF, as well as TPP-H alone, caused kidney structural damage and gut microbiota disorders in mice. Inflammatory response induced by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB p65)/nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and caspase-3 promoted kidney structure damage, as well as accumulation of triglyceride and total cholesterol and the protein residues in urine. Although TPP-L did not cause obvious structural damage in the kidneys, 0.01 mg/kg TPP induced significant inflammation and gut microbiota disorders. These findings provide new insights regarding health risk assessment after chronic exposure to TPP and HFF alone, as well as a combination of TPP with HFF in mice.";"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.106054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818822/";17/8/2020;organophosphate flame retardants;0.9131

In particular, several cases of recovered patients have been reported after being treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (which is widely used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection) in combination with the anti-flu drug oseltamivir. In addition, remdesivir, which has been previously administered to Ebola virus patients, has also proven effective in the U.S. against coronavirus, while antimalarial chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and co-administered darunavir and umifenovir (in patient therapies) were also recently recorded as having anti-SARS CoV-2 effects. Since the recoveries/deaths ratio in the last weeks significantly increased, especially in China, it is clear that the experimental antiviral therapy, together with the availability of intensive care unit beds in hospitals and rigorous government control measures, all play an important role in dealing with this virus. This also stresses the urgent need for the scientific community to devote its efforts to find other more specific antiviral strategies.;"https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867327666200416131117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32297571/";16/4/2020;COronaVIrus Disease 19;0.9189
1626;The effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: A modeling study;10.1101/2020.05.22.20109660;Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are founded to be effective to delay epidemic spread and to reduce the number of patients. Moderate NPIs took in Japan seemed to have reduced the COVID-19 patients and to lower death rates, thus, effects of those NPIs are worthy of investigation. We used open source data and divided the data into three periods: Jan 22 to Feb 25 (Period I), Feb 26 to Apr 6 (Period II), and Apr 7 to May 14 (Period III). We developed the SIRD model and applied the Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate a combination of optimal results, including the peak of infected cases, the peak date, and R0. For Period I, the estimated peak infected cases were smaller than the observed ones, the peak date was earlier than the observed one, and the R0 was about 4.66. For the other two periods, the estimated cases were more, and the peak dates were earlier than the observed ones. The R0 was 2.50 in Period II, and 1.79 in Period III. NPIs took in Japan might have reduced more than 50% of the daily contacts per people compared to that before COVID-19. Owing to the effects of NPIs, the Japanese society had avoided collapse of medical service. Nevertheless, the capacity of daily RT-PCR may have restricted the reported confirmed cases.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.22.20109660v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109660";23/5/2020;Non-pharmaceutical interventions;0.96

In 2018, over 10 million people age 12 years or older misused opioids.Substance use is also correlated with increased physical and mental health disorders, and developmental challenges among youths. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) has been reported to reduce mortality, opioid use, and human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus transmission while increasing treatment retention in adults. The San Bernardino County Youth Opioid Response (SBCYOR) program was formed to explore best practices for youths at risk of opioid use disorders and/or overdose. SBCYOR is a coalition of professionals in healthcare, behavioral health, public education, law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS) agencies, and juvenile detention centers throughout San Bernardino County, California. SBCYOR focuses on high-risk and addicted individuals between the ages of 12 to 24 years in San Bernardino County’s correctional system. It utilizes a strategy of collaboration, prevention, risk mitigation, medication, psychological treatment, and community outreach.

1629;The Use of Smartphone Fitness Applications: The Role of Self-Efficacy and Self-Regulation;10.3390/ijerph17207639;With the popularity of the health and wellness trend in recent years, smartphone fitness applications have become more and more popular. Thus, this study explored factors affecting the behavioral intention to use and the actual usage behavior of smartphone fitness apps from technical, health, and social perspectives by integrating the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). We examined whether perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, social influence, self-efficacy, goal-setting, and self-monitoring predict usage behavior. Based on the survey responses of 1066 smartphone fitness apps users, we revealed that all of the variables, except for self-monitoring, significantly influence usage behavior, while behavioral intention acts as a total mediator between perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use and usage behavior. Drawing on the research findings, we suggest that influencing behavioral intention to use a fitness app can be an effective method to increase its adoption. Therefore, app developers need to pay attention to interventions that seek to enhance the usefulness of the app, provide professional counseling, as well as an opportunity for effortless goal setting features.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092090/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17207639";20/10/2020;Social Cognitive Theory;0.9306

In patients undergoing immunotherapy, current treatment should be continued to prevent exacerbation of symptoms; however, exceptions to this include high-risk patients for COVID-19, such as the elderly, those with comorbidities including cardiac and respiratory diseases, those taking therapy with immunosuppressive agents, and those with deteriorating symptoms of COVID-19.";"https://doi.org/10.11477/mf.1416201652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33051396/";1/10/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9927
1632;Evaluation of home detection algorithms on mobile phone data using individual-level ground truth;10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00284-9;Inferring mobile phone users’ home location, i.e., assigning a location in space to a user based on data generated by the mobile phone network, is a central task in leveraging mobile phone data to study social and urban phenomena. Despite its widespread use, home detection relies on assumptions that are difficult to check without ground truth, i.e., where the individual who owns the device resides. In this paper, we present a dataset that comprises the mobile phone activity of sixty-five participants for whom the geographical coordinates of their residence location are known. The mobile phone activity refers to Call Detail Records (CDRs), eXtended Detail Records (XDRs), and Control Plane Records (CPRs), which vary in their temporal granularity and differ in the data generation mechanism. We provide an unprecedented evaluation of the accuracy of home detection algorithms and quantify the amount of data needed for each stream to carry out successful home detection for each stream. Our work is useful for researchers and practitioners to minimize data requests and maximize the accuracy of the home antenna location.

In this article, we provide a short overview of SCP and the importance of health-related self-management. RESULTS: The broad definition of “survivorship” and the high diversity of impairments among cancer survivors warrants a personalized and multidimensional approach. This in turn requires both interdisciplinary and integrated care. To date, the state of knowledge on the efficacy of SCP is limited. A central aim of SCP is to increase health-related self-management, which in turn requires the ability to correctly evaluate and apply health-related information in order to resolve health-related problems (health literacy). Due to the technological developments, additional skills are needed to stay health literate (digital health literacy). CONCLUSION: Further research on the efficacy of SCP is warranted. Both advantages and risks of digital health programs need to be carefully weighed to avoid inequalities in health care (“digital divide”). Specific education programs to improve digital health literacy may help to minimize such risks.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00761-021-00945-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935378/";23/4/2021;Survivorship care programs;0.9216
1634;Transmission and reduction of aerosols in classrooms using air purifier systems;10.1063/5.0044046;SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) as an airborne respiratory disease led to a bunch of open questions: how teaching in classrooms is possible and how the risk of infection can be reduced, e.g., by the use of air purifier systems. In this study, the transmission of aerosols in a classroom is analyzed numerically and experimentally. The aerosol concentration in a classroom equipped with an air purifier system was measured with an aerosol spectrometer (optical particle sizer, TSI Incorporated) at different locations. The transient reduction of the aerosol concentration, which was artificially generated by an aerosol generator (di-ethyl hexyl sebacate-atomizer, detected particle size ranging from 0.3 to 10 μm), was monitored. The experimental results were used to validate a numerical simulation model of the classroom using the Open Source Computational Fluid Dynamics code OpenFOAM® (version 6). With the numerical simulation model, different scenarios with infected persons in the room have been analyzed, showing that the air purifier system leads to a significant reduction of airborne particles in the room dependent on the location of the infected person.

It remains unclear as to why proper hand hygiene practices cannot be sustained and what role health literacy plays in older adults fight against infectious diseases. METHODS: A convenience sample of 433 old adults aged 65 and above was recruited. Their hygiene practices and health literacy were evaluated using a structured questionnaire adopted from the Centre for Health Protection and the Chinese version of the HLS-Asia-Q questionnaire. RESULTS: The percentage distribution of the hand hygiene performance, from always to never, was 18%-10%. A majority 63.28% (274) of them were classified as having inadequate health literacy (0-25), while a meager 1.62% (7) of them as having excellent health literacy (42.01-50). The Spearman correlation showed a significant positive relationship (P < 0.05) between the participants’ health literacy and their hand hygiene practices.

Cases were analyzed for epidemiological data and were confirmed by real-time PCR. Findings: Of the 213 cases (108 men and 105 women) , 88 (41%) had exposure to Wuhan. The median age was 48 years ( range,2-88 years;IQR,35-58.5). Thirty-three severe patients with a median age of 66 years(range,33-82 years,IQR, 57-76) were treated in intensive care units; out of these patients, 66.7 %(22) were men and 19 (57.5%) had chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, stroke, and renal insufficiency. Under the controlled measures, the number of new patients gradually decreased and nearly disappeared after 20 days.

We collected monthly longitudinal data from fourteen infants born preterm between the adjusted ages of 56 and 295 days for a total of 37 sessions of EEG data. Alpha band power at motor cortices and cross-regional connectivity do not present consistent changing trends at the group level in infants born preterm. Individual level analysis reveals that infants born preterm are a heterogeneous group with subtypes of neural function development, some presenting similar changing trends as observed in the typically developing group while others present atypical patterns. This may be linked to the variability in developmental outcomes in infants born preterm. This study was a critical first step to support EEG as a potential tool for identifying and quantifying the developmental trajectories of neuromotor control in infants born preterm.;"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82329-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33574372/";11/2/2021;Electroencephalography;0.9409
1638;The Cross Validation in Automated Valuation Models: A Proposal for Use;10.1007/978-3-030-58814-4_45;The appraisal of large amounts of properties is often entrusted to Automated Valuation Models (AVM). At one time, only econometric models were used for this purpose. More recently, also machine learning models are used in mass appraisal techniques. The literature has devoted much attention to assessing the performance capabilities of these models. Verification tests first train a model on a training set, then measure the prediction error of the model on a set of data not met before: the testing set. The prediction error is measured with an accuracy indicator. However, verification on the testing set alone may be insufficient to describe the model’s performance. In addition, it may not detect the existence of model bias such as overfitting. This research proposes the use of cross validation to provide a more complete and effective evaluation of models. Ten-fold cross validation is used within 5 models (linear regression, regression tree, random forest, nearest neighbors, multilayer perception) in the assessment of 1,400 properties in the city of Turin. The results obtained during validation provide additional information for the evaluation of the models. This information cannot be provided by the accuracy measurement when considered alone.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974337/;26/8/2020;Automated Valuation Models;0.9069

In this study, a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) was developed for the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) that was more sensitive than ELISA (98% vs 87%). The MMIA was then applied and validated in 264 first responders in Colorado using serum and dried blood spot (DBS) eluates, compared to ELISA and evaluated for neutralizing antibodies. Four percent (11/264) of first responders were seropositive in July-August 2020. Serum and DBS were highly correlated for anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies (R=0.83, p<0.0001 and R=0.87, p<0.0001, respectively) by MMIA. The MMIA accurately predicted SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using DBS (R=0.76, p=0.037). On repeat antibody testing three months later, anti-RBD IgG decreased less rapidly than anti-N IgG measured by MMIA, with a median change in gMFI of 62% vs 79% (p<0.01), for anti-RBD and anti-N IgG respectively.

1642;The optimal diagnostic methods for COVID-19.;10.1515/dx-2020-0058;As the world continues to study and understand coronavirus disease (COVID-19), existing investigations and tests have been used to try and detect the virus to slow viral transmission and its global spread. A 'gold-standard' investigation has not yet been identified for detection and monitoring. Initially, computed tomography (CT) was the mainstay investigation as it shows the disease severity and recovery, and its images change at different stages of the disease. However, CT has been found to have limited sensitivity and negative predictive value in the early stages of the disease, and the value of its use has come under debate due to whether its images change the treatment plan, the risk of radiation, as well as its practicality with infection control. Therefore, there has been a shift to the use of other imaging modalities and tests, such as chest X-rays and ultrasound. Furthermore, the use of nucleic acid-based testing such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have proven useful with direct confirmation of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we aim to review and analyse current literature to compare RT-PCR, immunological biomarkers, chest radiographs, ultrasound and chest CT scanning as methods of diagnosing COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1515/dx-2020-0058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32621728/";6/7/2020;coronavirus disease;0.991

Although viral infection can contribute to acute exacerbation of interstitial lung diseases, few studies have identified a relationship between acute exacerbations and viral infections. The present study aimed to prospectively clarify the role of viral infection in patients showing acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease in Japan. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from patients with acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease between May 2017 and February 2019. Respiratory viruses were detected by the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel FAST v2 RUO kit and the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel assay. RESULTS: Three of 29 patients demonstrated respiratory viral infection during acute exacerbation of interstitial lung diseases. The infectious agents were identified as respiratory syncytial virus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus, and influenza A virus and rhino/enterovirus in the three patients, respectively.

1644;Investigation of ventilation conditions associated with CO2 concentration changes in ultrasonographic exam room from the perspective of COVID-19 infection control;10.1101/2021.03.01.21252598;Objectives Ventilation is an important factor in preventing COVID-19 infection. To clarify the state of ventilation in ultrasonic exam rooms, as an index of ventilation rate, the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in our exam rooms was measured. Methods We measured the CO2 concentration in each exam room before the examination and 0-15 minutes after end of the exam. The subjects were 70 cases (abdomen: 24, breast: 16, neck: 16, and musculoskeletal: 14). In infant cases, one parent accompanied the patient during the examination. Results The highest CO2 concentration was 2261 ppm, observed after the breast examination. In all cases, the CO2 concentration in the exam room was highest immediately after the examination or two minutes after. Almost all cases had recovered to within 120% of the pre-examination CO2 concentrations within 15 minutes after the examination. The average CO2 concentration after ultrasonography was significantly higher for breast examinations than others. Conclusions Even in a hospital with modern ventilation equipment, the CO2 concentration in the ultrasound room was high after the exam and it takes 15 minutes to recover to the pre-exam state. Care must be taken to ensure adequate ventilation in ultrasonographic facilities.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.21252598v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252598";2/3/2021;Objectives Ventilation;0.953
1645;Severe secondary hyperkalemia and arrhythmia from drug interactions between calcium‐channel blocker and voriconazole: a case presentation;10.1186/s12882-021-02370-6;BACKGROUND: Patients with kidney disease may have concurrent hypertension and infection. Dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (CCB) are the most popular class of antihypertensive drugs used in clinical settings and can be metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). Voriconazole is a commonly used antifungal treatment and a CYP3A4-inhibitor. Insufficient attention to drug interactions from the concomitant use of CCB and voriconazole may result in serious adverse reactions. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a patient with acute kidney injury on stable anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody associated vasculitis who developed hyperkalemia resulting in sinus arrest with junctional escape rhythm attributed to drug interactions of CCB with voriconazole. This is a very rarely reported case and may be an under-recognized complication. After continuous renal replacement therapy and changing the anti-hypertensive drugs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities of the patient fully recovered. CONCLUSIONS: This case warns us of severe consequences of drug interactions. Co-prescription of CYP3A4-inhibitors with calcium-channel blockers increases the risk of hypotension and acute kidney injury, which may further induce hyperkalemia and arrhythmia.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971831/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-021-02370-6";10/5/2021;Patients with kidney disease may have concurrent hypertension and infection;0.9078
1646;Combined system for wastewater treatment: Ozonization and coagulation via tannin-based agent for harvesting microalgae by dissolved air flotation.;10.1080/09593330.2020.1830181;This study evaluated the performance of urban wastewater treatment in pilot-plant by an integrated system consisting of anaerobic reactor, microalgae cultivation, Venturi tube ozone recirculation, coagulation/flocculation with tannin-based agent natural coagulant, and dissolved air flotation (DAF). Ozone concentrations (without ozone, 0.13 and 0.25 mg O3/mg of biomass) and tannin dosages (65, 85 and 105 mg/L) were evaluated regarding microalgae separation and their influences on wastewater treatment performance. During the experiments, it was verified that the treatment efficiency increased when ozone was applied and with higher tannin dosages. The best results were found with 0.13 mg O3/mg of biomass and 105 mg/L of tannin, obtaining excellent removal of turbidity removal (99.4%), apparent color at 420 nm (94.5%), TN (83.2%), N-NH3 (100%), TOC (86.8%), BOD5 (86.5%) and COD (100%), 47.6% reduction in electric conductivity, 46.1% in TDS, 66.4% TP removal for the integrated system and 84% microalgae biomass recovery were obtained.

The current study aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol when administered alone and in combination with nicotinamide against alcohol-aflatoxin B1-induced HCC. Results reveal that during the development and progression of cancer, there was a decline in the level of antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase (GR), antioxidant glutathione, and glutathione S-transferase, which is an enzyme of detoxification pathways. Treatment of resveratrol restored the level of catalase and glutathione peroxidase toward normal in alcohol-aflatoxin B1-induced HCC; however, nicotinamide worked in concert with resveratrol only in upregulating the activity of glutathione reductase, glutathione level, and glutathione S-transferase. SIRT1 agonist resveratrol was observed to modulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes by negatively regulating the expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in alcohol-aflatoxin B1-induced HCC, thereby suggesting a cross-talk between antioxidant enzymes SIRT1 and NF-κB during the development and progression of HCC and its therapeutics by resveratrol and nicotinamide.";"https://doi.org/10.1002/jbt.22625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894639/";7/9/2020;Hepatocellular carcinoma;0.9459
1648;Effect of acute kidney injury on weaning from mechanical ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases patients with respiratory failure;10.1186/s43168-020-00013-2;BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) worsens the outcome in mechanically ventilated patients. The occurrence of AKI may have an effect on weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV). The purpose of this work is to study the effect of AKI on weaning from MV for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with respiratory failure (RF). The study included 100 mechanically ventilated COPD patients with RF. Patients were classified into group 1, mechanically ventilated COPD patients with type 2 RF who developed AKI, and group 2, mechanically ventilated COPD patients with type 2 RF, who did not develop AKI. RESULTS: The age of the studied group ranged between 46 and 80 years, and serum creatinine on admission was within normal. There is a significant difference in a serum creatinine level after 2 days and after 1 week of MV in an intensive care unit (ICU) among AKI cases. There is a significant difference in weaning success between AKI and non-AKI patients with much higher weaning success in non-AKI group. Also, there is a significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in AKI patients after 48 h of admission. CONCLUSIONS: AKI is frequent in COPD patients within 48 h of ICU admission and MV increases the risk of AKI in COPD patients.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7371816/;21/7/2020;Acute kidney injury;0.9084

A systematic review using PRISMA methodology was conducted on behavioral therapy for adolescent OUD. Only three studies were identified. Combined evidence from two studies indicates initial efficacy of the Adolescent-Community Reinforcement Approach, motivational enhancement therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for reducing opioid use. The only group therapy identified, which involved adolescents and their parents, demonstrated improvement in participants' knowledge of relapse-prevention strategies, drug-refusal skills, and overall psychosocial functioning. Additional studies that included behavioral therapy but that did not specifically test its efficacy are also highlighted to expand the understanding of the small literature base. This review highlights the sparse evidence base for these therapies in this population. In addition, we highlight promising areas for future research and include evidence from the adult literature that may inform that research.

With a quick spread of the outbreak from its origin, Wuhan, China, to almost all over the world, it has affected more than seven million people to date, hence it has devastated every part of the infrastructural skeleton of governance. Continuously escalating disease burden and lack of proven therapeutic approaches are mounting challenges to health scientists and ultimately to healthcare providers. Although recent studies have shown benefits in decreasing the severity and duration of the illness and there are more benefits compared to risks, plasma therapy cannot be considered as a standard of care until the ongoing trials are completed and they establish definite evidence on its therapeutic efficacy and safety. Though a beneficial aspect may be there, acquiring donors and adequate availability of plasma is equally challenging, and its associated untoward effects related to biological therapeutic agents.

1651;Glyconanomaterials for Human Virus Detection and Inhibition.;10.3390/nano11071684;Viruses are among the most infectious pathogens, responsible for the highest death toll around the world. Lack of effective clinical drugs for most viral diseases emphasizes the need for speedy and accurate diagnosis at early stages of infection to prevent rapid spread of the pathogens. Glycans are important molecules which are involved in different biological recognition processes, especially in the spread of infection by mediating virus interaction with endothelial cells. Thus, novel strategies based on nanotechnology have been developed for identifying and inhibiting viruses in a fast, selective, and precise way. The nanosized nature of nanomaterials and their exclusive optical, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical features can improve patient care through using sensors with minimal invasiveness and extreme sensitivity. This review provides an overview of the latest advances of functionalized glyconanomaterials, for rapid and selective biosensing detection of molecules as biomarkers or specific glycoproteins and as novel promising antiviral agents for different kinds of serious viruses, such as the Dengue virus, Ebola virus, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, Zika virus, or coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).;"https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11071684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206886/";26/6/2021;coronavirus SARS-CoV-2;0.9242

To examine the spatiotemporal changes in the transmission potential, we present regional estimates of the doubling time and reproduction number (Rt ) of COVID-19 in the country. Methods Daily series of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the most affected regions were extracted from publicly available sources. We employed established mathematical and statistical methods to investigate the time-varying reproduction numbers of the COVID-19 in Korea and its doubling time, respectively. Results At the regional level, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province have experienced the first peak of COVID-19 in early March, followed by the second wave in early June, withRt exceeding 3.0 and mean doubling time ranging from 3.6 to 10.1 days. As of 19 July, 2020, Gyeongbuk Province and Daegu are yet to experience a second wave of the disease, where the mean Rt reached 3.5-4.4 and doubling time ranging from 2.8 to 4.6 days during the first wave.

The results of preclinical experiments and clinical trials have demonstrated that MSC-derived secretome possesses immunoregulatory and reparative abilities and that this secretome is capable of modulating innate and adaptive immunity and reprograming the metabolism of recipient cells via paracrine mechanisms. It has been recognized that MSC-derived secretome, including soluble proteins (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases), extracellular vesicles (EVs) and organelles, plays a key role in tissue repair and regeneration in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary arterial hypertension, and silicosis. This review summarizes the known functions of MSC-EV modulation in lung diseases, coupled with the future challenges of MSC-EVs as a new pharmaceutical agent.

On one hand, understanding the elements’ formation and their specific properties related to their electronic and nucleonic structure may lead to understanding whether future solutions to replace certain elements or materials for specific technical applications are realistic. On the other hand, finding solutions to the critical availability of some of these elements is an urgent need. Even the analysis of the availability of scarce minerals from European Union sources leads to the suggestion that a wide-ranging approach is essential. These two fundamental assumptions represent also the logical approach that led the European Commission to ask for a multi-disciplinary effort from the scientific community to tackle the challenge of Critical Raw Materials.

Health policies and practices have attracted particular attention in terms of human and financial cost. Before COVID-19, chronic kidney disease was already considered a risk multiplier in patients with diabetes and hypertension, the two now being the major risk factors for COVID-19 infection and adverse outcome. In contrast to the urgent need for action, the nephrology field is considered to be in a state of stagnation regarding the management of chronic kidney disease patients who still experience unacceptably high morbidity and mortality. Ironically and paradoxically in a field lacking robust clinical trials, clinical practice is driven by guidelines-based medicine on weak evidence. The Emperor’s syndrome, referring to Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale, has been described in medicine as voluntary blindness to an obvious truth, being a weak evidence-based therapeutic intervention or weak health care. A promising positive example of improving heart and kidney outcomes is the emerging treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.

Cachexia is associated with several acute and chronic disease states such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart and kidney failure, and acquired and autoimmune diseases and also pharmacological treatments such as chemotherapy. The clinical relevance of cachexia and its impact on patients’ quality of life has been neglected for decades. Only recently did the international community agree upon a definition of the term cachexia, and we are still awaiting the standardization of markers and tests for the diagnosis and staging of cancer-related cachexia. In this review, we discuss cachexia, considering the evolving use of the term for diagnostic purposes and the implications it has for clinical biomarkers, to provide a comprehensive overview of its biology and clinical management. Advances and tools developed so far for the in vitro testing of cachexia and drug screening will be described.

The accessibility of primary care facilities is therefore very important. In this study we analysed comparative data on physical accessibility of general practices (GP practices) in 31 (mainly) European countries. METHODS We used data from the QUALICOPC study, conducted in 2011 among GPs in 34 (mainly European) countries and constructed a physical accessibility scale. We applied multilevel analysis to assess the differences between and within countries and to test hypotheses, related to characteristics of the practices and of the countries. RESULTS We found large differences between countries and a strong clustering of physical accessibility within countries. Physical accessibility was negatively related to the age of the GPs, and was less in single-handed and in inner city practices. Of the country variables only the length of the period of social democratic government participation during the previous decades was positively related to physical accessibility. CONCLUSION A large share of the variation in physical accessibility of GP practices was on the level of countries.

However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images, the classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and a deep CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC), for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability of DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 cases from a comprehensive image dataset collected from several hospitals around the world. High accuracy of 93.1% (with a sensitivity of 100%) was achieved by DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 X-ray images from normal, and severe acute respiratory syndrome cases.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7474514/;5/9/2020;Chest X-ray;0.9163
1665;Does Herding Behaviour Among Traders Increase During Covid 19 Pandemic? Evidence from the Cryptocurrency Market;10.1007/978-3-030-64849-7_17;Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies and trading these currencies have gained huge momentum in recent years. The sophisticated features, complexities on regulatory framework, and high volatility of Cryptocurrencies would pose trading challenges to new investors and/or investors with limited knowledge. Investors generally are influenced by fund managers, financial analysts or other investors who are considered as well informed and highly knowledgeable peers. Investors mimic their behaviour to perform trading activities and such behaviour is termed as Herding. Covid 19 pandemic triggered severe uncertainties in the cryptocurrencies market and has led to wide fluctuations in prices causing severe volatility and market crashes. This paper aims to examine the herding behaviour in cryptocurrency market during the pre Covid 19 and Covid 19 pandemic period using the Cross-Sectional Standard Deviation (CSSD) approach. The findings of the paper reveal that herding was evident among all the ten crypto-currencies in normal market conditions of the entire sample period but not during market upswing or downswing. However, the herding behaviour was present in the cryptocurrencies Litecoin, Cardano and Dash during the Covid 19 pandemic period in all market conditions.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978959/;10/11/2020;Cross-Sectional Standard Deviation;0.9124
1666;An overview of the gut side of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.;10.5217/ir.2020.00087;In late 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiated in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The major clinical symptoms described for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) include respiratory distress and pneumonia in severe cases, and some patients may experience gastrointestinal impairments. In accordance, viral RNA or live infectious virus have been detected in feces of patients with COVID-19. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a vital pathway for the virus entry into human cells, including those of the respiratory mucosa, esophageal epithelium as well as the absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor may decrease the receptor expression and disrupt the function of B0AT1 transporter influencing the diarrhea observed in COVID-19 patients. In this context, a fecal-oral transmission route has been considered and points out a role for the digestive tract in disease transmission and severity. Here, in order to further understand the impact of COVID-19 in human physiology, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity are discussed in the context of gastrointestinal disturbances.;"https://doi.org/10.5217/ir.2020.00087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142370/";6/11/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9849
1667;Nature as an Ecological Asset for Positive Youth Development: Empirical Evidence From Rural Communities;10.3389/fpsyg.2021.688574;Despite increasing emphasis on youth contact with nature and associated benefits, research has not examined the direct relationship between adolescents' nature-based experiences and holistic measures of positive youth development (PYD). This gap may stem from the lack of interdisciplinary work on nature and PYD. Our study integrates multiple disciplinary perspectives to explore direct associations between time in nature, connection to nature, and the five Cs of PYD (competence, connection, confidence, character, and caring) as well as the “sixth” C of contribution. From 2015 to 2016, we collected data from 587 diverse South Carolina middle school students (57% female, 40% BIPOC) between the ages of 11 and 14 (M(age) = 12.9) and living in predominantly low-income communities. OLS regression analyses indicated that across all youth, self-reported connection to nature was a consistent positive correlate of overall PYD and each of the individual Cs. Time in nature was associated with overall PYD and competence. Findings demonstrate significant associations between nature-based experiences and PYD and underscore the importance of ensuring that diverse youth can access and enjoy the developmental benefits of nature and nature-based recreation opportunities.;"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.688574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149575/";4/6/2021;positive youth development;0.9023
1668;The Psychological and Quality of Life Impacts on Women in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 Pandemic.;10.3390/ijerph18136734;The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a global health crisis. The adverse impacts on Asian women, including those in Hong Kong, are substantial. This cross-sectional online study examined the impacts of COVID-19 on Hong Kong women, including psychological effects, self-belief in coping, and quality of life, and was conducted over 4 weeks from July to August 2020. Females aged over 18, living in Hong Kong, and that could read Chinese, were included. Among 417 participants, 50.8% were aged below 50, 66.7% were married, 57.1% were caregivers, 61.4% had a family income of <USD 2600, and 70.3% attained higher secondary education or above. The results show that 32.2%, 42.4%, and 44.9% of participants had negative emotions of stress, anxiety, and depression. There are significant negative correlations between emotional state and different aspects of quality of life, but positive correlations between general self-efficacy and different aspects of quality of life. COVID-19 induced significant psychological and quality of life impacts on females in Hong Kong. The policymakers, healthcare professionals, and social support organizations should establish appropriate strategies and policies to support women during the COVID-19 pandemic or similar future crises.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201456/";23/6/2021;coronavirus;0.9493
1669;The Potential Use of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Their Derived Exosomes for Orthopedic Diseases Treatment;10.1007/s12015-021-10185-z;Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are conditions that can affect muscles, bones, and joints. These disorders are very painful and severely limit patients' mobility and are more common in the elderly. MSCs are multipotent stem cells isolated from embryonic (such as the umbilical cord) and mature sources (such as adipose tissue and bone marrow). These cells can differentiate into various cells such as osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, NP-like cells, Etc. Due to MSC characteristics such as immunomodulatory properties, ability to migrate to the site of injury, recruitment of cells involved in repair, production of growth factors, and large amount production of extracellular vesicles, these cells have been used in many regenerative-related medicine studies. Also, MSCs produce different types of EVs, such as exosomes, to the extracellular environment. Exosomes reflect MSCs' characteristics and do not have cell therapy-associated problems because they are cell-free. These vesicles carry proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids to the host cell and change their function. This review focuses on MSCs and MSCs exosomes' role in repairing dense connective tissues such as tendons, cartilage, invertebrate disc, bone fracture, and osteoporosis treatment.

1670;COVID-19 Fatality and Comorbidity Risk Factors among Confirmed Patients in Mexico;10.1101/2020.04.21.20074591;As of April 18, 2020, 2.16 million patients in the world had been tested positive with Coronavirus (COVID-19) and 146,088 had died, which accounts for a case fatality rate of 6.76%. In Mexico, according to official statistics (April 18), 7,497 cases have been confirmed with 650 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 8.67%. These estimates, however, may not reflect the final fatality risk among COVID-19 confirmed patients, because they are based on cross-sectional counts of diagnosed and deceased patients, and therefore are not adjusted by time of exposure and right-censorship. In this paper we estimate fatality risks based on survival analysis methods, calculated from individual-level data on symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID-19 recently released by the Mexican Ministry of Health. The estimated fatality risk after 35 days of onset of symptoms is 12.38% (95% CI: 11.37-13.47). Fatality risks sharply rise with age, and significantly increase for males (59%) and individuals with comorbidities (38%-168%, depending on the disease). Two reasons may explain the high COVID-19 related fatality risk observed in Mexico, despite its younger age structure: the high selectivity and self-selectivity in testing and the high prevalence of chronic-degenerative diseases.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.20074591; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.20074591v1?rss=1";25/4/2020;Coronavirus;0.9983
1671;Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Covid-19 pandemic: a global socioeconomic analysis;10.1101/2020.08.11.20173179;Socioeconomic achievement of WASH (access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene) services are being acknowledged as anticipatory actors, indispensable in safeguarding health during this Covid19 pandemic. However, on a global scale, it is currently not clear whether deprivation or non obtainability of which of the various WASH services are closely related to Covid19 dynamics and up to which degree. We have analyzed data (March to June 2020) related to five Covid19 indicators for most of the countries in the world with indicators of safe water, sanitation and hygiene to understand this. We have found a strong positive correlation between lesser effects of Covid19 and better access to safe water, sanitation as well as hygiene throughout this time for most of the indicators. However, some indicators show the opposite nature of the relationship, for which we have given probable explanation accordingly. The hypothesis of an inversely proportional association between Covid-19 and poor WASH facilities on a global scale is confirmed in this study. We propose that this study should be perceived as an expanded comprehensive view on the complexities of WASH and Covid19 interrelationships, which could help to shape an agenda for research into some unanswered questions.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.20173179; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.11.20173179v1?rss=1";14/8/2020;access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene;0.9837

Well defined URIs help the data to be interoperable and linkable. This paper examines the possibilities of utilizing Wikidata as the means of a vocabulary resource for promoting the use of linkable concepts. Digital curation projects are vibrant with varying demands and purposes, which makes them less suitable for adopting any common vocabularies or ontologies. Also, developing and maintaining custom vocabularies are expensive processes for smaller projects in terms of resources and skill requirements. In general, Wikidata entities are well documented with Wikipedia entries, and Wikipedia entries express the conceptual and hierarchical relations in detail with provisions to modify or create. The authors explain the concept of using Wikidata as a vocabulary source with a proof of concept module implementation for Omeka-S, a widely adapted open source digital curation platform. This paper is expected to show some practical insights on reliable an reasonable vocabulary development for social informatics as well as cultural heritage projects, with a notion to improve the quality and quantity of linkable data from digital curation projects.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971809/;22/2/2021;Linked Open Data;0.9476

1674;The role of mesenchymal stem cells in COVID-19 treatment.;10.5578/tt.69770;The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created a sense of global panic and the medical community started to search for rapid answers. Pharmaceuticals and research labs across the world are racing to find vaccines and treatments for the new coronavirus, using a variety of different technological ways. With Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is observed that asymptomatic symptoms turn out to be severe and fatal. By raising pyrexia, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure are observed to develop which are not only associated with coronavirus. The treatment of the virus and the systemic inflammatory response it causes are also very important. The rapid response to infection has been well defined and comprises a complex interaction of cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and pathologic coagulation. Since the effective therapies are missing and immunological treatments may be deficient, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), by reason of their potent immunomodulatory ability, can have useful results in order to prevent the cytokine storm and reduce morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. The aim of this article is to discuss the potential effect of MSCs types in COVID-19 infection without definite treatment.;"https://doi.org/10.5578/tt.69770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448740/";1/12/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9938
1675;Rapid sequence induction: where did the consensus go?;10.1186/s13049-021-00883-5;BACKGROUND: Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) was introduced to minimise the risk of aspiration of gastric contents during emergency tracheal intubation. It consisted of induction with the use of thiopentone and suxamethonium with the application of cricoid pressure. This narrative review describes how traditional RSI has been modified in the UK and elsewhere, aiming to deliver safe and effective emergency anaesthesia outside the operating room environment. Most of the key aspects of traditional RSI – training, technique, drugs and equipment have been challenged and often significantly changed since the procedure was first described. Alterations have been made to improve the safety and quality of the intervention while retaining the principles of rapidly securing a definitive airway and avoiding gastric aspiration. RSI is no longer achieved by an anaesthetist alone and can be delivered safely in a variety of settings, including in the pre-hospital environment. CONCLUSION: The conduct of RSI in current emergency practice is far removed from the original descriptions of the procedure. Despite this, the principles – rapid delivery of a definitive airway and avoiding aspiration, are still highly relevant and the indications for RSI remain relatively unchanged.;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13049-021-00883-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33985541/";13/5/2021;Rapid Sequence Induction;0.9487
1676;Burnout and Depression in Portuguese Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic—The Mediating Role of Psychological Resilience;10.3390/ijerph18020636;During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCW) have been exposed to multiple psychosocial stressors. Resilience might protect employees from the negative consequences of chronic stress. The aim of this study was to explore the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between depression and burnout (personal, work-related, and client-related). A cross-sectional study was performed using an online questionnaire distributed via social networks. A survey was conducted comprising standardized measures of resilience (Resilience Scale-25 items), depression (subscale of Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 items), and burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory Scale-19 items). A total of 2008 subjects completed the survey, and a hierarchical regression model was estimated for each burnout dimension. The results revealed that depression had not only a directed effect on personal, work- and client-related burnout, but also an indirect small effect on it through resilience. Psychological resilience played a partial mediating role between depression and all burnout dimensions. This partial mediation suggests that there may be other possible variables (e.g., social connection, self-compassion, gratitude, sense of purpose) that further explain the associations.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33451083/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020636";13/1/2021;healthcare workers;0.9384

Many of these studies find an antibody prevalence comparable to the false positive rate of their respective serology tests and the relatively low statistical power associated with each study has invited criticism. To determine the strength of the signal, we perform a meta-analysis on the publicly available seroprevalence data based on Bayesian hierarchical modelling with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling with prediction sampling. We examine studies with results from Santa Clara County (CA), Los Angeles County (CA), San Miguel County (CO), Chelsea (MA), the comte de Geneve (Switzerland), and Gangelt (Germany). Our results are in broad agreement with the conclusions of the studies; we find that there is evidence for non-trivial levels of antibody prevalence across all study locations.

We are failing on all fronts. We spend more money on healthcare per capita than our Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) peers, and our outcomes are mediocre at best. Medicine is not personal, health care professionals often have their hands tied by payers, and geography has too much influence on the quality of care available. This has to end, especially since we have the technology to create a truly patient-focused, whole-person approach - one that treats physical and mental health equally and meets people where they are in every sense. Telemedicine can level the playing field and enable higher-quality, decentralized care that - when needed - brings specialty care to the masses. Other technologies have an important role, too.

1684;Impact of Thiol-Disulfide Balance on the Binding of Covid-19 Spike Protein with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 Receptor;10.1101/2020.05.07.083147;The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which started in 2019. This is a member of Coronaviridae family in the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. In particular, the interaction of viral spike proteins with ACE2 is a critical step in the viral replication cycle. The receptor binding domain of the viral spike proteins and ACE2 have several cysteine residues. In this study, the role of thiol-disulfide balance on the interactions between SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2 was investigated using molecular dynamic simulations. The study revealed that the binding affinity was significantly impaired when all the disulfide bonds of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins were reduced to thiol groups. The impact on the binding affinity was less severe when the disulfide bridges of only one of the binding partners were reduced to thiols. This computational finding provides a molecular basis for the severity of COVID-19 infection due to the oxidative stress.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.083147;11/5/2020;coronavirus disease;0.99
1685;SE-OnionNet: A Convolution Neural Network for Protein–Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction;10.3389/fgene.2020.607824;Deep learning methods, which can predict the binding affinity of a drug–target protein interaction, reduce the time and cost of drug discovery. In this study, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network called SE-OnionNet, with two squeeze-and-excitation (SE) modules, to computationally predict the binding affinity of a protein–ligand complex. The OnionNet is used to extract a feature map from the three-dimensional structure of a protein–drug molecular complex. The SE module is added to the second and third convolutional layers to improve the non-linear expression of the network to improve model performance. Three different optimizers, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, were also used to improve the performance of the model. A majority of protein–molecule complexes were used for training, and the comparative assessment of scoring functions (CASF-2016) was used as the benchmark. Experimental results show that our model performs better than OnionNet, Pafnucy, and AutoDock Vina. Finally, we chose the macrophage migration inhibitor factor (PDB ID: 6cbg) to test the stability and robustness of the model. We found that the prediction results were not affected by the docking position, and thus, our model is of acceptable robustness.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7962986/;19/2/2021;stochastic gradient descent;0.975
1686;Resources for Families during COVID-19: A Content Analysis of Information Provided on School District Web Sites;10.1093/cs/cdab001;The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted the educational system not only in regard to teaching and learning, but also in relation to the other services and supports (mental health services, meal and nutrition programs, and so on) provided to students and families. School district Web sites are critical access points for families during this crisis to learn information about key resources being provided during school closure. This study used content analysis to examine whether school district Web sites in one southeastern state provided information about COVID-19 and 11 other resources. Findings indicate that about half of the Web sites provided both COVID-19 information and additional resources. Few districts provided information on resources for students with disabilities, a subgroup of students at heightened vulnerability during this time of virtual learning. Approximately a third of school district Web sites provided no information on COVID-19 or any of the other resources. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for school social workers related to crisis response and leadership around contributing to efforts that aim to address educational disparities and inequities and maximize student success during this time of crisis.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083192/;21/4/2021;coronavirus;0.9623
1687;Influenza-induced thrombocytopenia is dependent on the subtype and sialoglycan receptor and increases with virus pathogenicity.;10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001640;Thrombocytopenia is a common complication of influenza virus infection, and its severity predicts the clinical outcome of critically ill patients. The underlying cause(s) remain incompletely understood. In this study, in patients with an influenza A/H1N1 virus infection, viral load and platelet count correlated inversely during the acute infection phase. We confirmed this finding in a ferret model of influenza virus infection. In these animals, platelet count decreased with the degree of virus pathogenicity varying from 0% in animals infected with the influenza A/H3N2 virus, to 22% in those with the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus, up to 62% in animals with a highly pathogenic A/H5N1 virus infection. This thrombocytopenia is associated with virus-containing platelets that circulate in the blood. Uptake of influenza virus particles by platelets requires binding to sialoglycans and results in the removal of sialic acids by the virus neuraminidase, a trigger for hepatic clearance of platelets. We propose the clearance of influenza virus by platelets as a paradigm. These insights clarify the pathophysiology of influenza virus infection and show how severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, may propagate thrombocytopenia and/or thromboembolic complications.;"https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609845/";14/7/2020;19;0.9595

World Health Organization (WHO) has already declared it as a pandemic for the whole world, with nearly six million positive cases. Highly contagious nature of the virus has challenged the medical facilities of all the developed and developing country health system. Early identification of the infection is very important to provide medical facilities and cease the chain of infection to new persons. The symptoms such as fever, dry cough, breathing issues generally show in patients not before 5-7 days. However, the patients feel the loss of smell or taste (anosmia) as early as second day onwards due to the presence of virus in nose and throat. Low-cost techniques such as SniffIn-sticks ® Smell Test and UPSIT etc. can be used to test anosmia along with medically approved olfactory test leading to identification of COVID-19 infections. With leading researchers findings anosmia test will be effective in breaking the chain infection of COVID-19 virus. In the exit ports, anosmia test kits may be added to thermal testing to identify the infected patients with low symptoms.

1692;Early-Life Exposure to Environmental Air Pollution and Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Review of Available Evidence;10.3390/ijerph18031204;The number of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has rapidly increased globally. Genetic and environmental factors both contribute to the development of ASD. Several studies showed linkage between prenatal, early postnatal air pollution exposure and the risk of developing ASD. We reviewed the available literature concerning the relationship between early-life exposure to air pollutants and ASD onset in childhood. We searched on Medline and Scopus for cohort or case-control studies published in English from 1977 to 2020. A total of 20 articles were selected for the review. We found a strong association between maternal exposure to particulate matter (PM) during pregnancy or in the first years of the children’s life and the risk of the ASD. This association was found to be stronger with PM(2.5) and less evident with the other pollutants. Current evidence suggest that pregnancy is the period in which exposure to environmental pollutants seems to be most impactful concerning the onset of ASD in children. Air pollution should be considered among the emerging risk factors for ASD. Further epidemiological and toxicological studies should address molecular pathways involved in the development of ASD and determine specific cause–effect associations.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572907/";29/1/2021;Autism Spectrum Disorder;0.969

Unfortunately, the infection numbers and deaths are still increasing rapidly which has put the world on the catastrophic abyss edge. Application of artificial intelligence and spatiotemporal distribution techniques can play a key role to infection forecasting in national and province levels in many countries. As methodology, the presented study employs long short-term memory-based deep for time series forecasting, the confirmed cases in both national and province levels, in Iran. The data were collected from February 19, to March 22, 2020 in provincial level and from February 19, to May 13, 2020 in national level by nationally recognised sources.

Dietary flaxseed has demonstrated a protective effect against an MI. The present study was carried out to test the hypothesis that dietary flaxseed supplementation before and after an MI regulates the expression of above-mentioned miRNAs to produce its cardioprotective effect. Animals were randomized after inducing MI by coronary artery ligation into: (a) sham MI with normal chow, (b) MI with normal chow, and (c-e) MI supplemented with either 10% milled flaxseed, or 4.4% flax oil enriched in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or 0.44% flax lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside. The feeding protocol consisted of 2 weeks before and 8 weeks after the surgery. Dietary flax oil supplementation selectively upregulated the cardiac expression of miR-133a, miR-135a, and miR-29b. The levels of collagen I expression were reduced in the flax oil group. We conclude that miR-133a, miR-135a, and miR-29b are sensitive to dietary flax oil, likely due to its rich ALA content.

Herein, using ligand- and protein-observed fragment screening approaches, we identified niacin and hit 1 binding to the catalytic pocket of the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), thereby modestly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of Mpro. Chemical shift perturbations induced by niacin and hit 1 indicate a partial overlap of their binding sites, i.e., the catalytic pocket of Mpro may accommodate derivatives with large molecular sizes. Therefore, we searched for drugs containing niacin or hit 1 pharmacophores and identified carmofur, bendamustine, triclabendazole, and emedastine; these drugs are highly capable of inhibiting protease activity.

We conducted a systematic review, in which we searched ten databases from April 1990 to August 2020 for original articles in Japan regarding CBME involving citizens and descriptively analyzed them. The Kirkpatrick model was used to categorize the outcomes. Our search for studies following the protocol returned 1240 results; 21 articles were included in this systematic review. Medical trainees reported satisfaction with the content, teaching processes, and teachers’ qualities. Medical trainees’ attitudes toward community and rural medicine improved; they were motivated to become family physicians and work in communities and remote areas. This review clarified that citizen involvement in CBME had an effective impact on medical trainees, positively affecting perceptions of this type of education, as well as improving trainees’ knowledge about and attitude toward community and rural medicine.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33562329/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041575";7/2/2021;Community-based medical education;0.9611
1706;Do Daily Compensatory Health Beliefs Predict Intention to Quit and Smoking Behavior? A Daily Diary Study during Smoking Cessation.;10.3390/ijerph17176419;Compensatory health beliefs (CHBs) are a means to cope with motivational conflicts between intended health goals and the temptation for an unhealthy behavior. As CHBs can fluctuate on a daily basis, this study examined how daily CHBs are associated with daily intention to quit smoking and daily number of cigarettes smoked before and after a quit date at the between- and within-person level. The study comprised a prospective longitudinal design and investigated 83 women and 83 men for 32 consecutive days during an ongoing joint self-set quit attempt. Daily CHBs varied from day to day and between individuals. At the between-person level, higher women's mean CHBs were associated with lower intention (b = -0.23, p = 0.04) and at the 10% level with more cigarettes smoked after the quit date (rate ratio (RR) = 1.92, p = 0.07). At the within-person level, women's higher than usual CHBs were unrelated to intention to quit, but were related to less smoking before (RR = 0.96, p = 0.03) and at the 10% level after the quit date (RR = 0.91, p = 0.09). A marginally positive association between daily CHBs and smoking at the within-person level emerged for men. The negative effect of daily CHBs at the between-person level on smoking seems to unfold after the quit attempt and for women only.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899272/";3/9/2020;Compensatory health beliefs;0.9239
1707;Calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate is associated with reduced case fatality rate of COVID-19 patients with hypertension;10.1101/2020.04.08.20047134;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now spread to more than 100 countries posing as a serious threat to the public health on a global scale. Patients with comorbidity such as hypertension suffer more severe infection with elevated case fatality rate. Development of effective anti-viral drug is in urgent need to treat COVID-19 patients. Here we report that calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a type of anti-hypertension drugs that are widely used in the clinics, can significantly inhibit the post-entry replication events of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Comparison with two other major types of anti-hypertension drugs, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), showed that only CCBs display significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Combined treatment with chloroquine and CCBs significantly enhanced the anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Retrospective clinical investigation of COVID-19 patients revealed that the CCB amlodipine besylate administration distinctly reduced the case fatality rate of patients with hypertension. Results from this study suggest that CCB administration for COVID-19 patients with hypertension as the comorbidity might improve the disease outcome.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.08.20047134v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20047134";14/4/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9653
1708;Knowledge, Awareness, and Practices Regarding the Novel Coronavirus Among a Sample of a Pakistani Population: A Cross-Sectional Study;10.1017/dmp.2020.408;"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding the new coronavirus in a sample of the general Pakistani population. METHODS: This survey was carried out through The University of Faisalabad (TUF), Pakistan, between February 2020 and April 2020. The questionnaire was circulated on various online platforms to gather information. The data were analyzed on SPSS-22. RESULTS: Out of 2121 respondents (13.7% were male, and 86.3% were females), 7.4% were married, 4.5% had a high income, and 5.8% had fewer family members. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) knowledge scores were significantly low in the < 21 years age group as compared to the 21 to 25 years age group (P < 0.001) and > 25 years age group (P < 0.001). The males, married community, high income people, and few family members groups had significantly higher coronavirus knowledge than their respective groups (P = 0.033; P = 0.001; P < 0.001; P = 0.042, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the knowledge score among our study population was not up to the mark.

1709;Sex Differences in Respiratory Infection;10.1007/978-3-030-63549-7_13;"Respiratory infections are an important and frequent cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Sex and gender-based differences in lung infection are recognized and gradually gaining importance due to the potential for gender-tailored therapeutics. While sex and gender differences are widely acknowledged in the evaluation of chronic respiratory disease states such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF), acute and chronic respiratory infection complicate all of these and, in themselves, depending on age and organism, demonstrate sex differences. Males are disadvantaged in the occurrence and severity of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, while females suffer more commonly with upper respiratory tract ailments including tonsillitis and sinusitis. Differences in genetics and immunity have been forwarded as explanations for such differences; however, it is likely that a complex interplay of sex steroid hormones, host immunity, genetics, anatomical variation, and lung physiology, in addition to sociocultural and behavioral factors, influences the observed sex differences in respiratory infection. This chapter aims to assess the current state of the literature in this field and expound the range of its contributory factors.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972079/;19/3/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9828
1710;Systematic Application of Rapid Sequence Intubation With Remifentanil During COVID-19 Pandemic.;10.1177/1089253220941369;In this letter, the authors wonder about the need to apply some of the precautions that have been repeatedly suggested during the recent COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic not only to suspected or documented cases of infection but also to all the new cases entering the hospital. In this regard, orotracheal intubation has been universally recognized as a maneuver with a high risk of viral transmission. On the other hand, rapid sequence induction, which represents the gold standard for limiting the risk of transmission for health care professionals, implies side effects that can be potentially harmful for patients with impaired hemodynamics. In this regard, the authors report a particular type of rapid induction that they are performing in a systematic way during the recent pandemic in cardiac surgery patients. This is performed after the patient reaches a deep analgesic plan, thanks to the unique characteristics of the opioid remifentanil. This type of induction, already tested in vasculopathic patients who underwent carotid surgery, is characterized by great hemodynamic stability and is very advantageous, in the writer's experience, when rapid sequence induction has to be systematically applied to cardiovascular patients, especially if you only want to protect operators.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/1089253220941369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32664787/";15/7/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9295
1711;Strategies to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections: A Narrative Overview;10.2147/rmhp.s269315;Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are a major source of morbidity and mortality and are the second most prevalent cause of death. Furthermore, it has been reported that for every one-hundred patients admitted to hospital, seven patients in high-income economies and ten in emerging and low-income economies acquire at least one type of HCAI. Currently, almost all pathogenic microorganisms have developed antimicrobial resistance, and few new antimicrobials are being developed and brought to market. The literature search for this narrative review was performed by searching bibliographic databases (including Google Scholar and PubMed) using the search terms: “Strategies,” “Prevention,” and “Healthcare-Associated Infections,” followed by snowballing references cited by critical articles. We found that although hand hygiene is a centuries-old concept, it is still the primary strategy used around the world to prevent HCAIs. It forms one of a bundle of approaches used to clean and maintain a safe hospital environment and to stop the transmission of contagious and infectious microorganisms, including multidrug-resistant microbes. Finally, antibiotic stewardship also has a crucial role in reducing the impact of HCAIs through conserving currently available antimicrobials.;"https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s269315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33061710/";28/9/2020;Healthcare-associated infections;0.9259

A cross-country comparative study.;10.1080/09638237.2021.1875413;BACKGROUND The COVID-19 outbreak raised questions about how people experience their mental health, quality of life (QoL), wellbeing and loneliness in the context of social distancing, and the use of social media during this time. AIMS To examine the experience of mental health, QoL, wellbeing and loneliness and use of social media among people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia. METHODS A cross-country comparative survey of people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia. Relevant statistical analyses were used to examine differences between the countries and to explore associations between demographic, mental health and psychosocial variables and use of social media. RESULTS There were 3810 respondents from four countries, of which 50 - 74% showed a high level of emotional distress. The Norwegian population reported significantly better mental health, QoL and wellbeing and lower levels of loneliness compared to the other countries. High-frequent use of social media after the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with poorer mental- and psychosocial health.

Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) was first discovered in the 1970s and is now considered a principal pathogen implicated in the disease complex. Outbreaks occur annually and re-infections are common even in the presence of maternal antibodies. Difficulties have arisen from using both live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines and recent efforts have focused on the development of sub-unit vaccines that are suitable for use in neonatal calves with maternally-derived circulating antibodies. This study was undertaken to identify antigenic epitopes on two of the surface glycoproteins of BRSV, the fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins, the major surface viral antigens, for inclusion into a novel subunit peptide vaccine. Sequencing and antigenicity prediction of the F and G genes of BRSV revealed 21 areas of potential antigenicity; of which genuine peptide/antisera binding occurred with 4 peptides. Identification of the antigenic components of a vaccine is an important first step in the development of novel BRSV vaccines and this data, therefore, provides the basis for the generation of such vaccines.";https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.25.449873;25/6/2021;bovine respiratory disease;0.9284
1714;Evaluation of Minimum Unit Pricing of Alcohol: A Mixed Method Natural Experiment in Scotland;10.3390/ijerph17103394;In May 2018, Scotland became the first country in the world to implement minimum unit pricing (MUP) for all alcoholic drinks sold in licensed premises in Scotland. The use of a Sunset Clause in the MUP legislation was a factor in successfully resisting legal challenges by indicating that the final decision on a novel policy would depend on its impact. An overarching evaluation has been designed and the results will provide important evidence to inform the parliamentary vote on the future of MUP in Scotland. The evaluation uses a mixed methods portfolio of in-house, commissioned, and separately funded studies to assess the impact of MUP across multiple intended and unintended outcomes related to compliance, the alcoholic drinks industry, consumption, and health and social harms. Quantitative studies to measure impact use a suitable control where feasible. Qualitative studies assess impact and provide an understanding of the lived experience and mechanism of change for key sub-groups. As well as providing important evidence to inform the parliamentary vote, adding to the international evidence on impact and experience of alcohol pricing policy across a broad range of outcomes, this approach to evaluating novel policy interventions may provide guidance for future policy innovations.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17103394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414068/";13/5/2020;minimum unit pricing;0.9293
1715;Regime shifts in the COVID-19 case fatality rate dynamics: A Markov-switching autoregressive model analysis;10.1016/j.csfx.2021.100059;The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly to many countries around the world from Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province since December 2019. It has now a huge effect on the global economy. As of 13 September 2020, more than 28, 802, 775, and 920, 931 people are infected and dead, respectively. The mortality of COVID-19 infections is increasing as the number of infections increase. Many countries published control measures to contain its spread. Even though there are many drugs and vaccines under trial by pharmaceutical companies and research groups, no specific vaccine or drug has yet been found. Therefore, it is necessary to explain the behaviour of the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 using the most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data before 13 September 2020. The dynamics in the CFR were analyzed using the Markov-switching autoregressive (MSAR) models. Results showed that the two-regime and three-regime MSAR approach better captured the non-linear dynamics in the CFR time series data for each of the top heavily infected countries including the world. The results also showed that rises in CFRs are more volatile than drops. We believe that this information can be useful for the government to establish appropriate policies in a timely manner.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S259005442100004X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259005442100004X?v=s5";11/5/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9111

The most vital points in selecting the best therapeutic approach for patients with pancreatic tumors during this pandemic are (1) Oncologists need to tailor the treatment plan based on the COVID-19 phase, tumor malignant potential, and patients’ comorbidities; and (2) Optimal treatment for pancreatic cancer should be planned according to the condition of each patient and tumor resectability based on national comprehensive cancer network resectability criteria. To choose the best therapeutic approach for patients with pancreatic tumors during this pandemic, we need to tailor the treatment plan based on elective surgery acuity scale (ESAS).

1717;Shook Ones: Understanding the Intersection of Nonfatal Violent Firearm Injury, Incarceration, and Traumatic Stress Among Young Black Men;10.1177/1557988320982181;Violent injury is a leading cause of death and disability among young Black men, with the highest rates occurring in low-income urban populations. Hospital-based violence intervention programs (HVIPs) offer a promising opportunity to address the biopsychosocial factors that adversely affect this population. However, there are major gaps between the needs of young Black male survivors of violent injury and the forms of care provided by HVIPs. Patient-centered outcomes research provides a useful mode of inquiry to develop strategies to decrease these differences. Care for survivors, including treatment for traumatic stress disorders, must be reconceptualized to center the lived experiences of young Black men. This paper qualitatively explores how these survivors of gun violence express symptoms of traumatic stress and the ways in which their narratives can inform the implementation of the biopsychosocial model in HVIPs. A phenomenological variant ecological systems theory framework was used to analyze participant narratives to aid in understanding their symptoms of traumatic stress and post-injury affective changes as both psychologically and socially important experiences. Such insight may inform changes to HVIP practice to address persistent health disparities related to violence.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356779/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1557988320982181";24/12/2020;Hospital-based violence intervention programs;0.9233

We assess the effectiveness of the sets of non-pharmaceutical interventions that were in place during the course of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in Germany. Our results are based on hybrid models, combining SIR-type models on local scales with spatial resolution. In order to account for the age-dependence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we include realistic prepandemic and recently recorded contact patterns between age groups. The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions will occur on changed contact patterns, improved isolation, or reduced infectiousness when, e.g., wearing masks. In order to account for spatial heterogeneity, we use a graph approach and we include high-quality information on commuting activities combined with traveling information from social networks. The remaining uncertainty will be accounted for by a large number of randomized simulation runs.

Epigenetic reprogramming in EGFR-activated GBM has recently been suggested to downregulate the expression of tumour suppressor genes. Histone acetylation is important for chromatin structure and function. However, the role and biological function of H2AZK4/7AC in tumours have not yet been clarified. RESULTS: In our study, we found that EGFR-vIII negatively regulated H2AZK4/7AC expression though the PI3K/AKT-HDAC2 axis. Because HDAC1 and HDAC2 are highly homologous enzymes that usually form multi-protein complexes for transcriptional regulation and epigenetic landscaping, we simultaneously knocked out HDAC1 and HDAC2 and found that H2AZK4/7AC and H3K27AC were upregulated, which partially released EGFR-vIII-mediated inhibition of USP11, negative regulator of cell cycle. In addition, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that FK228 induced G1/S transition arrest in GBM with EGFR-vIII mutation. FK228 could enhance anti-tumour activity by upregulating expression of the tumour suppressor USP11 in GBM cells. CONCLUSIONS: EGFR-vIII mutation downregulates H2AZK4/7AC and H3K27AC, inhibiting USP11 expression though the PI3K/AKT-HDAC1/2 axis. FK228 is an effective and promising treatment for GBM with EGFR-vIII mutation.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987283/;28/1/2020;regulator of cell cycle;0.9872

This study examined the impact of health education on healthcare-seeking behavior of migrant workers in China and explored the differences in different health education methods. This paper used the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) to analyze the relationship between health education and healthcare-seeking behavior. Our results indicated that health education could significantly improve the healthcare-seeking behavior of migrant workers, but there was still ample space for improvement. From the perspective of different health education methods, lectures, public consultation, and online education were positively correlated to healthcare-seeking behavior, while publicity materials and bulletin boards were not. Although the effects of publicity materials and bulletins were limited, these two health education methods were still the most widely used. Our results emphasized the necessity of increasing investment in lectures, public consultation, online education, and other similar health education methods. This change in health education methods can play an effective role in the spread of health education to improve the healthcare-seeking behavior of migrant workers.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235675/";30/3/2020;China Migrants Dynamic Survey;0.9676

In this study, we present one of the first concerted attempts to measure the types and degree of harm experienced by people displaying signs of problem gaming. Attempts were made to assess the extent to which types of harm were attributable to gaming as opposed to other factors. The study also investigated potential behavioural indicators of harmful involvement, including exposure to loot boxes. A sample of 471 regular gamers (M = 380, F = 73), recruited through the online platform Prolific, completed a survey where problem gaming was identified using Petry et al.’s (2014) checklist. Individuals who met the cut-off for gaming disorder scored higher than the non-problem group on most dimensions of harm, with physical and psychological types being the most common issues. Loot box expenditure was low (M = $25 in 3 months, for the 10.8% of respondents who played loot boxes) but significantly positively associated with the degree of gaming-related financial harm. This study shows that problem gaming is most strongly associated with physical or psychological harm and that financial harms may manifest in gaming activities that facilitate continuous spending options.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121958/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00556-5";7/6/2021;gaming disorder;0.9961
1722;CBSI as a Social Innovation to Promote the Health of Older People in Japan;10.3390/ijerph18094970;In this paper, we introduce a concept called community-based social innovation (CBSI). CBSI programs have been introduced to improve the physical and psychological well-being of older people. CBSI programs encourage older people to (1) take care of themselves and their peers, (2) sustain their well-being, and (3) create a cohesive and inclusive community. Although the emergence of CBSI programs is a global phenomenon, the variations, effectiveness, and sustainability of these programs are unknown. To uncover information about the Japanese version of CBSI programs, we conducted observations and face-to-face interviews with related personnel at two CBSI programs in rural areas of Japan in 2018. We found both positive and negative aspects in the current form of CBSI programs. As for the positives, these programs promote older people’s physical and psychological well-being and enhance community cohesiveness. However, CBSI programs face challenges, including that groups tend to be gender and age specific: men and the younger-old are less likely to show interest. A group-specific approach to CBSI programs could cause future community division, which would be contrary to the goal. Given the continued advancement of the aging population, a new approach to participant recruitment is needed.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067044/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094970";7/5/2021;community-based social innovation;0.9482

While efforts to contain the virus are vital to protect global health, these same efforts are exposing children and adolescents to an increased risk of family violence. Various criminological theories explain the causes of this new danger. The social isolation required by the measures taken in the different countries, the impact on jobs, the economic instability, high levels of tension and fear of the virus, and new forms of relationships have all increased levels of stress in the most vulnerable families and, therefore, the risk of violence. In addition, mandatory lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the disease have trapped children in their homes, isolating them from the people and the resources that could help them. In general, the restrictive measures imposed in many countries have not been accompanied by an analysis of the access to the resources needed to reduce this risk. It is necessary to take urgent measures to intervene in these high-risk contexts so that children and adolescents can develop and prosper in a society which is likely to undergo profound changes, but in which the defense of their rights and protection must remain a major priority.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33088340/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-020-00347-1";20/10/2020;Coronavirus;0.9787

Field-effect transistors based on semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials (2D-FETs) have been identified as potential candidates for rapid and label-free sensing applications. This is because any perturbation of such atomically thin 2D channels can significantly impact their electronic transport properties. Here, we report the use of FET based on semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) WSe2 as a promising biosensor for the rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The sensor is created by functionalizing the WSe2 monolayers with a monoclonal antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and exhibits a detection limit of down to 25 fg/μL in 0.01X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies, including density functional theory, atomic force microscopy, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies, and electronic transport properties, were performed to characterize and explain the device performance. The results demonstrate that TMDC-based 2D-FETs can potentially serve as sensitive and selective biosensors for the rapid detection of infectious diseases.;"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c01188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34181385/";28/6/2021;coronavirus;0.9486

This article reviews the neuroimaging manifestations of COVID-19 on CT and MRI, presenting cases from the New York City metropolitan region encountered by the authors during the first surge of the pandemic. The most common neuroimaging manifestations are acute infarcts with large clot burden and intracranial hemorrhage, including microhemorrhages. However, a wide range of additional imaging patterns occur, including leukoencephalopathy, global hypoxic injury, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum, olfactory bulb involvement, cranial nerve enhancement, and Guillain Barré syndrome. The described central nervous system abnormalities largely represent secondary involvement from immune activation that leads to a prothrombotic state and cytokine storm; evidence for direct neuroinvasion is scant.

1726;Efficacy of a Student-Led Community Contact Tracing Program Partnered with an Academic Medical Center during the COVID-19 Pandemic.;10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.10.004;PURPOSE: Contact tracing has proven successful at controlling COVID-19 globally and the Center for Health Security has recommended that the United States add 100,000 contact tracers to the current workforce. METHODS: To address gaps in local contact tracing, health professional students partnered with their academic institution to conduct contact tracing for all COVID-19 cases diagnosed on site, which included identifying and reaching their contacts, educating participants and providing social resources to support effective quarantine and isolation. RESULTS: From March 24(th) to May 28(th), 536 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were contacted and reported an average of 2.6 contacts. Contacts were informed of their exposure, asked to quarantine and monitored for the onset of symptoms. Callers reached 94% of cases and 84% of contacts. 74% of cases reported at least 1 contact. Household members had higher rates of reporting symptoms (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.19:2.28). The average test turnaround time decreased from 21.8 days for the first patients of this program to 2.3 days on the eleventh week. CONCLUSIONS: This provides evidence for the untapped potential of community contact tracing to respond to regional needs, confront barriers to effective quarantine and mitigate the spread of COVID-19.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S104727972030394X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104727972030394X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775279/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.10.004";22/10/2020;Contact tracing;0.96

A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies that have developed and validated BIA equations in this age group. MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched for relevant literature published up until June 30, 2020, using terms related to bioelectrical impedance, body composition, and paediatrics. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, resulting in 15 studies that had developed and/or validated equations. Forty-six equations were developed and 34 validations were conducted. Most equations were developed in young infants (≤6 months), whereas only seven were developed among older infants and children (6-24 months). Most studies were identified as having a high risk of bias, and only a few included predominantly healthy children born at term. Using the best available evidence, BIA appears to predict body composition at least as well as other body composition tools; however, among younger infants BIA may provide little benefit over anthropometry-based prediction equations. Currently, none of the available equations can be recommended for use in research or in clinical practice.";"https://doi.org/10.1111/cob.12441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33565254/";9/2/2021;Bioelectrical impedance analysis;0.956
1728;Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Professional Roles and Responsibilities of Health Educators.;10.1177/1524839920968523;Public health professionals are at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic response. However, the roles and responsibilities of health educators in pandemic response are unknown. Researchers examined multiple factors that described how health educators' work priorities and lives have been affected by COVID-19. An electronic questionnaire was administered nationally to health educators to assess the effect of the pandemic on their professional responsibilities, the challenges they are facing, and their fears about the future. Of the 913 respondents, 487 (43%) reported changing work priorities, with 80% of that group (389) sharing that their work priorities shifted focus to COVID-19. Most felt qualified to take on the new job responsibilities, but many feared the inability to get back to previous work roles or for their organizations to financially withstand the pandemic. Regardless of workplace setting or job priorities, health educators are prepared in the skills outlined in the Responsibilities and Competencies for Health Education Specialists, which may have led to their abilities in shifting roles so quickly and effectively. Findings from this study may prepare public health agencies to better use and train health educators for their roles in rapidly shifting public health priorities.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839920968523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33135485/";2/11/2020;Public health professionals;0.9085

Tuberculosis (TB) continues to affect millions of people every year with high mortality. There is limited literature on the occurrence of COVID 19 in patients with TB. We reviewed the available data on various clinical details, management, and outcome among patients with COVID-19 and TB. 8 studies reported a total of 80 patients with this coinfection. These patients were reported from 9 different countries, with Italy reporting the largest number of cases. Migrant, males constituted a major proportion of cases. Most reported patients were symptomatic. Fever, dry cough, and dyspnea were the most commonly reported symptoms. Bilateral ground glass opacities were more common in COVID 19 infection and cavitary lesions were more common in patients with TB. Most reported TB patients had been found to have mycobacterium tuberculosis from sputum culture in the background of pulmonary TB. Most patients of TB were treated with multidrug regimen antitubercular therapy. In all 8 studies, COVID 19 was treated as per the local protocol. Mortality was reported in more than 10% of patients. Mortality was higher in elderly patients (> 70 years) and amongst patient with multiple medical comorbidities.

South America is among the last regions hit by COVID-19 pandemic. In Uruguay, first cases were detected on March 13 th 2020 presumably imported by travelers returning from Europe. Methods We performed whole-genome sequencing of 10 SARS-CoV-2 from patients diagnosed during the first week (March 16th to 19th) of COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay. Then, we applied genomic epidemiology using a global dataset to reconstruct the local spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Results Our phylogeographic analysis showed three independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from different continents. Also, we evidenced regional circulation of viral strains originally detected in Spain. Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay could date back as early as Feb 20th. Identification of specific mutations showed rapid local genetic differentiation. Conclusions We evidenced early independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 that likely occurred before first cases were detected. Our analysis set the bases for future genomic epidemiology studies to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay and the Latin America and the Caribbean region.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.086223;10/5/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9519

1732;A nursing informatics response to COVID‐19: perspectives from five regions of the world;10.1111/jan.14417;The 21st century has seen several infectious disease outbreaks that have turned into epidemics and pandemics including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which began in Asia in 2003 (Poon, Guan, Nicholls, Yuen, & Peiris, 2004), followed by H1N1 that emerged in Mexico and the United States in 2009 (Belongia et al., 2010). Next came the lesser known Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) originating in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (Assiri et al., 2013), after which the Ebola outbreak in West Africa took place from 2014 to 2016, with a more recent occurrence in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 2018 to 2019 (Malvy, McElroy, de Clerck, Günther, & van Griensven, 2019). To date, the coronavirus (COVID‐19) outbreak that started in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, in late December 2019 seems to be eclipsing all of these previous infectious diseases in terms of its global reach and impact (Wang, Horby, Hayden, & Gao, 2020). After being declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency on 30 January 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020c), it was elevated to a pandemic status on 11 March 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020d).

1733;Decision-Making in Future Industrial Systems: Is Ethics a New Performance Indicator?;10.1007/978-3-030-69373-2_16;This study deals with ethical aspects of decision-making in the context of future industrial systems such as depicted by the Industry 4.0 principles. These systems involve a great number of interacting elements, with more or less autonomy. In this sense, ethics may become an important mean to ensure a long-term viable joint integration of humans and artificial elements in future industrial systems merged into the society. Two complementary views can be thus identified to integrate ethics in such future industrial systems. The first view conventionally defines ethics as a non-negotiable static set of conditions and rules to be met by the considered systems throughout their lifecycle. The second view assumes that ethics can be seen as a performance factor to which a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is associated and which can, therefore, be more or less directly measured and lead to improvement through time. Starting from an overall definition of the concept of ethics, its conventional vision and its specifications regarding future industrial systems, these two views are exposed and discussed, leading to the establishment of some properties for the definition of a generic framework to handle ethics throughout decision-making processes. Concluding remarks and prospects are finally presented.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980841/;1/2/2021;Key Performance Indicator;0.9362

The consequence of that has been a heightened level of anxiety among humans and opting for unorthodox consumption behaviors as consumers. In this study the attempt was to analyze human behaviors during the ongoing pandemic process from the perspective of psychology and marketing fields of science. In so doing, interrelation among anxiety, which surfaced because of Covid-19 pandemic, coping style with stress of individuals and compulsive purchase behavior has been explored. Based on these interrelations, a structural model was suggested. Findings of the research indicated that anxiety has high effect on the helpless approach dimension, which is one of the coping styles with stress; and that helpless approach alone has an effect on compulsive buying behavior. Besides, another objective of the study was to evaluate the mediating effect of intolerance of uncertainty between coping style with stress and compulsive buying behavior.

We start with search engines, showing how organisations can identify popular food safety and nutrition queries, facilitating the creation of timely and in-demand content. To ensure this content is discoverable by search engines, we cover several non-technical aspects of search engine optimisation (SEO). We next explore the potential of games, apps, social media, and going viral for reaching and engaging the public, and how digital data-based tools can be used to optimise communications. Throughout, we draw on examples not only from Europe and North America, but also China. While we are enthusiastic about the benefits of digital communications, we recognise that they are not without their drawbacks and challenges. To help organisations evaluate whether a given digital approach is appropriate for their objectives, we end each section with a discussion of limitations. We conclude with a discussion of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the practical, philosophical, and policy challenges associated with communicating food safety and nutrition information digitally.;"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-020-00074-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083546/";1/10/2020;search engines;0.9692

However, an alarming number of novel variants termed Variants of Concern (VoC) were found to harbor mutations that diminished the neutralizing capacity of antibodies elicited by the vaccines. We have investigated the neutralizing titers of antibodies from sera of humans and rats immunized with the MVC-COV1901 vaccine against pseudoviruses coated with the wildtype, D614G, B.1.1.7, or B.1.351 spike proteins. Rats vaccinated with two doses of adjuvanted S-2P retained neutralization activities against the B.1.351 variant, albeit with a slight reduction compared to wildtype. Phase 1 vaccinated subjects showed more reduced neutralization abilities against the B.1.351 variant. The study is among the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate dose-dependent neutralizing responses against VoCs, particularly against B.1.351, from different doses of antigen in a clinical trial for a subunit protein COVID-19 vaccine. The appearance of vaccine escape variants is a growing concern facing many current COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Strategies should be adopted against the ever-changing nature of these variants. The observations of this study grant us valuable insight into preemptive strikes against current and future variants.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21254000v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.21254000";22/3/2021;Vaccination;0.9188

Social work educators and practitioners in both the countries have proactively engaged in international short-term faculty and student exchanges and field placements, research activities and collaborative initiatives such as workshops, international conferences and joint publishing of social work texts. The authors, from Bharathidasan University (BDU) and James Cook University (JCU), noted the success of these original endeavors and particularly their potential to create momentum beyond the initial activity. They saw that focusing on collaborative social work learning in their own smaller contexts could create positive change and impact in ways they did not anticipate. This experience, replicated in other collaborative activities, provided enormous insights and learning on both sides, leading finally to the idea of documenting cross-cultural perspectives from India and Australia.

1739;Effectiveness modelling of digital contact-tracing solutions for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic;10.1017/s0373463321000175;Since the beginning of the coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, digital contact-tracing applications (apps) have been at the centre of attention as a digital tool to enable citizens to monitor their social distancing, which appears to be one of the leading practices for mitigating the spread of airborne infectious diseases. Many countries have been working towards developing suitable digital contact-tracing apps to allow the measurement of the physical distance between citizens and to alert them when contact with an infected individual has occurred. However, the adoption of digital contact-tracing apps has faced several challenges so far, including interoperability between mobile devices and users’ privacy concerns. There is a need to reach a trade-off between the achievable technical performance of new technology, false-positive rates, and social and behavioural factors. This paper reviews a wide range of factors and classifies them into three categories of technical, epidemiological and social ones, and incorporates these into a compact mathematical model. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of digital contact-tracing apps based on received signal strength measurements. The results highlight the limitations, potential and challenges of the adoption of digital contact-tracing apps.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060546/;7/4/2021;coronavirus;0.987

As public health officials seek to contain the virus and mitigate the deleterious effects on worldwide population health, a related threat has emerged: global media exposure to the crisis. We review research suggesting that repeated media exposure to community crisis can lead to increased anxiety, heightened stress responses that can lead to downstream effects on health, and misplaced health-protective and help-seeking behaviors that can overburden health care facilities and tax available resources. We draw from work on previous public health crises (i.e., Ebola and H1N1 outbreaks) and other collective trauma (e.g., terrorist attacks) where media coverage of events had unintended consequences for those at relatively low risk for direct exposure, leading to potentially severe public health repercussions. We conclude with recommendations for individuals, researchers, and public health officials with respect to receiving and providing effective communications during a public health crisis.

However, it is rare in the pediatric population with familial aggregation. CASE PRESENTATION A 3-year-old boy presented with pain and irritation on the oral mucosa while contacting spicy food for 2 months. Oral examination showed widespread whitish reticular and papular lesions on the lips, the dorsum of the tongue, and bilateral buccal mucosa, with diffuse erosions covered with pseudomembrane on the buccal mucosa. The boy's parents were examined to exhibit white reticular and plaque-like lesions on their oral mucosa. The three patients were clinically diagnosed as affected by OLP and histopathologically confirmed. The boy underwent topical treatment with recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (rb-bFGF) gel, and oral lesions gradually resolved and healed. Neither of his parents received treatment. During the subsequent follow-ups, none of three patients underwent any medical treatment. Fortunately, their lesions had almost faded over 8 years. CONCLUSIONS Our case emphasizes that pediatric OLP should be recorded with family history. Besides, long-term periodic follow-up is recommended in pediatric patients with OLP for monitoring any changes in lesions.;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-020-01333-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243193/";26/11/2020;Oral lichen planus;0.9036
1746;The Role of Heart Rate Variability in the Future of Remote Digital Biomarkers;10.3389/fnins.2020.582145;Heart rate variability (HRV) offers insights into humoral, neural and neurovisceral processes in health and disorders of brain, body and behavior but has yet to be fully potentiated in the digital age. Remote measurement technologies (RMTs), such as, smartphones, wearable sensors or home-based devices, can passively capture HRV as a nested parameter of neurovisceral integration and health during everyday life, providing insights across different contexts, such as activities of daily living, therapeutic interventions and behavioral tasks, to compliment ongoing clinical care. Many RMTs measure HRV, even consumer wearables and smartphones, which can be deployed as wearable sensors or digital cameras using photoplethysmography. RMTs that measure HRV provide the opportunity to identify digital biomarkers indicative of changes in health or disease status in disorders where neurovisceral processes are compromised. RMT-based HRV therefore has potential as an adjunct digital biomarker in neurovisceral digital phenotyping that can add continuously updated, objective and relevant data to existing clinical methodologies, aiding the evolution of current “diagnose and treat” care models to a more proactive and holistic approach that pairs established markers with advances in remote digital technology.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33281545/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2020.582145";13/11/2020;Heart rate variability;0.9461
1747;COVID‐19 in elderly kidney transplant recipients;10.1111/ajt.16096;The SARS‐Cov‐2 infection disease (COVID‐19) pandemic has posed at risk the kidney transplant (KT) population, particularly the elderly recipients. From March‐12(th) until April‐4(th) 2020, we diagnosed COVID‐19 in 16 of our 324 KT patients aged ≥65 years old (4.9%). Many of them had had contact with healthcare facilities in the month prior to infection. Median time of symptom onset to admission was 7 days. All presented with fever and all but one with pneumonia. Up to 33% showed renal graft dysfunction. At infection diagnosis, mTOR inhibitors or mycophenolate were withdrawn. Tacrolimus was withdrawn in 70%. The main treatment combination was hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. A subset of patients was treated with anti‐retroviral and tocilizumab. Short‐term fatality rate was 50% at a median time since admission of 3 days. Those who died were more frequently obese, frail and had underlying heart disease. Although a higher respiratory rate was observed at admission in nonsurvivors, symptoms at presentation were similar between both groups. Patients who died were more anemic, lymphopenic and showed higher D‐dimer, C‐reactive protein, and IL‐6 at their first tests. COVID‐19 is frequent among the elderly KT population and associates a very early and high mortality rate.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32471001/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16096";29/5/2020;SARS‐Cov‐2 infection disease;0.9003
1748;Droplet-Transmitted Infection Risk Ranking Based on Close Proximity Interaction;10.3389/fnbot.2019.00113;We propose an automatic method to identify people who are potentially-infected by droplet-transmitted diseases. This high-risk group of infection was previously identified by conducting large-scale visits/interviews, or manually screening among tons of recorded surveillance videos. Both are time-intensive and most likely to delay the control of communicable diseases like influenza. In this paper, we address this challenge by solving a multi-tasking problem from the captured surveillance videos. This multi-tasking framework aims to model the principle of Close Proximity Interaction and thus infer the infection risk of individuals. The complete workflow includes three essential sub-tasks: (1) person re-identification (REID), to identify the diagnosed patient and infected individuals across different cameras, (2) depth estimation, to provide a spatial knowledge of the captured environment, (3) pose estimation, to evaluate the distance between the diagnosed and potentially-infected subjects. Our method significantly reduces the time and labor costs. We demonstrate the advantages of high accuracy and efficiency of our method. Our method is expected to be effective in accelerating the process of identifying the potentially infected group and ultimately contribute to the well-being of public health.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6985151/;21/1/2020;person re-identification;0.9888
1749;Travel restrictions as a disease control measure: Lessons from yellow fever.;10.1080/17441692.2020.1805786;Travel restrictions have become a common disease control measure during the 2019 Coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19). Measures have ranged from quarantines when entering a country to outright travel bans. Yet more widespread travel restrictions in the form of country vaccine entry requirements have been in place for a long time for another disease - yellow fever. We track the historical underpinnings and policy developments that have led to stringent vaccine entry requirements today. We also discuss the political issues raised by health measures imposed on borders and discuss the reasons behind some clear regional differences. Almost no European countries currently have vaccine entry requirements, while at the other end of the spectrum, the majority of countries in the African region do, making vaccine entry requirements a global south phenomenon. We argue that vaccine entry requirements should be reassessed in the future as an underused public health tool, likely to become increasingly common. Vaccine entry requirements have proved effective in controlling the international spread of yellow fever but more can be done to ensure better use of this measure. Caution is needed due to the close links between public health and politics, evident since the first travel restriction in quarantines.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1805786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32772788/";10/8/2020;Coronavirus disease pandemic;0.977

There are no effective and curative treatments, but supportive care only. Cell therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for refractory and unmanageable pulmonary illnesses, as proved by accumulating preclinical studies. Stem cells consist of totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, and unipotent cells with the potential to differentiate into cell types requested for repair. Mesenchymal stromal cells, endothelial progenitor cells, peripheral blood stem cells, and lung progenitor cells have been applied to clinical trials. To date, the safety and feasibility of stem cell and extracellular vesicles administration have been confirmed by numerous phase I/II trials in patients with COPD, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchial dysplasia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary artery hypertension, and silicosis. Five routes and a series of doses have been tested for tolerance and advantages of different regimes. In this review, we systematically summarize the global trends for the cell therapy of common airway and lung diseases registered for clinical trials. The future directions for both new clinical trials and preclinical studies are discussed.;"https://doi.org/10.4252/wjsc.v12.i6.471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742564/";26/6/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9871
1751;Case Report: Opportunities for Treatment of Severe COVID-19 Patients—Lessons From a Death Case;10.3389/fmed.2020.00533;With the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increases each day. To date, there is no specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug. The usual approach to treating COVID-19 is treating its symptoms. However, this approach is limited by the different conditions of each area. We treated a 57-year-old man who was initially diagnosed with a severe type of the infection, but he progressed to a critical condition and eventually died. We learned valuable lessons from this case. The first lesson is the need to use immediate invasive mechanical ventilation if there is no obvious improvement after using non-invasive ventilation for several hours, which directly affects the prognosis. Another lesson is the risk involved in transferring severe COVID-19 patients. In the process of transfer, various threats may be encountered at any time. Thus, accurate assessment of the patient's condition and strict medical conditions are highly required. During the patient's 25-day treatment, we performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation twice. Currently, many patients require invasive mechanical ventilation and transfer to a superior hospital. We hope our findings will provide some advice and help for treating severe and critical COVID-19 cases.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923450/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00533";14/8/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9462

There is little information about effects of COVID-19 on Pregnant women and newborns as a sensitive population. The current study is a systemic review and Meta-analysis to measure the risks and determine the presentations of COVID-19 in pregnant women and newborn. Methods: online data bases were searched on march 20. Heterogeneity of the included studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and Higgins I2 statistic and expressed as percentage. All data were analyzed with 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 7 studies involving 50 participants with Positive test of COVID-19 were enrolled. Mean age of pregnant women was 30.57 years old and the Mean Gestational age was 36.9 weeks. Other variables such as Apgar score, birth weight, Sign and symptoms, Complications and Laboratory data were Analyzed. Conclusion: Our findings showed same clinical characteristics in pregnant women as in non-pregnant adults, with the main symptoms being cough and fever. No vertical transmission was seen and all patients delivered healthy neonates. Our findings would be of great help to the decision making process, regarding the management of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053983;7/4/2020;Novel coronavirus disease;0.9571

Family physicians (FPs) have played a critical role in the coordination of care. MATERIALS AND METHODS In April 2020, we performed an online prospective survey to assess the impact of the pandemic on FPs' practices. RESULTS Three hundred FPs were included. Mean age was 53.6 ± 13.5 years. Before the pandemic, 60.2% reported >75 outpatient visits/week, which reduced down to an average of <20/week for 79.8% of FPs; 24.2% of FPs discontinued home visits, while for 94.7% of FPs there was a >50% increase in the number of telephone consultations. Concern related to the risk of contagion was elevated (≥3/5 in 74.6%) and even higher to the risk of infecting relatives and patients (≥3/5 in 93.3%). The majority of FPs (87%) supported the role of telemedicine in the near future. Satisfaction regarding the network with hospitals/COVID-19-dedicated wards received a score ≤2/5 in 46.9% of cases. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the working practices of FPs.

1754;Published Anti-SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro Hits Share Common Mechanisms of Action that Synergize with Antivirals;10.1101/2021.03.04.433931;The global efforts in the past few months have led to the discovery of around 200 drug repurposing candidates for COVID-19. Although most of them only exhibited moderate anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, gaining more insights into their mechanisms of action could facilitate a better understanding of infection and the development of therapeutics. Leveraging large-scale drug-induced gene expression profiles, we found 36% of the active compounds regulate genes related to cholesterol homeostasis and microtubule cytoskeleton organization. The expression change upon drug treatment was further experimentally confirmed in human lung primary small airway. Following bioinformatics analysis on COVID-19 patient data revealed that these genes are associated with COVID-19 patient severity. The expression level of these genes also has predicted power on anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy in vitro, which led to the discovery of monensin as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-E6 cells. The final survey of recent drug-combination data indicated that drugs co-targeting cholesterol homeostasis and microtubule cytoskeleton organization processes more likely present a synergistic effect with antivirals. Therefore, potential therapeutics should be centered around combinations of targeting these processes and viral proteins.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.04.433931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688643/";4/3/2021;drug repurposing candidates;0.9098
1755;Camostat Mesylate against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 - Rationale, Dosing and Safety.;10.1111/bcpt.13533;The coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, utilizes a viral membrane spike protein for host cell entry. For the virus to engage in host-membrane-fusion, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the human transmembrane surface protease, TMPRSS2, to cleave and activate the spike protein. Camostat mesylate, an orally available well-known serine protease inhibitor, is a potent inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and has been hypothesized as a potential antiviral drug against COVID-19. In vitro human cell and animal studies have shown that camostat mesylate inhibits virus-cell membrane fusion and hence viral replication. In mice, camostat mesylate treatment during acute infection with influenza, also dependent on TMPRSS2, leads to a reduced viral load. The decreased viral load may be associated with an improved patient outcome. Because camostat mesylate is administered as an oral drug, it may be used in outpatients as well as inpatients at all disease stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection if it is shown to be an effective antiviral agent. Clinical trials are currently ongoing to test whether this well-known drug could be repurposed and utilized to combat the current pandemic. In the following, we will review current knowledge on camostat mesylate mode of action, potential benefits as an antiviral agent, and ongoing clinical trials.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33176395/";11/11/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9494
1756;Giant recurrent left inguinal hernia with femoral nerve injury: a report of a rare case;10.1186/s12893-020-00786-9;BACKGROUND: Giant inguinal hernia(GIH), a rare disease, has brought great challenges to surgeons. GIH is defined as an inguinal hernia that extends below the midpoint of the inner thigh in standing position. However, a giant recurrent inguinal hernia resulting from previous operations that destroy the anatomical structure of the inguinal region is extremely rare. Nerve injury, a complication following inguinal hernia repair, is mostly found in ilioinguinal nerve and iliohypogastric nerve, which often presents as numbness and acute or chronic pain, while postoperative muscular dysfunction results from femoral nerve injury is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-years-old woman presented with a complaint of a reducible mass in the left inguinal of duration 1 year. The patient had three previous inguinal hernia repairs. Physical examination and auxiliary examination indicated a giant inguinal hernia with femoral nerve injury. After preoperative evaluation and preparation, a transabdominal partial extraperitoneal(TAPE) repair have performed. Finally, the patient recovered and was discharged. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we reported a rare case of a giant recurrent inguinal hernia with femoral nerve injury and made a successful treatment for the patient via transabdominal partial extraperitoneal(TAPE) repair.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32517752/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-020-00786-9";9/6/2020;Giant inguinal hernia;0.9041
1757;Design and Computational Evaluation of a Pediatric MagLev Rotary Blood Pump.;10.1097/mat.0000000000001323;Pediatric heart failure (HF) patients have been a historically underserved population for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) therapy. To address this clinical need, we are developing a low cost, universal magnetically levitated extracorporeal system with interchangeable pump heads for pediatric support. Two impeller and pump designs (pump V1 and V2) for the pediatric pump were developed using dimensional analysis techniques and classic pump theory based on defined performance criteria (generated flow, pressure, and impeller diameter). The designs were virtually constructed using computer-aided design (CAD) software and 3D flow and pressure features were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. Simulated pump designs (V1, V2) were operated at higher rotational speeds (~5,000 revolutions per minute [RPM]) than initially estimated (4,255 RPM) to achieve the desired operational point (3.5 L/min flow at 150 mm Hg). Pump V2 outperformed V1 by generating approximately 30% higher pressures at all simulated rotational speeds and at 5% lower priming volume. Simulated hydrodynamic performance (achieved flow and pressure, hydraulic efficiency) of our pediatric pump design, featuring reduced impeller size and priming volume, compares favorably to current commercially available MCS devices.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315663/";9/12/2020;computer-aided design;0.9463
1758;Allosteric inhibition of the SARS‐CoV‐2 main protease – insights from mass spectrometry‐based assays;10.1002/anie.202010316;Following translation of the SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA genome into two viral polypeptides, the main protease M pro cleaves at eleven sites to release non‐structural proteins required for viral replication. M Pro is an attractive target for antiviral therapies to combat the coronavirus‐2019 disease (COVID‐19). Here, we have used native mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the functional unit of M pro . Analysis of the monomer‐dimer equilibria reveals a dissociation constant of K d = 0.14 ± 0.03 µM, revealing M Pro has a strong preference to dimerize in solution. Developing an MS‐based kinetic assay we then characterized substrate turnover rates by following temporal changes in the enzyme‐substrate complexes, which are effectively “flash‐frozen” as they transition from solution to the gas phase. We screened small molecules, that bind distant from the active site, for their ability to modulate activity. These compounds, including one proposed to disrupt the catalytically active dimer, slow the rate of substrate processing by ~35%. This information was readily obtained and, together with analysis of the x‐ray crystal structures of these enzyme‐small molecule complexes, provides a starting point for the development of more potent molecules that allosterically regulate M Pro activity.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202010316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32841477/";25/8/2020;coronavirus‐2019 disease;0.9381
1759;Can Ontologies Support the Gamification of Scripted Collaborative Learning Sessions?;10.1007/978-3-030-52237-7_7;In the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), scripts orchestrate the collaborative learning (CL) process to achieve meaningful interactions among the students and so improve the learning outcomes. Nevertheless, the use of scripts may cause motivational problems over time. To deal with this issue, we propose the gamification of scripted CL sessions through an ontology that encodes knowledge from game design practices and theories of motivation and human behavior. This knowledge may be used by intelligent theory-aware systems to avoid the one-size-fits-all approach, providing support for the personalization of gamification. In this paper, we reported the results obtained in an empirical study to validate our ontology-based gamification of scripted CL sessions. Findings from this study indicate that intrinsic motivation, perceived choice, and effort/importance of students were significantly better when our ontology was used to support the gamification. The learning outcomes were significantly better in scripted CL sessions gamified through our approach, with positive correlations to the intrinsic motivation and perceived choice. Based on these results, we can state that the use of ontologies provides adequate support to carry out well-thought-out gamification of scripted sessions.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334152/;9/6/2020;Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning;0.9824
1760;693 Are Virtual Clinics the New ‘Normal’? – A Single-Institution Comparative Analysis of Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness of Virtual and Face-To-Face Clinics;10.1093/bjs/znab135.037;INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound impact on clinicians, hospital resources and patients. Urology Virtual clinics (VCs) were initiated at our institution to ensure continued provision of service during the pandemic. The study aim was to analyse outcomes and cost-effectiveness of VCs compared to pre-COVID-19 face-to face (F2F) clinics. METHOD: We retrospectively analysed the VCs from 18(th) March 2020 to 1st July 2020 and compared them to F2F clinics in the same period in 2019. Clinical outcomes were compared, and potential financial savings were estimated to see if VCs can be incorporated into future practice. RESULTS: 1317 patients were reviewed in 2020 as compared to 1941 in 2019. We noted similar rates of discharges [25.4% (2020) v/s 24.1% (2019)], follow-ups (48.7% (2020) v/s 48.4% (2019)] and patients who did not attend/answer (6.8% (2020) v/s 6.6% (2019)]. Potentially, over £100,000 can be saved by changing 50% appointments to VCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that VCs are non-inferior to F2F clinics and have allowed continued effective service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is potential to incorporate VCs into future practice without compromising on efficacy. Further data collection and analysis is ongoing at our institution on a larger scale.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135973/;4/5/2021;coronavirus;0.9525
1761;Endothelial Dysfunction and Its Clinical Implications.;10.1177/0003319720987752;Endothelial dysfunction (ED) plays a substantial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and some other vascular diseases. ED has been demonstrated in patients with hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, and in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Besides classical risk factors, ED is affected by chronic inflammatory diseases and acute infections, particularly viral diseases. Causes of ED include oxidative stress, inflammation, and shear stress, which decrease the bioavailability of nitric oxide. Markers of ED have been sought, particularly circulating markers. Using these tests, it is possible to evaluate the response to harmful effects of risk factors and the effects of treatment on vessel wall function. Endothelial dysfunction is significantly and directly correlated with the occurrence of cardiac events and the risk of cardiac events increase as ED worsens. Because endothelial function plays a central role in atherogenesis it became a therapeutic target. Endothelial dysfunction is reversible and its improvement may be achieved by elimination of risk factors, inhibitors of endothelium-derived contracting factors (angiotensin-converting enzyme), smoking cessation, lipid-lowering drugs, diet, and physical exercise. By reversing ED, it is possible to restore vascular function.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003319720987752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504167/";28/1/2021;Endothelial dysfunction;0.979
1762;Evidence for CAT gene being functionally involved in the susceptibility of COVID-19.;10.1096/fj.202100008;Novel coronary pneumonia (COVID-19) is a respiratory distress syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus. Understanding the genetic basis of susceptibility and prognosis to COVID-19 is of great significance to disease prevention, molecular typing, prognosis, and treatment. However, so far, there have been only two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on the susceptibility of COVID-19. Starting with these reported DNA variants, we found the genes regulated by these variants through cis-eQTL and cis-meQTL acting. We further did a series of bioinformatics analysis on these potential risk genes. The analysis shows that the genetic variants on EHF regulate the expression of its neighbor CAT gene via cis-eQTL. There was significant evidence that CAT and the SARS-CoV-2-related S protein binding protein ACE2 interact with each other. Intracellular localization results showed that CAT and ACE2 proteins both exists in the cell membrane and extracellular area and their interaction could have an impact on the cell invasion ability of S protein. In addition, the expression of these three genes showed a significant positive correlation in the lungs. Based on these results, we propose that CAT plays a crucial intermediary role in binding effectiveness of ACE2, thereby affecting the susceptibility to COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33710662/";1/4/2021;Novel coronary pneumonia;0.9888
1763;Visual Field Artifacts in Glaucoma With Face Mask Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic.;10.1097/ijg.0000000000001706;PURPOSE The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has changed how outpatient care is delivered in ophthalmology clinics, particularly with glaucoma care. This case series highlights the need for awareness of fogging and improper face mask fit as causes of standard automated perimetry artifacts in patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma. CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS Six patients with the diagnosis of ocular hypertension, glaucoma suspect, or glaucoma underwent standard automated perimetry (24-2 or 10-2 SITA, Humphrey Field Analyzer) while wearing ear-loop surgical face masks. Due to patient complaints of fogging during the testing, low test reliability, and unexpected results, the tests were repeated after taping securely the mask to the bridge of the nose. CLINICAL FINDINGS Fogging may reduce visual field (VF) test reliability and induce artifacts that mimic glaucomatous defects. VF test reliability can be improved and artifacts minimized following mask taping. In 1 case there was worsening of VF defects after mask taping. This suggests that fogging may also disguise true VF defects. CONCLUSIONS Fogging can result in unreliable VF testing with glaucoma-like artifacts. Secure taping of the face mask to the nose bridge may minimize this problem and reduce unnecessary additional testing and follow-up visits.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116056/";27/10/2020;coronavirus;0.9834
1764;Susceptibility of obese population to COVID-19;10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.015;Obesity is a risk factor for disease severity in individuals with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, the increased susceptibility of this population to COVID-19 is unclear. We outline several underlying mechanisms that may explain the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity. Obesity has an adverse effect on respiratory physiology because increased intra-abdominal adipose tissue can interfere with lung expansion, resulting in a reduced lung compliance. Further, fat accumulation in the soft tissue of the pharynx can increase inspiratory resistance. Also, obesity may be associated with sleep apnea. Obesity is associated with several defects in cell-mediated immunity including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Impaired adipocyte-mediated immune function results in chronically high leptin levels and low adiponectin levels and anti-inflammatory adipokines. Reduced physical activity can impair several steps of the immune response to viruses. Obesity also promotes a hypercoagulable state, leading to serious consequences. These factors may synergistically play a role in promoting the severity of the disease in obese individuals. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which obesity contributes to the severity of COVID-19 is important for developing more effective treatments.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220322189?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33045426/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220322189";9/10/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9119

We aimed to analyze the data daily transmitted by the Home Monitoring (HM) system (BIOTRONIK, Berlin, Germany) of CIEDs during the infection. METHODS: We identified CIED patients followed with the HM who experienced COVID‐19 clinical manifestations. The daily trends of the following HM variables were analyzed: mean heart rate (HR), physical activity, thoracic impedance (TI), ventricular and atrial arrhythmic burden. RESULTS: The study cohort included 10 CIED patients (median age 90 [84‐92] years, male 90%) with acute respiratory syndrome. The HR showed an increase of a value ranging from 10 to 30 bpm well in advance of the severe clinical manifestations. The physical activity was generally low during the entire infection course. The TI decreased in patients presented with pulmonary edema, but increased significantly (8 to 25 Ω) in most COVID‐19 patients (8 out of 10) suggesting an association with pulmonary fibrosis. Arrhythmic complications were also found in half of the patients. CONCLUSION: The trends of HR and TI in CIEDs recipients infected by the COVID‐19 often showed early recurrent patterns before adverse clinical manifestations.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/joa3.12483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33664909/";18/12/2020;Cardiac implantable electronic device;0.9497

Two hundred and four caregivers took part in the study, completing a self-reported questionnaire about the person with MCI/dementia and their own, since the lockdown period which started in February and ended in May of 2020 in Greece. Results indicated a significant overall decline of the people with MCI/dementia. Further, the domains in which people with MCI/dementia were mostly affected were: communication, mood, movement, and compliance with the new measures. Caregivers also reported a great increase in their psychological and physical burden during this period, where the available support sources were limited. The pandemic threatens to disrupt the basic routines that promote mental and physical health of both people with MCI/dementia and their caregivers. Further measures to protect and provide support to people who suffer and their families are needed. This article is protected by  .

1767;A multistage combined approach to promote diabetic wound healing in COVID‐19 era;10.1111/iwj.13476;"When diabetes mellitus is not properly controlled with drugs and a healthy lifestyle, it exposes patients with advanced peripheral arterial disease or critical limb ischaemia (CLI) to the most serious complications, in particular lower limb ulcers. Surgical or endovascular treatments represent the first line of intervention; in addition, the adequate management of ulcers can guarantee not only a faster wound healing but also the improvement of the patient's prognosis. To speed up this process, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), platelet‐rich plasma (PRP), and other advanced moist wound dressing have been proposed. During Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, many patients with CLI and diabetes mellitus had difficult access to advanced treatments with a significant reduction in life expectancy. We report the cases of patients with non‐healing ulcers and CLI treated with an empiric multistage approach after successful endovascular revascularisation; the postoperative course was eventful in all patients, and foot ulcers are currently in an advanced state of healing.

1768;Son las alteraciones en mucosa oral un signo de COVID-19? Estudio transversal en un Hospital de Campaña;10.1016/j.ad.2021.02.007;Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has many manifestations, including respiratory, thrombotic, neurologic, digestive, and cutaneous ones. Cutaneous manifestations have been classified into 5 clinical patterns: acro-ischemic (pseudo-chilblain), vesicular, urticarial, maculopapular, and livedoid. Oral manifestations have also been reported, but much less frequently. Patients and Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study in which we examined the oral mucosa of 666 patients with COVID-19 at the IFEMA field hospital in Madrid in April 2020. Results: Seventy-eight patients (11.7%) had changes involving the oral mucosa. The most common were transient anterior U-shaped lingual papillitis (11.5%) accompanied or not by tongue swelling (6.6%), aphthous stomatitis (6.9%), a burning sensation in the mouth (5.3%), mucositis (3.9%), glossitis with patchy depapillation (3.9%), white tongue (1.6%), and enanthema (0.5%). Most of the patients also reported taste disturbances. Conclusions: COVID-19 also manifests in the oral cavity. The most common manifestations are transient U-shaped lingual papillitis, glossitis with patchy depapillation, and burning mouth syndrome. Mucositis with or without aphthous ulcers or enanthema may also be observed. Any these findings may be key clues to a diagnosis of COVID-19.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001731021001071; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ad.2021.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33652010/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001731021001071?v=s5";27/2/2021;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9866
1769;The prospects of sitting 'end of year' open book exams in the light of COVID-19: A medical student's perspective.;10.1080/0142159x.2020.1766668;Medical schools in the UK have been forced to dramatically restructure teaching and assessment amidst the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As part of this, some have opted to assess progression through open book examinations (OBE). I aim to share my thoughts as an unsettled 4th year medical student about to embark on my first set of clinical exams conducted in this format. The difficulties associated with preparing for examinations under such unique and challenging circumstances cannot be underestimated. Working from home, during social distancing, surrounds students with the extra family stresses that we are all facing during this pandemic. This combined with a new, unfamiliar examination format will inevitably lead to students feeling daunted. While some would argue that an OBE may reward good problem solvers, students still require a strong foundation of knowledge. The luxury of reference will not be afforded in all clinical settings thus leading to concerns regarding students skimming over essential learning points. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the increased opportunity for academic misconduct resulting from an open book assessment format. Why are medical schools placing undue stress on students who could instead focus their attention on living compassionately for others during this difficult time?;"https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2020.1766668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32432953/";20/5/2020;Coronavirus;0.9932
1770;Predicting COVID-19 incidence in French hospitals using human contact network analytics;10.1101/2021.06.17.21258666;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, China in 2019 and spread worldwide within few weeks. The COVID-19 epidemic started to gain traction in France in March 2020. Sub-national hospital admissions and deaths were then recorded daily and served as the main policy indicators. Concurrently, mobile phone positioning data have been curated to determine the frequency of users being colocalized within a given distance. Contrarily to individual tracking data, these can provide a proxy of human contact networks between subnational administrative units. Motivated by numerous studies correlating human mobility data and disease incidence, we developed predictive time series models of hospital incidence between July 2020 and April 2021. Adding human contact network analytics such as clustering coefficients, contact network strength, null links or curvature as regressors, we found that predictions can be improved substantially (more than 50%) both at the national and sub-national for up to two weeks. Our sub-national analysis also revealed the importance of spatial structure, as incidence in colocalized administrative units improved predictions. This original application of network analytics from co-localisation data to epidemic spread opens new perspectives for epidemics forecasting and public health.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.21258666v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.17.21258666";23/6/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9938
1771;Contribution of nurses to protective environment in haematopoietic cell transplant setting: an international survey by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation;10.1038/s41409-020-01194-6;Infections are frequently experienced complications for patients undergoing haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). To assess current infection prevention strategies, an international survey among HCT nurses was conducted by the Nurses Group and IDWP of the EBMT. Nurse representatives from all EBMT transplant centres were invited to complete an online questionnaire on protective environment in adult and paediatric HCT units. A total of 141 complete questionnaires were returned for the isolation section and 26 for the paediatric section, the majority of respondents (89.4%) being nurses. A small number of centres (7.1%) reported not allowing visitors, the rest have rules for entering patient rooms. Most HCT units (99.3%) indicated that nurses play a critical role in infection prevention and measures differed between bacterial infections and viral infections. Many of the paediatric units (57.7%) had a play area, applying rules of entry. To our knowledge, this is the first survey on protective environment directed at nurses within HCT centres. Despite having different practices, most HCT units tend to decrease isolation procedures and the use of PPE for multi-drug resistant organisms. This must concur with an increase of hand hygiene compliance, for which our data show that there is still room for improvement.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514921/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41409-020-01194-6";29/1/2021;haematopoietic cell transplant;0.9902

Therefore, it is necessary to find out potential therapeutic pharmaceuticals for this disease. This study investigates the inhibitory effect of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 (3CL(pro)) using pharmaceuticals containing α-ketoamide group and pyridone ring based on molecular docking. Of these, eight pharmaceuticals approved by US-Food and Drug Administration have shown good contact with the catalytic residues of 3CL(pro). They are telaprevir, temsirolimus, pimecrolimus, aminoglutethimide, apixaban, buspirone, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide. Their binding affinity score ranged from -5.6 to -7.4 kcal/mol. Hydrogen bonds were observed and reported. To the knowledge, this study report for the first time a compound that could be binding to ALA(285), the new residue resulting from genetic modification of 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 that has increased its catalytic activity 3.6-fold compared with its predecessor 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV.

1773;The brief comparison of the operational efficiency of pool-testing strategies for COVID-19 mass testing in PCR laboratories;10.1101/2020.07.14.20151415;This paper addresses the operational efficiency of different pool-testing strategies in typical scenarios of a PCR laboratory working in mass testing for COVID-19 with different values of prevalence, limitations and conditions of testing, and priorities of optimization. The research employs a model of the laboratory's testing process, created after interviewing of PCR laboratories and studying their operations. The limitations and operational characteristics of this model were applied in a simulation of the testing process with different pool-testing strategies managed by a computer program developed in the LOMT project. The efficiency indicators assessed are the number of assays needed to obtain results of a batch of specimens, the number of specimens identified after the first analysis, and total time to obtain all results. Depending on prevalence, constraints of testing, and priorities of optimization, different pool-testing strategies provide the best operational efficiency. The binary splitting algorithm provides the maximum reduction of the number of assays: from 1.99x reduction for a high prevalence (10%) to 25x reduction for a low prevalence (0.1%), while other algorithms provide the least amount of time to obtain results or the maximum number of the specimens classified after the first analysis.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151415; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.14.20151415v1?rss=1";20/7/2020;mass testing;0.9088
1774;A case report of acute Leriche syndrome: aortoiliac occlusive disease due to embolization from left ventricular thrombus caused by myocarditis;10.1186/s12872-021-02031-4;BACKGROUND: Leriche syndrome is the triad of symptoms consisting of claudication, erectile dysfunction, and absence of femoral pulses. Inflammatory disease of the heart muscle, myocarditis, may occur because of immune system activation, drug exposure or infections. CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old man with no previous medical history presented to the emergency department with acute back pain that had started suddenly during weightlifting, which was initially misdiagnosed as spinal disc herniation. The patient returned four hours later and a thoracoabdominal computed tomography showed a large thrombus in the aortoiliac region creating a total occlusion. Vascular surgery with embolectomy was immediately performed. Further investigation with echocardiography revealed deteriorated systolic dysfunction with marked hypokinesia and two large thrombi in the left ventricle. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed late contrast enhancement of the inferolateral and septal regions, which indicated a recent myocarditis. CONCLUSION: Myocarditis can result in multiple embolization with diverse organ manifestation including total occlusion of the aortoiliac arteries, which required urgent embolectomy.

Se and Zn are essential trace elements, known to play a crucial role in thyroid homeostasis. However, there is a lack of data reporting thyrotoxicity during gestation. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of selenium and zinc against potassium dichromate-induced thyrotoxicity in pregnant Wistar rats. Thirty pregnant Wistar rats were divided into control and four treated groups receiving subcutaneously (s.c) on the 3rd day of pregnancy, K2Cr2O7 (10 mg/kg, s.c) alone, or in association with Se (0.3 mg/kg, s.c), ZnCl2 (20 mg/kg, s.c), or both of them simultaneously. The hormonal profile, oxidative stress biomarkers, DNA damage, and histological modifications were evaluated. Our main findings showed that K2Cr2O7 promoted hypothyroidism, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and histological alterations in the thyroid gland. The co-treatment with Se or ZnCl2 has mitigated K2Cr2O7-induced thyrotoxicity in pregnant Wistar rats by exhibiting antioxidant and genoprotective effects. However, the combined co-treatment of both of them was less thyroprotective, and therefore, further investigations on the synergetic interaction of Se and Zn against CrVI toxicity using different doses and exposure routes are required.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12268-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423197/";9/1/2021;Hexavalent chromium;0.9225

Six hundred and thirty-three cardiologists in training participated in the survey. Ninety-five percent of the respondents affirmed that the training programme has been somewhat stopped or greatly jeopardized by the pandemic. For 61% of the fellows in training (FITs), the pandemic had a negative effect on their education. Moreover, 59% of the respondents believe that they would not be able to fill the gap gained during that period over the rest of their training. A negative impact on the psycho-physical well being has been reported by 86% of the FITs.

1780;Large-scale identification of T cell epitopes derived from SARS-CoV-2 for the development of peptide vaccines against COVID-19.;10.1093/infdis/jiab324;BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) continues to be a major public health challenge globally. The identification of SARS-CoV-2-derived T cell epitopes is of critical importance for peptide vaccines or diagnostic tools of COVID-19. METHODS In this study, a number of SARS-CoV-2-derived HLA-I binding peptides were predicted by NetMHCpan-4.1 and selected by Popcover to achieve pancoverage of the Chinese population. The top 5 ranked peptides derived from each protein of SARS-CoV-2 were then evaluated using PBMCs from unexposed individuals (negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG). RESULTS Seven epitopes derived from 4 SARS-CoV-2 proteins were identified. Interestingly, most (5 out of 7) of the SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides with predicted affinities for HLA-I molecules were identified as HLA-II-restricted epitopes and induced CD4+ T cell-dependent responses. These results complete missing pieces of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and suggest that pre-existing T cells targeting all SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins can be discovered in unexposed populations. CONCLUSIONS In summary, in the current study, we present an alternative and effective strategy for the identification of T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy subjects, which may indicate an important role in the development of peptide vaccines for COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145459/";18/6/2021;BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease-19;0.9328

The detection of this virus as early as possible will help in contaminating the spread of it as the virus is mutating itself as fast as possible and currently there are about 4,300 strains of the virus according to the reports. Clinical studies have shown that most of the COVID-19 patients suffer from a lung infection similar to influenza. So, it is possible to diagnose lung infection using imaging techniques. Although a chest computed tomography (CT) scan has been shown to be an effective imaging technique for lung-related disease diagnosis, chest X-ray is more widely available across the hospitals due to its considerably lower cost and faster imaging time than CT scan. The advancements in the area of machine learning and pattern recognition has resulted in intelligent systems that analyze CT Scans or X-ray images and classify between pneumonia and normal patients. This paper proposes KE Sieve Neural Network architecture, which helps in the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. This architecture is achieving an accuracy of 98.49%.

We conducted a cross-sectional online survey to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Brazilian HCW. Data were collected between 11 August and 1 November 2020. Of the 295 respondents, 95 (32.2%) were medical doctors, 82 (27.8%) administrative staff, 53 (18.0%) nurses, 27 (9.2%) laboratory staff, and 38 (12.9%) were other staff. COVID-19-related restructuring at the health facilities was reported by 207 (70.2%) respondents, and 69 (23.4%) had their tasks changed. Preventive measures were well respected when seeing suspected patients. Overall, 167 (56.6%) HCW screened positive for anxiety and 137 (46.4%) for depression; 109 (36.9%) screened positive for both conditions. Of the 217 (73.6%) HCW who had been tested for COVID-19, at least one positive result was reported in 49 (22.6%). Following a positive COVID-19 test, 45/49 (91.8%) stopped working and stayed home. In conclusion, we found a high incidence of COVID-19 infection among Brazilian HCW with high rates of anxiety and depression despite a good self-reported adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures.

The causative coronavirus was later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). As of 10 August, 2020, more than 19,718,030 confirmed cases and 728,013 deaths have been reported. COVID-19 is spread via respiratory droplets which are inhaled into the lungs. AREAS COVERED In this article, we summarized the knowledge about the causative pathogen of COVID-19 and various diagnostic methods in this pandemic for better understanding of the limitations and the nuances of virus testing for COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION In this pandemic, a rapid and an accurate identification of COVID-19 patients are critical to break the chain of infection in the community. RT-PCR provides a rapid and reliable identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

1785;Perceived Stress, Stigma, Traumatic Stress Levels and Coping Responses amongst Residents in Training across Multiple Specialties during COVID-19 Pandemic—A Longitudinal Study;10.3390/ijerph17186572;This study aimed to explore changes in psychological responses (perceived stress, traumatic stress, stigma, coping) over time in residents, as well as their predictors. The level of perceived stress, traumatic stress, stigma, and coping responses were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale, Impact of Event-Revised, Healthcare Workers Stigma Scale, and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) Inventory, respectively. We collected responses from 274 residents at baseline and 221 residents at 3 months follow-up (timepoint 2) from the National Healthcare Group (NHG) residency programs in Singapore. All residents reported lower perceived stress and lower perceived stigma compared to baseline. Use of avoidance coping was associated with all three psychological responses (perceived stress, traumatic stress, and stigma) across the two timepoints. Compared to baseline, specific factors associated with perceived stress and traumatic stress at timepoint 2 were living alone, less problem solving, and seeking social support. Residency programs should encourage active coping strategies (e.g., seeking social support, positive thinking, problem solving) among residents, and proactively identify residents who may be at higher risk of psychological sequelae due to circumstances that contribute to isolation.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916996/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186572";9/9/2020;Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced;0.975

This rapid pathogenic virus plays an important role in finding the pathogenic virus, treatment and prevention of pandemics. Virus can present everywhere in Global village. As it is virus it can extend easily and cause severe illness to the society. Hence, an efficient international attentiveness of plan is necessary to the prediction and prevention. In this review, epidemic outbreak, clinical findings, prevention recommendations of COVID-19 and suggestive medicinal value of south Indian plant sources has been discussed. Though the varieties of improved approaches have been taken in scientific and medicinal concern, we have to pay attention on medicinal value of the plant based sources to prevent these types of endemic diseases. This is one of the suggestive and effective ways to control the spreading of viruses. In future its required to provide medicinal plant based clinical products (Masks, sanitizers, soap etc.) with better techniques by clinicians to contend the scarcity and expose towards the nature based medicine rather than chemical drugs.

1787;A Practical Perspective on the Roles of Solution NMR Spectroscopy in Drug Discovery;10.3390/molecules25132974;Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study structures and dynamics of biomolecules under physiological conditions. As there are numerous NMR-derived methods applicable to probe protein–ligand interactions, NMR has been widely utilized in drug discovery, especially in such steps as hit identification and lead optimization. NMR is frequently used to locate ligand-binding sites on a target protein and to determine ligand binding modes. NMR spectroscopy is also a unique tool in fragment-based drug design (FBDD), as it is able to investigate target-ligand interactions with diverse binding affinities. NMR spectroscopy is able to identify fragments that bind weakly to a target, making it valuable for identifying hits targeting undruggable sites. In this review, we summarize the roles of solution NMR spectroscopy in drug discovery. We describe some methods that are used in identifying fragments, understanding the mechanism of action for a ligand, and monitoring the conformational changes of a target induced by ligand binding. A number of studies have proven that (19)F-NMR is very powerful in screening fragments and detecting protein conformational changes. In-cell NMR will also play important roles in drug discovery by elucidating protein-ligand interactions in living cells.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7411973/;28/6/2020;fragment-based drug design;0.9248

In January the disease spread rapidly to other regions and beyond Chinese borders until it reached Italy where, on February 21, the first case of non-imported contagion was found. On the same date, as the commercial activities were still regularly open, the dinner, which saw as protagonists the participants of this retrospective study, took place. Of the 49 people attending the event, 47 joined the study. The participants of this study were all males, with an average age of 57 years old, all asymptomatic during the dinner. The participants voluntarily underwent serological or swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 and answered questions from our telephone interview. From the data obtained it emerges that 26 people (55.3%), after the dinner, developed one or more symptoms. The most frequently encountered symptom was fever, present in 76.9% of the symptomatic. 26 people were positive on the diagnostic tests (55.3% of the total examined), 24 of them were symptomatic. The conceivable R0 (the basic reproduction number) is higher than the one present in the literature (7.7 vs 3.8), this is probably due to the conditions in which the dinner took place (not ventilated environment, absence of safety distances, absence of personal protective equipment).;"https://doi.org/10.1701/3453.34420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078010/";1/10/2020;serological or swab tests;0.9162

The outbreak was first reported in December 2019 from Wuhan, China, but rapidly progressed into a pandemic of an unprecedented scale since the 1918 flu pandemic. In addition to respiratory complications in COVID-19 patients, clinical characterizations of severe infection cases indicated a number of other comorbidities, including multiple organ failure (liver, kidney, and heart) and septic shock. In an attempt to elucidate COVID-19 pathogenesis in different human organs, we interrogated the presence of the virus in the blood, or any of its components, which might provide a form of trafficking or hiding to the virus. By computationally analyzing high-throughput sequence data from patients with active COVID-19 infection, we found evidence of traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), while the virus RNA was abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the same patients. To the best of our knowledge, the presence of SAR-CoV-2 RNA in the PBMC of COVID-19 patients has not been reported before, and this observation could suggest immune presentation, but discounts the possibility of extensive viral infection of lymphocytes or monocytes.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097055; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.10.20097055v1?rss=1";18/5/2020;pathogenesis;0.9228

The results show significantly increased risk estimates for all analyzed systems and for all domains, demonstrating a sincere loss in the effectiveness and efficiency of health and safety prevention. Applying these results to the medical sector leads to the conclusion of an elsewhere empirically demonstrated reduction in patient care and patient safety. It is argued that increasing working and reducing rest times of the available work force is not an effective solution for problems of lacking human resources due to its adverse side effects on employees and third parties.

A 15.9 year old adolescent with severe AN of eight-month duration was treated off-label with metreleptin. Hyperactivity was assessed with accelerometry. Visual analogue scales (VAS), validated self- and clinician rating scales and lab results tracked changes from baseline to end of the 24-day dosing period and a five-month follow-up. Substantial improvements of mood and eating disorder related cognitions and hyperactivity set in after two days of treatment. During dosing, sub-physiological testosterone and TT3 levels normalized; clinically libido reemerged. Weight did not increase substantially during the dosing period. During follow-up target weight was attained; mood did not deteriorate; hyperactivity ceased. The results substantiate the strong effects seen in female cases and underscore the need for a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to confirm the observed strong, multiple and rapid onset beneficial effects of metreleptin in AN.

1793;Considerations on the use of antihypertensive blockers of the renin-angiotensin system in adults and children in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.;10.24875/bmhim.20000158;As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities develop more severe coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 and are at high risk of death, a controversy arose about the use of antihypertensives as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Such drugs might increase the expression of the fundamental receptor of this new infectious agent: the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Preclinical observations indicate that the increase of ACE2 expression or the activity by ACEis and ARBs leads to a greater transformation of angiotensin (Ang)-II to Ang-(1-7), which is associated with positive effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary pathophysiology. This association has been demonstrated in observational studies in patients with cardiovascular pathology and pneumonia. It has not been possible to confirm whether users of ACEis or ARBs are more infected by the new coronavirus, due to methodological issues in studies with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the use of such antihypertensive treatments in both children and adults might reduce the virulence of infection. Therefore, changes in the antihypertensive therapy of patients at risk of contracting COVID-19 are not recommended.;"https://doi.org/10.24875/bmhim.20000158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064690/";1/1/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9591

Despite its generally favorable clinical efficacy, some undesirable outcomes associated with DBS have been reported. Among such complications are incidences of suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB) in patients undergoing this neurosurgical procedure. However, causal associations between DBS and increased suicide risk are not demonstrated and they constitute a debated issue. In light of these observations, the main objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive and unbiased overview of the literature on suicide risk in patients who received subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal part of globus pallidum (GPi) DBS treatment. Additionally, putative mechanisms that might be involved in the development of SI and SB in these patients as well as caveats associated with these hypotheses are introduced. Finally, we briefly propose some clinical implications, including therapeutic strategies addressing these potential disease mechanisms. While a mechanistic connection between DBS and suicidality remains a controversial topic that requires further investigation, it is of critical importance to consider suicide risk as an integral component of candidate selection and post-operative care in DBS.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060445/;8/4/2021;Deep brain stimulation;0.9254

While transplantation provides the greatest improvement in survival and quality of life, the vast majority of patients are treated initially with hemodialysis. However, outcomes differ significantly among patient populations. Barriers in access to care have particularly affected at-risk populations, such as Black and Hispanic patients. These patients receive less pre-ESKD nephrology care, are less likely to initiate dialysis with a fistula, and wait longer for transplants-even in pediatric populations.

1797;Energy Density Comparison via Highspeed, In-situ Imaging of Directed Energy Deposition;10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.101;Abstract Metal additive manufacturing has become an increasingly popular technology and receives interest from multiple business sectors that require optimally lightweight components and mass customization (aerospace, automotive, and medical device). Directed energy deposition (DED) is one of the main laser-based additive manufacturing processes, but a fundamental understanding of the process is lacking partly because it has not been the focus of highspeed, in-situ x-ray imaging studies like laser powder bed fusion has. A novel in-situ DED system is presented here, and an experimental study is performed to show that the small-scale system recovers processing parameter trends of a full-scale build. Observed meltpool lengths range from about 200 μm to 900 μm, while meltpool depths range from about 50 μm to 500 μm and can support high-fidelity modelling. Additionally, an investigation on the relationship between meltpool dimensions and global energy density GED' is performed. It was found that GED' is not a good predictor of meltpool dimensions due to the discrepancy in linear and exponential trends in laser powder and powder mass flowrate. Further studies and analysis using the presented novel DED system are needed to develop an appropriate energy density term to predict of meltpool dimension and clad height.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315535; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315535";31/12/2020;Directed energy deposition;0.9937

To combat this spread, clinical imaging, for example, X-ray images, can be utilized for diagnosis. Automatic identification software tools are essential to facilitate the screening of COVID-19 using X-ray images. This paper aims to classify COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia patients from chest X-ray images. As such, an Optimized Convolutional Neural network (OptCoNet) is proposed in this work for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. The proposed OptCoNet architecture is composed of optimized feature extraction and classification components. The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters for training the CNN layers. The proposed model is tested and compared with different classification strategies utilizing an openly accessible dataset of COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia images. The presented optimized CNN model provides accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score values of 97.78%, 97.75%, 96.25%, 92.88%, and 95.25%, respectively, which are better than those of state-of-the-art models.

1799;The Moderating Effect of Attentional Control on the Relationship Between COVID Stress and Generalized Anxiety Symptoms.;10.1177/00332941211025260;The recent global pandemic (i.e., COVID-19) has had a serious impact on psychological health, as the stress associated with the pandemic increases the likelihood of developing clinically significant anxiety. Evidence suggests that attentional control may protect those individuals with outcome-specific vulnerabilities from developing maladaptive psychological outcomes. In the present study, attentional control was examined as a moderator of the relation between COVID-19 stress and generalized anxiety symptoms in a community sample (N = 359 adults). As predicted, the relationship between COVID-19 stress and anxiety was moderated by attentional control. Specifically, as attentional control decreased, the strength of the association between COVID-19 stress and anxiety increased. The results suggest that, among those with higher levels of COVID-19 stress, attentional control may act as a protective factor against developing anxiety. It may be beneficial as a matter of standard public health guidance to recommend that the general public engages in activities that are known to improve attentional control and alleviate emotional distress (e.g., mindfulness-based techniques) at the outset of a pandemic or other global catastrophe to reduce the likelihood that prolonged event-related stress will lead to impairing anxiety.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941211025260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120535/";12/6/2021;global pandemic;0.9681

Inevitably, professional training and education are affected which include the medical training of medical interns. Methods This is a cross-sectional, pilot study to determine the impact of the pandemic on University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) medical interns. A survey which comprises 37-items was used. Data are analysed by Ordinal Logistic Regression Analysis. Results Medical interns feel that they lack clinical skills (p = 0.005) and need more exposure in surgical operations (p =0.029). Some are satisfied with the introduction of triage (p = 0.024), online teaching (p = 0.005) and bedside teaching (p=0.023). Most of them think they are fit and ready to handle the pandemic (p = 0.012 and 0.025 respectively) except first year medical interns (p = 0.029).

1801;Reliance on emotion promotes belief in fake news;10.1186/s41235-020-00252-3;"What is the role of emotion in susceptibility to believing fake news? Prior work on the psychology of misinformation has focused primarily on the extent to which reason and deliberation hinder versus help the formation of accurate beliefs. Several studies have suggested that people who engage in more reasoning are less likely to fall for fake news. However, the role of reliance on emotion in belief in fake news remains unclear. To shed light on this issue, we explored the relationship between experiencing specific emotions and believing fake news (Study 1; N = 409). We found that across a wide range of specific emotions, heightened emotionality at the outset of the study was predictive of greater belief in fake (but not real) news posts. Then, in Study 2, we measured and manipulated reliance on emotion versus reason across four experiments (total N = 3884). We found both correlational and causal evidence that reliance on emotion increases belief in fake news: self-reported use of emotion was positively associated with belief in fake (but not real) news, and inducing reliance on emotion resulted in greater belief in fake (but not real) news stories compared to a control or to inducing reliance on reason. These results shed light on the unique role that emotional processing may play in susceptibility to fake news.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026546/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-020-00252-3";7/10/2020;emotional processing;0.9864
1802;Opioid Use Disorder: Treatments and Barriers;10.7759/cureus.13173;Over the last decade, opioid use around the world has risen considerably and is projected to continue to rise at an alarming rate. As opioid use rises, so too does the number of people who suffer from opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid overdose-related deaths. As science and medicine progresses, new medications and therapies have arisen in order to help treat patients suffering from addiction. Treatment can be split into two main domains: pharmacological and non-pharmacological. Buprenorphine and methadone, currently the most prescribed medications for patients suffering from OUD, have been shown to be extremely effective in clinical trials but have significant real-world limitations. Geographical disparities between various locations, physician stigma with prescribing these medications, and training required to prescribe medication can make access to these treatments difficult for patients. Non-pharmacological interventions have also been shown to help with limited efficacy when combined with pharmacological interventions. However, the time and resources required to implement these strategies may be a difficult barrier to overcome. In this review, we assess pharmacological interventions, non-pharmacological treatments, examine barriers to treatment for patients, and propose solutions to bypass these barriers.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717718/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13173";6/2/2021;opioid use disorder;0.957

The SAQs were examined on psychometric analysis and Bloom’s cognitive levels for the two educational blocks of 1st medical year (i.e. Musculoskeletal (MSK) and Renal blocks). We found substantial improvement in the discrimination index values of SAQs prepared after the workshop (p = 0.04). A higher number of SAQs with moderate difficulty and higher discrimination were also observed. Flaws within the post-workshop questions were reduced (3.0%) when compared with pre-workshop (12.5%). The major incline was also reported within Bloom’s cognitive levels when pre-workshop K2 questions (30%) were compared with post-workshop (45.5%) with a p-value = 0.05. The SAQs constructed by the faculty member without participating in FDP are generally of unsatisfactory quality. After the FDP the assessment items of two blocks improved for various parameters of student assessment.

Recent clinical trials reported that the use of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors to treat COVID-19 patients could reduce dyspnea and hypoxia, thromboinflammation, hypercoagulability and improve oxygenation. However, the mechanism of action remains unclear. Thus, this study employs structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) to repurpose BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib, dasatinib, evobrutinib, fostamatinib, ibrutinib, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, spebrutinib, XL418 and zanubrutinib against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking is conducted with BTK inhibitors against structural and nonstructural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and host targets (ACE2, TMPRSS2 and BTK). Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are then carried out on the selected complexes with high binding energy. Ibrutinib and zanubrutinib are found to be the most potent of the drugs screened based on the results of computational studies. Results further show that ibrutinib and zanubrutinib could exploit different mechanisms at the viral entry and replication stage and could be repurposed as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22137071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209188/";30/6/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.99

The number of infection as well as death cases are increasing day by day, and outperforming all the records of previously found infectious diseases. This pandemic is imposing specific pressures on the medical system almost the whole globe. The respiration problem is the main complication that a COVID-19 infected patient faced generally. It is a matter of hope that the recent deployment of small-scale technologies like 3D printer, microcontroller, ventilator, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) are mostly used to resolve the problem associated with medical equipment’s for breathing. This paper aims to overview the existing technologies which are frequently used to support the infected patients for respiration. We described the most recent developed breathing aid devices such as oxygen therapy devices, ventilator, and CPAP throughout the review. A comparative analysis among the developed devices with necessary challenges and possible future directions are also outlined for the proper selection of affordable technologies. It is expected that this paper would be of great help to the experts who would like to contribute in this area.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-020-00300-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063053/";19/8/2020;Novel coronavirus;0.957
1807;Household food security and the COVID‐19 pandemic in Nigeria;10.1111/1467-8268.12515;Pivotal to human development and the sustainable development goals is food security, which remains of substantial concern globally and in Nigeria, particularly during the COVID‐19 pandemic despite various palliatives and intervention initiatives launched to improve household welfare. This study examined the food security status of households during the pandemic and investigated its determinants using the COVID‐19 National Longitudinal Phone Survey (COVID‐19 NLPS). In analysing the data, descriptive statistics, bivariate as well as multivariate analysis were employed. Findings from the descriptive statistics showed that only 12% of the households were food secure, 5% were mildly food insecure, 24.5% were moderately food insecure and over half of the households (58.5%) experienced severe food insecurity. The result from the ordered probit regression identified socioeconomic variables (education, income and wealth status) as the main determinants of food security during the pandemic. This study indicates that over two‐thirds of households were threatened by food insecurity in Nigeria. The finding indicates the gross inadequacy of government palliative support and distribution. Thus, regarding policy implication, interventions and palliatives should be well planned and consistent with household size and needs.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149240/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8268.12515";10/3/2021;National Longitudinal Phone Survey;0.9622
1808;Recommendations for Responsible Development and Application of Neurotechnologies;10.1007/s12152-021-09468-6;Advancements in novel neurotechnologies, such as brain computer interfaces (BCI) and neuromodulatory devices such as deep brain stimulators (DBS), will have profound implications for society and human rights. While these technologies are improving the diagnosis and treatment of mental and neurological diseases, they can also alter individual agency and estrange those using neurotechnologies from their sense of self, challenging basic notions of what it means to be human. As an international coalition of interdisciplinary scholars and practitioners, we examine these challenges and make recommendations to mitigate negative consequences that could arise from the unregulated development or application of novel neurotechnologies. We explore potential ethical challenges in four key areas: identity and agency, privacy, bias, and enhancement. To address them, we propose (1) democratic and inclusive summits to establish globally-coordinated ethical and societal guidelines for neurotechnology development and application, (2) new measures, including “Neurorights,” for data privacy, security, and consent to empower neurotechnology users’ control over their data, (3) new methods of identifying and preventing bias, and (4) the adoption of public guidelines for safe and equitable distribution of neurotechnological devices.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12152-021-09468-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942016/";29/4/2021;deep brain stimulators;0.9697
1809;Oral delivery of SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccines using attenuated Salmonella typhimurium as a carrier in rat;10.1101/2020.07.23.217174;The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the disease that has been identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the prophylactic treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation. The effective delivery of eukaryotic expression plasmids to the immune systems inductive cells constitutes an essential requirement for the generation of effective DNA vaccines. Here, we have explored the use of Salmonella typhimurium as vehicles to deliver expression plasmids orally. Attenuated Salmonella phoP harboring eukaryotic expression plasmids that encoded spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was administered orally to Wistar rats. Rats were immunized orally with Salmonella that carried a eukaryotic expression plasmid once a week for three consecutive weeks. The efficiency of the vaccination procedure was due to the transfer of the expression plasmid from the bacterial carrier to the mammalian host. Evidence for such an event could be obtained in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that all immunized animals generated humoral immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, indicating that a Salmonella-based vaccine carrying the Spike gene can elicit SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune responses in rats, and may be useful for the development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.217174;23/7/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9253
1810;Oral inhalation for delivery of proteins and peptides to the lungs.;10.1016/j.ejpb.2021.04.003;Oral inhalation is the preferred route for delivery of small molecules to the lungs, because high tissue levels can be achieved shortly after application. Biologics are mainly administered by intravenous injection but inhalation might be beneficial for the treatment of lung diseases (e.g. asthma). This review discusses biological and pharmaceutical challenges for delivery of biologics and describes promising candidates. Insufficient stability of the proteins during aerosolization and the biological environment of the lung are the main obstacles for pulmonary delivery of biologics. Novel nebulizers will improve delivery by inducing less shear stress and administration as dry powder appears suitable for delivery of biologics. Other promising strategies include pegylation and development of antibody fragments, while carrier-encapsulated systems currently play no major role in pulmonary delivery of biologics for lung disease. While development of various biologics has been halted or has shown little effects, AIR DNase, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, recombinant neuraminidase, and heparin are currently being evaluated in phase III trials. Several biologics are being tested for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, and it is expected that these trials will lead to improvements in pulmonary delivery of biologics.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2021.04.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852968/";11/4/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9911

As of 2007, approximately 98.4% of Taiwanese people were enrolled in the NHIRD. In total, 531,281 records identified as antidepressant prescriptions were collected. Furthermore, 2556 quarterly observations from the Taiwan Housing Index (THI) and Executive Yuan were retrieved. We examined the association between the housing index and antidepressant prescription incidence. During the 10-year follow-up period, a higher incidence of antidepressant prescriptions was associated with the local maximum housing index. The relative risk of being prescribed antidepressant increased by 13.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01~1.27) when the THI reached a peak. For the low-income subgroup, the relative risk of being prescribed antidepressants increased by 28% during the high season of the THI. We also stratified the study sample on the basis of their sex, age, and urbanization levels. Both sexes followed similar patterns. During 2001–2011, although rising economic indexes may have increased incomes and stimulated the housing market, the compromise of public mental health could be a cost people have to pay additional attention to.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33946567/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094839";30/4/2021;National Health Insurance Research Database;0.9781
1812;ORF3a mediated-incomplete autophagy facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication;10.1101/2020.11.12.380709;SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent for the COVID-19 pandemic and there is an urgent need to understand the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beclin-1 is an essential scaffold autophagy protein that forms two distinct subcomplexes with modulators Atg14 and UVRAG, responsible for autophagosome formation and maturation, respectively. In the present study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers an incomplete autophagy response, elevated autophagosome formation but impaired autophagosome maturation, and declined autophagy by genetic knockout of essential autophagic genes reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication efficiency. By screening 28 viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrated that expression of ORF3a alone is sufficient to induce incomplete autophagy. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a interacts with autophagy regulator UVRAG to facilitate Beclin-1-Vps34-Atg14 complex but selectively inhibit Beclin-1-Vps34-UVRAG complex. Interestingly, although SARS-CoV ORF3a shares 72.7% amino acid identity with the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, the former had no effect on cellular autophagy response. Thus, our findings provide the mechanistic evidence of possible takeover of host autophagy machinery by ORF3a to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 replication and raises the possibility of targeting the autophagic pathway for the treatment of COVID-19.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.12.380709;12/11/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9446

We compared three library preparation methods using both tagmentation (Nextera XT and Nextera Flex) and ligation-based (KAPA HyperPrep) approaches on both positive and negative samples to provide insights into any methodological differences between the methods, and validate their use in SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing. We show that all three library preparation methods allow us to recover near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes with identical SNP calls. The Nextera Flex and KAPA library preparation methods gave better coverage than libraries prepared with Nextera XT, which required more reads to call the same number of genomic positions. The KAPA ligation-based approach shows the lowest levels of human contamination, but contaminating reads had no effect on the downstream analysis. We found some examples of library preparation-specific differences in minority variant calling. Overall our data shows that the choice of Illumina library preparation method has minimal effects on consensus base calling and downstream phylogenetic analysis, and suggests that all methods would be suitable for use if specific reagents are difficult to obtain.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.154286;16/6/2020;Genomic surveillance;0.9915
1814;The effect of social fear on the establishment of fever standards in rural hospitals during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic;10.2185/jrm.2020-047;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has complicated the work of general physicians due to the vagueness of fever standards. Because of the high virulence of the causative virus, the disease is rapidly spreading worldwide, even reaching the rural areas in Japan. During the first wave of the pandemic, the Japanese government set the standard as a temperature of 37.5°C lasting for more than four days. However, after the government deleted this standard from its website, there was confusion in the medical institutions, as they struggled to set their fever standards. As a result, social fear might force healthcare professionals to bring down the standard for fever to increase the sensitivity and identify patients with COVID-19 more accurately. During the second wave, the fever standard was set at 37°C to enable high sensitivity. Subsequently, general physicians had to approach many people with temperatures higher than 37°C who came to the hospital seeking treatment for their symptoms or to visit their families. People seek to avoid contracting the COVID-19 infection for health-related and social reasons. When there is a possibility of healthcare professionals testing positive, hospitals may have to shut down and face criticism from society, as the mass media generally accuses these hospitals of mismanagement.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833841/; https://doi.org/10.2185/jrm.2020-047";1/4/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9605

Mortality is high in COVID pneumonia and it is the highest among the frailest. COVID could be particularly serious in patients with severe acquired brain injury (SABI), such as those with a disorder of consciousness. We here describe a cohort of patients with a disorder of consciousness exposed to SARS-CoV-2 early after their SABI. Materials and methods: The full cohort of 11 patients with SABI hospitalized in March 2020 in the IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi rehabilitation (Milan, Italy) was recruited. Participants received SARS-CoV-2 testing and different clinical and laboratory data were collected. Results: Six patients contracted SARS-CoV-2 and four of them developed the COVID. Of these, one patient had ground-glass opacities on the chest CT scan, while the remaining three developed consolidations. No patient died and the overall respiratory involvement was mild, requiring in the worst cases low-flow oxygen. Conclusions: Here we report the clinical course of a cohort of patients with SABI exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The infection spread among patients and caused COVID in some of them. Unexpectedly, COVID was moderate, caused at most mild respiratory distress and did not result in fatalities.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2021.1887937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33587672/";15/2/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9668

METHODS: An online self-reported survey was conducted in a tertiary hospital. Respondents were asked to report their perceived threat and perceived risk of infection, evaluation of hospital response, demographics, and job-related factors. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 441 employees participated in this study. Of respondents, 60% were willing to accept their work during an infectious disease outbreak and 12.5% were unwilling to accept the work. In addition, 8% of respondents reported that they had considered quitting their job, 54.4% reported that their job was dangerous, and 50.1% of respondents perceived the severity of COVID-19 as high. Perceived threat and effectiveness of hospital response were associated with hospital employees’ intention to work. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital workers are at the front line of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The aim of this study was to investigate how different types of primary care data can help quantify the effect of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis on mental health. A retrospective cohort study investigated changes in weekly counts of mental health consultations and prescriptions. The data were extracted from one the UK's largest primary care databases between January 1st 2015 and October 31st 2020 (end of follow-up). The 2020 trends were compared to the 2015-19 average with 95% confidence intervals using longitudinal plots and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). A total number of 504 practices (7,057,447 patients) contributed data. During the period of national restrictions, on average, there were 31% (3957 ± 269, p < 0.001) fewer events and 6% (4878 ± 1108, p < 0.001) more prescriptions per week as compared to the 2015-19 average. The number of events was recovering, increasing by 75 (± 29, p = 0.012) per week. Prescriptions returned to the 2015-19 levels by the end of the study (p = 0.854).

By antibodies obtained from convalescent COVID-19 individuals, receptor binding domain (RBD) were identified as immunodominant neutralizing domain that efficiently elicits neutralizing antibody response with on-going affinity mature. Moreover, we succeeded to define a quantitative antigenic map of neutralizing sites within SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and found that sites S2, S3 and S4 (new-found site) are conserved sites and determined as subimmunodominant sites, putatively due to their less accessibility than SARS-CoV-2 unique sites. P10-6G3, P07-4D10 and P05-6H7, respectively targeting S2, S3 and S4, are relatively rare antibodies that also potently neutralizes SARS-CoV, and the last mAbs performing neutralization without blocking S protein binding to receptor. Further, we have tried to design some RBDs to improve the immunogenicity of conserved sites. Our studies, focusing on conserved antigenic sites of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, provide insights for promoting development of universal SARS-like coronavirus vaccines therefore enhancing our pandemic preparedness.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.10.439161;11/4/2021;receptor binding domain;0.9838

However, the low femtomolar to attomolar concentration of nucleic acids in human samples require sensors with excellent detection capabilities; many past and current platforms fall short or are economically difficult. Strand-mediated signal amplifiers such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) are superior methods for detecting trace amounts of biomolecules because one target molecule triggers the continuous production of synthetic double-helical DNA. This cascade event is highly discriminatory to the target via sequence specificity, and it can be coupled with fluorescence, electrochemistry, magnetic moment, and electrochemiluminescence for signal reporting. Here, we review recent advances in enhancing the sensing abilities in HCR and CHA for improved live-cell imaging efficiency, lowered limit of detection, and optimized multiplexity. We further outline the potential for clinical translatability of HCR and CHA by summarizing progress in employing these two tools for in vivo imaging, human sample testing, and sensing-treating dualities.

The outbreak, which first occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and then rapidly spread to other provinces and to more than 200 countries abroad, has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Those with compromised immune systems and/or existing respiratory, metabolic or cardiac problems are more susceptible to the infection and are at higher risk of serious illness or even death. The present review was designed to report important functional food plants with immunomodulatory and anti‐viral properties. Data on medicinal food plants was retrieved and downloaded from English‐language journals using online search engines. The functional food plants herein documented might not only enhance the immune system and cure respiratory tract infections but can also greatly impact the overall health of the general public. As many people in the world are now confined to their homes, inclusion of these easily accessible plants in the daily diet may help to strengthen the immune system and guard against infection by SARS‐CoV‐2.

The perceived trustworthiness of strangers from the evaluation of their faces has been widely studies in social psychology; however, little is known about the possibility of transferring trustworthiness from human faces to other individuals, objects or interfaces. In this study, we explore how the perceived trustworthiness of automated teller machines (ATMs) is influenced by the presence of faces on the machines, and how the trustworthiness of the faces themselves is transferred to the machine. In our study, participants (N = 57) rated the trustworthiness of ATMs on which faces of different age, gender, and ethnicity are placed. Subsequently, the trustworthiness of the ATMs is compared to the trustworthiness ratings of faces presented on their own. Results of our works support the idea that faces’ trustworthiness can be transferred to objects on which faces are presented. Moreover, the trustworthiness of ATMs seems to be influenced by the age of presented faces, with ATMs on which children faces are presented are trusted more than the same machines when adults’ or elders’ faces are presented, but not by the ethnicity (Asian or Caucasian) or gender (male or female) of presented faces.";"https://doi.org/10.3390/bs11060091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205570/";21/6/2021;Trustworthiness;0.9553

Orthonasal olfactory function was assessed with the “Sniffin’ Sticks” test battery. Retronasal olfaction was assessed with oral odorant delivery using special containers for threshold function, and with oral tasteless powders for odor identification. RESULTS: Retronasal and orthonasal olfaction were significantly correlated for threshold scores, identification score, and the sum of threshold and identification score (TI score). Validity analyses showed that the retronasal TI score was able to discriminate between healthy controls and patients with olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Normosmic participants can be distinctly differentiated from patients with olfactory dysfunction using a valid test battery comprised of retronasal threshold and identification tests.

1824;Cell and Gene Therapy for Anemia: Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Gene Editing;10.3390/ijms22126275;Hereditary anemia has various manifestations, such as sickle cell disease (SCD), Fanconi anemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDD), and thalassemia. The available management strategies for these disorders are still unsatisfactory and do not eliminate the main causes. As genetic aberrations are the main causes of all forms of hereditary anemia, the optimal approach involves repairing the defective gene, possibly through the transplantation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a normal matching donor or through gene therapy approaches (either in vivo or ex vivo) to correct the patient’s HSCs. To clearly illustrate the importance of cell and gene therapy in hereditary anemia, this paper provides a review of the genetic aberration, epidemiology, clinical features, current management, and cell and gene therapy endeavors related to SCD, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, and G6PDD.

1825;Public Search Interests related to COVID-19: Insights from Google Search Trends in Bangladesh;10.1101/2020.12.26.20248858;ObjectivePublic response monitoring is critical to reducing COVID-19 infections and developing effective public health strategies. This study explored Google search trends to understand public responses to COVID-19 concerns in Bangladesh. MethodsWe used country-level Google search trends data to examine the association between Google search terms related to COVID-19 deaths, face masks, and COVID-19 vaccines and the actual and one-week lagged actual COVID-19 death counts from February 2, 2020, to December 19, 2020, in Bangladesh. Results: Search terms related to COVID-19 deaths, face masks, and COVID-19 vaccines increased and peaked during March and April, but then began declining gradually after June 2020. The mean relative search volume for face masks (35 points) was higher than for death information (8 points) and vaccines (16 points) throughout the study period, and searching for masks peaked (100 points) during the third week of March. Search interests for death information and face masks were negatively correlated with the actual and one-week lagged actual COVID-19 death counts. ConclusionIn response to declining trends in COVID-19-related google search terms, policymakers should strengthen ongoing risk communication and preventive information dissemination programs to control and prevent COVID-19 cases and deaths.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.20248858v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.26.20248858";1/1/2021;ObjectivePublic response monitoring;0.9046
1826;COVID (Co-Operative Vascular Intervention Disease) Team of Greater Philadelphia;10.1016/j.jvs.2020.05.058;We established the COVID (Co-OperativeVascularInterventionDisease) Team of Greater Philadelphia because national guidelines may not apply to different geographic areas of the United States due to varying penetrance of the virus. On April 10, 2020, a ten-question survey regarding issues and strategies dealing with COVID-19 was e-mailed to 58 VSs in the Greater Philadelphia area. Fifty-four VSs in 18 surgical groups covering 28 hospitals responded. All groups accepted transfers due to continued ICU bed availability. Thirteen groups were asked to “re-deploy” if the need arose to function outside of the usual duties of a VS. None imposed age restrictions regarding older VSs continuing clinical hospital work. The majority restricted non-invasive vascular laboratory studies to those studies where findings might mandate intervention within 2-3 weeks, restricted dialysis access operations to urgent revisions of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs)/ grafts that were failing or had ulcerations, converted from in-person to telemedicine clinic interactions, and experienced moderate/severe anxiety or fear about personal COVID-19 exposure in the hospital. The majority of VSs in the Philadelphia area have dramatically adjusted their clinical practices before the COVID-19 crisis reached peak levels experienced in other metropolitan areas.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2020.05.058; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0741521420313525; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521420313525?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32561268/";17/6/2020;Co-OperativeVascularInterventionDisease;0.941

Its success relies on having safe and effective vaccines and also on high levels of uptake by the public over time. Addressing questions of population-level acceptability, stability of acceptance and sub-population variation in acceptability are imperative. Using a prospective design, a repeated measures two-wave online survey was conducted to assess key sociodemographic variables and intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. The first survey (time 1) was completed by 3436 people during the period of national lockdown in Scotland and the second survey (n=2016) was completed two months later (time 2) when restrictions had been eased. At time one, 78% reported being willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Logistic regression analyses showed that there were clear sociodemographic differences in intention to accept a vaccine for COVID-19 with intention being higher in participants of white ethnicity in comparison to Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) groups, and in those with higher income levels and higher education levels. Intention was also higher in those who were 'shielding' due to underlying medical conditions.

This survey investigates strategies and uncertainties on resumption of elective activity. Methods: Directors of 55 EDs in Northern Italy received a questionnaire focusing on the impact of pandemic on activity and organization and on the resources available at re-opening. A section was devoted to gather forecasts and proposals on the return path to normality. Results: All centres had reduced their activities of at least 50% of the pre-COVID-19 period. A rate of endoscopists (13.6%), nurses (25.2%), and health assistants (14%) were not available since infected, or relocated to other departments. One third of endoscopic rooms were converted to COVID-19 care. Two third had the waiting or the recovery areas too small for distancing. A dedicated pathway for infected patients could not be guaranteed in 20% of EDs. Only one third of EDs judged realistic to completely restore a pre-crisis workload by the next months. Optimizing appropriateness of procedures, closer interaction with GPs and triaging patients with telemedicine were the proposals to re-open EDs. Conclusions: The critical issues while re-opening EDs calls for reducing the workload in the endoscopy units through appropriate rescheduling of procedures.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.20092270; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.12.20092270v1?rss=1";13/5/2020;Endoscopic Departments;0.9503

The goal of this study was to use qualitative methods to better understand experiences with food access and perceptions of the food environment among low-income, predominately Black rural Louisiana residents in the United States. Data were collected from focus group discussions (FGD) and focus group intake forms. Study participants were all rural residents eligible to receive at least one nutrition assistance program. FGD questions focused on perceptions of the food environment, with an emphasis on food access. Participants (n = 44) were predominately Black and female. Over half (n = 25) reported running out of food before the end of the month. Major themes included: store choice, outshopping, methods of acquiring foods other than the grocery store, and food insecurity. Concerns around price, quality, and transportation emerged as factors negatively impacting food security. Understanding residents’ perceptions and experiences is necessary to inform contextually appropriate and feasible policy and practice interventions that address the physical environment and social conditions that shape the broader physical food environment in order to achieve equitable food access and food security.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32722214/";24/7/2020;focus group discussions;0.9673

An online survey was conducted through snowball sampling technique and total 367 people participated in the survey. The results of the study show that COVID‐19 cases spiked amid ease of lockdown in the country and the spread of novel coronavirus pandemic has significant socioeconomic impact on the lives of mountain communities in Gilgit‐Baltistan. Financial uncertainty, decrease in income, fear of job loss, and food insecurity are some major challenges that mountain communities face due to outbreak of coronavirus in the region. The results further show that lack of community cooperation with government agencies, lack of awareness about the severity of coronavirus, and insufficient COVID‐19 testing kits are the major factors that caused the spread of coronavirus cases. This study suggests that the short‐, medium‐, and long‐term policies are required to mitigate the consequences of this pandemic and to revitalize the mountain economy of Gilgit‐Baltistan, and in this regard, this study provides baseline information for policy‐makers and practitioners to devise such demanding policies.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/pa.2355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904946/";24/8/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9003
1832;Immune responses and pathogenesis in persistently PCR‐positive patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection;10.1002/jmv.26287;Coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 emerged in China in December 2019 and then rapidly spread worldwide. Why COVID‐19 patients with the same clinical condition have different outcomes remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the differences in the phenotype and functions of major populations of immune cells between COVID‐19 patients with same severity but different outcomes. Four common type adult inpatients with laboratory confirmed COVID‐19 from Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not COVID‐19 PCR‐negative conversion occurred within three weeks. Peripheral blood samples were collected to compare the differences in the phenotype and functions of major populations of immune cells between the two groups of patients. The result shows that the proportions of CD3(+)CD8(+)CD38(+)HLA‐DR(+)CD27(‐) effector T killer cells generally declined, whereas that of CD3(+)CD4(+)CD8(+) double‐positive T cells (DPTs) increased in the persistently PCR‐positive patients. In summary, considering the imbalance between effector T killer cells/ CD3+CD4+CD8+ DPTs was a possible key factor for PCR‐negative conversion in COVID‐19 patients. This article is protected by  .

1833;Dual-Component Deep Domain Adaptation: A New Approach for Cross Project Software Vulnerability Detection;10.1007/978-3-030-47426-3_54;Owing to the ubiquity of computer software, software vulnerability detection (SVD) has become an important problem in the software industry and computer security. One of the most crucial issues in SVD is coping with the scarcity of labeled vulnerabilities in projects that require the laborious manual labeling of code by software security experts. One possible solution is to employ deep domain adaptation (DA) which has recently witnessed enormous success in transferring learning from structural labeled to unlabeled data sources. Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a technique that attempts to bridge the gap between source and target data in the joint space and emerges as a building block to develop deep DA approaches with state-of-the-art performance. However, deep DA approaches using the GAN principle to close the gap are subject to the mode collapsing problem that negatively impacts the predictive performance. Our aim in this paper is to propose Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-DDAN) for tackling the problem of transfer learning from labeled to unlabeled software projects in SVD to resolve the mode collapsing problem faced in previous approaches. The experimental results on real-world software projects show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206170/;17/4/2020;software vulnerability detection;0.9921
1834;Health care team training and simulation-based education in obstetrics during the COVID-19 pandemic;10.1016/j.jogc.2020.05.007;ABSTRACT Health care team training and simulation-based education are important for preparing obstetrical services to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Priorities for training are identified in two key areas. First, the impact of infection prevention and control protocols on processes of care (e.g., appropriate and correct use of personal protective equipment, patient transport, preparation for emergency cesarean delivery with the potential for emergency intubation, management of simultaneous obstetric emergencies, delivery in alternate locations in the hospital, potential for increased decision-to-delivery intervals, and communication with patients). And second, the effects of COVID-19 pathophysiology on obstetrical patients (e.g., testing and diagnosis, best use of modified obstetric early warning systems, approach to maternal respiratory compromise, collaboration with critical care teams, and potential need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation). However, such training is more challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic because of the requirements for social distancing. This article outlines strategies (spatial, temporal, video-recording, video-conferencing, and virtual) to effectively engage in health care team training and simulation-based education while maintaining social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1701216320304709?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2020.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736852/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1701216320304709";30/5/2020;pathophysiology;0.906

Employers have a duty of care to minimise the risk for their employees. Several bodies including the Faculty of Occupational Medicine, NHS Employers, and Public Health England have published a requirement to perform risk assessments for all health care workers, however, with the absence of an objective risk stratification tool, comparing assessments between individuals is difficult if not impossible. Using published data, we explored the predictive role of basic demographics such as age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities in order to establish an objective risk stratification tool that could help risk allocate duties to health care workers. We developed an objective risk stratification tool using a Caucasian female <50years of age with no comorbidities as a reference. Each point allocated to risk factors was associated with an approximate doubling in risk. This tool was then validated against the primary care-based analysis. This tool provides objective support for employers when determining which healthcare workers should be allocated to high-risk vs. lower risk patient facing clinical duties or to remote supportive roles.;";"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.20091967; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.05.20091967v1?rss=1";9/5/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9496
1836;Codon-based indices for modeling gene expression and transcript evolution;10.1016/j.csbj.2021.04.042;"Codon usage bias (CUB) refers to the phenomena that synonymous codons are used in different frequencies in most genes and organisms. The general assumption is that codon biases reflect a balance between mutational biases and natural selection. Today we understand that the codon content is related and can affect all gene expression steps. Starting from the 1980s, codon-based indices have been used for answering different questions in all biomedical fields, including systems biology, agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology. In general, codon usage bias indices weigh each codon or a small set of codons to estimate the fitting of a certain coding sequence to a certain phenomenon (e.g., bias in codons, adaptation to the tRNA pool, frequencies of certain codons, transcription elongation speed, etc.) and are usually easy to implement. Today there are dozens of such indices; thus, this paper aims to review and compare the different codon usage bias indices, their applications, and advantages. In addition, we perform analysis that demonstrates that most indices tend to correlate even though they aim to capture different aspects. Due to the centrality of codon usage bias on different gene expression steps, it is important to keep developing new indices that can capture additional aspects that are not modeled with the current indices.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8122159/;22/4/2021;Codon usage bias;0.9723

In this paper, Haynes 230 (H230), a solid solution strengthened Ni-based superalloy, was chosen to meet the material requirements of a microchannel solar receiver (MSR) needed to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of solar thermal power generation. A MPD was developed to enable the cost-effective production of the MSR. This MPD revealed the need to increase the height-to-diameter aspect ratio of posts using electrically-assisted (EA) forming to reduce the mass and cost of MSR fluidic interconnects. Preliminary efforts to validate the MPD through fabrication of sub-scale MSR test articles resulted in several process failures. Among them, die and platen failure, accelerated creep during bonding due to grain refinement as a result of forming. This resulted in poorly formed channels in the final bonded devices. Suggestions for EA forming die material and adjusted forming setup geometry to reduce feature variability are discussed. Results suggest the need to perform solutionizing heat treatments of H230 after EA forming, prior to diffusion bonding, in order to meet the requirements of the MSR.

One of the most promising, if they can be successfully developed, is vaccines. While the technological development of such countermeasures is currently underway, a key social gap remains. Past experience in routine and crisis contexts demonstrates that uptake of vaccines is more complicated than simply making the technology available. Vaccine uptake, and especially the widespread acceptance of vaccines, is a social endeavor that requires consideration of human factors. To provide a starting place for this critical component of a future COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States, the 23-person Working Group on Readying Populations for COVID-19 Vaccines was formed. One outcome of this group is a synthesis of the major challenges and opportunities associated with a future COVID-19 vaccination campaign and empirically-informed recommendations to advance public understanding of, access to, and acceptance of vaccines that protect against SARS-CoV-2.

They become distressed when they have problems with interpersonal conflict, change, and loss of relationships. In this article, we review the basics of IPT and then describe the ways in which cultural adaptations can be made for people in Asia.

While it allows for improved cosmesis, faster recovery and decreased length of hospital stay compared with the open approach, instrument articulation limitations can hamper surgical dexterity in pediatric patients. Use of robotic assistance can greatly enhance operative field visualization and instrument control, and is in the early stages of adoption in academic centers for pediatric populations. CASE PRESENTATION We present a single-institution series of pediatric adrenalectomy cases. The da Vinci Xi surgical system was used to perform adrenalectomies on three consecutive patients (ages, 2-13 years) at our center. Final pathology revealed ganglioneuroblastoma (n = 2) and pheochromocytoma (n = 1). Median operating time was 244 min (range, 244-265 min); median blood loss was estimated at 100 ml (range, 15-175 ml). Specimens were delivered intact and all margins were negative. Median post-operative hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-6 days). All patients remain disease-free at median follow-up of 19 months (range, 12-30 months).

A total of 1,680 7th to 12th grade students enrolled at a large middle-high school located in Southwest China completed an online survey measuring mood states, physical activity, screen time, conflicts with parents, and body height and weight. Physical activity, particularly of at least 150 minutes' duration each week, significantly decreased the likelihood of negative mood among adolescents during lockdown. Screen time, specifically other than that spent on online study, had a negative association with mood, after controlling for the relevant variables (i.e., physical activity and body mass index). Less screen time and accumulating 150 minutes of physical activity were associated with fewer conflicts with parents. With the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, local school districts, school leaders, and health professionals should develop greater awareness of potential problems with, and engage parents in developing specific guidance on controlling, screen time and promoting physical activity in a time-sensitive manner.

It has upended lives and livelihoods and created a state of despair. Many countries are still reeling from the impact of the pandemic . Notwithstanding this, the pandemic has also exposed mankind to a startling reality - specifically the fundamental weaknesses in our global system, the prevalence of poverty, the lack of social-protection mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable, weak health systems and above all the need for global cooperation. The on-going crisis has also re-enforced the interdependence of our world and has brought to the fore the urgent need for global action to meet people’s basic needs, to save our planet and to build a fairer and more secure world, all of which have been canvassed within the framework of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) . The chapter explores issues relating to the pandemic and their implications for sustainable development. It seeks to draw parallels between the two by arguing that the crisis, despite its ferocity, has proved an opportunity for mankind to ramp up actions necessary to achieve the SDGs .

1844;Evidence for anti-viral effects of complete Freunds adjuvant in the mouse model of enterovirus infection;10.1101/2020.05.27.120121;Group B Coxsackieviruses belonging to the genus, Enterovirus, contain six serotypes that induce various diseases, whose occurrence may involve the mediation of more than one serotype. We recently identified immunogenic epitopes within CVB3 viral protein 1 that induce anti-viral T cell responses in mouse models of CVB infections. In our investigations to determine the protective responses of the viral epitopes, we unexpectedly noted that animals immunized with complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) alone and later challenged with CVB3 were completely protected against myocarditis. Similarly, the pancreatitis-inducing ability of CVB3 was remarkably reduced to only 10% in the CFA group as opposed to 73.3% in the control group that received no CFA. Additionally, no mortalities were noted in the CFA group, whereas 40% of control animals died during the course of 21 days post-infection with CVB3. Taken together, our data suggest that the adjuvant effects of CFA may be sufficient for protection against CVB infections. These observations may provide new insights into our understanding of the occurrence of viral infections. One example is Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) as individuals suffering from COVID-19 who have been vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin appear to have fewer morbidities and mortalities than unvaccinated individuals.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.27.120121;28/5/2020;Coronavirus disease-19;0.9768
1845;New Bioconjugated Technetium and Rhenium Folates Synthesized by Transmetallation Reaction with Zinc Derivatives.;10.3390/molecules26082373;The zinc dithiocarbamates functionalized with folic acid 2Zn and 3Zn were synthesized with a simple straightforward method, using an appropriated folic acid derivative and a functionalized zinc dithiocarbamate (1Zn). Zinc complexes 2Zn and 3Zn show very low solubilities in water, making them useful for preparing Tc-99m radiopharmaceuticals with a potentially high molar activity. Thus, the transmetallation reaction in water medium between the zinc complexes 2Zn or 3Zn and the cation fac-[99mTc(H2O)3(CO)3]+, in the presence of the monodentate ligand TPPTS, leads to the formation of the 2 + 1 complexes fac-[99mTc(CO)3(SS)(P)] bioconjugated to folic acid (2Tc and 3Tc). In spite of the low solubility of 2Zn and 3Zn in water, the reaction yield is higher than 95%, and the excess zinc reagent is easily removed by centrifugation. The Tc-99m complexes were characterized by comparing their HPLC with those of the homologous rhenium complexes (2Re and 3Re) previously synthesized and characterized by standard methods. Preliminary in vivo studies with 2Tc and 3Tc indicate low specific binding to folate receptors. In summary, Tc-99m folates 2Tc and 3Tc were prepared in high yields, using a one-pot transmetallation reaction with low soluble zinc dithiocarbamates (>1 ppm), at moderate temperature, without needing a subsequent purification step.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26082373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921789/";19/4/2021;centrifugation;0.9585
1846;Proteomic signatures of 16 major types of human cancer reveal universal and cancer-type-specific proteins for the identification of potential therapeutic targets;10.1186/s13045-020-01013-x;BACKGROUND: Proteomic characterization of cancers is essential for a comprehensive understanding of key molecular aberrations. However, proteomic profiling of a large cohort of cancer tissues is often limited by the conventional approaches. METHODS: We present a proteomic landscape of 16 major types of human cancer, based on the analysis of 126 treatment-naïve primary tumor tissues, 94 tumor-matched normal adjacent tissues, and 12 normal tissues, using mass spectrometry-based data-independent acquisition approach. RESULTS: In our study, a total of 8527 proteins were mapped to brain, head and neck, breast, lung (both small cell and non-small cell lung cancers), esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, colon, kidney, bladder, prostate, uterus and ovary cancers, including 2458 tissue-enriched proteins. Our DIA-based proteomic approach has characterized major human cancers and identified universally expressed proteins as well as tissue-type-specific and cancer-type-specific proteins. In addition, 1139 therapeutic targetable proteins and 21 cancer/testis (CT) antigens were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our discoveries not only advance our understanding of human cancers, but also have implications for the design of future large-scale cancer proteomic studies to assist the development of diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets in multiple cancers.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7720039/;7/12/2020;Proteomic characterization of cancers;0.9332

Inflammatory activation and dysfunction of the endothelium are key events in the development and pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and are associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular events. There is great interest to further understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis progression, and to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to prevent endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis and to reduce the risk of developing CAD and its complications. The use of liquid biopsies and new molecular biology techniques have allowed the identification of a growing list of molecular and cellular markers of endothelial dysfunction, which have provided insight on the molecular basis of atherosclerosis and are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the prevention and or treatment of atherosclerosis and CAD. This review describes recent information on normal vascular endothelium function, as well as traditional and novel potential biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies aimed to protect the endothelium or reverse endothelial damage, as a preventive treatment for CAD and related complications.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8068178/;8/4/2021;Coronary artery disease;0.9727
1848;A Department Approach to Teleneurology.;10.1089/tmj.2020.0323;The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has compelled health care practices and academic departments to evaluate the suitability of telemedicine for various specialties and attempt rapid implementation to enable continuation of health care that is safe for providers and patients. Many patients with neurological disorders are well suited to evaluations through video. The department of neurology at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Neurology), with the support of the health system, rapidly expanded telemedicine services to meet the needs of our patient population. This accomplishment required the complex coordination of multiple disciplines and roles within the department and the health care system, including faculty, residents, administrative staff, research and technical staff, information services, and the connected health team. Procedures for provider and patient education were established. Surveys of the provider and patient experience were developed and deployed. The process has demonstrated the vital role telemedicine in neurology (teleneurology) should play in the care of neurological patients beyond the pandemic. We describe our experience as a template for other departments and practices seeking to establish teleneurology programs, as well as an illustration of the challenges and barriers to its implementation.;"https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337290/";18/12/2020;coronavirus disease-19;0.9524
1849;Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic in Nigeria: Preventive and Control Challenges within the First Two Months of Outbreak.;10.29063/ajrh2020/v24i2s.13;The spread of the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has continued to rise in Nigeria despite all scientifically proven preventive measures. Factors militating against preventive and control efforts are yet to be addressed thus the study examined COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria within the first two months of outbreak and its preventive and control challenges. Data from the daily updates of Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) were graphically used to describe the trend of spread while facts from both verified online and print media reports on COVID-19 were used to assess the challenges. Outcome of the study showed a steady increase in COVID-19 from one case on the 27thof February 2020 to 1,932 confirmed cases, 58 fatalities, and 319 discharged cases by 30th April 2020. COVID-19 preventive measures in the country include hand washing, use of sanitizers, wearing of face masks, lockdown and social distancing. Factors which undermined government preventive efforts were poor compliance attitude, selective lockdown, social media interference, misconceptions and myths, stigmatization, fear, inadequate health facilities, and distrust for government. It is recommended among others that there is need to ameliorate the adverse effects of COVID-19 misconceptions and myths through evidence-based campaigns using all sources of information.;"https://doi.org/10.29063/ajrh2020/v24i2s.13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34077058/";1/6/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9646
1850;Ultrasound as a Learning Tool in Bachelor-Level Anatomy Education;10.1007/s40670-020-01170-1;Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) has become an increasingly common diagnostic tool in the clinical environment. As a result, it is being used earlier for medical students in Undergraduate Medical Education (UME) as a learning tool for the basic sciences including gross anatomy. There is little literature, however, to support its utility for basic science education in students currently seeking a bachelor’s degree. This study consisted of fourteen currently enrolled bachelor students with previous instruction in human anatomy and physiology. Students participated in an ultrasound didactic and an interactive ultrasound experience with volunteers. Before and after this session, students were asked to complete an assessment measuring their spatial understanding of the human anatomy and their ability to locate structures using ultrasound. Wilcoxon’s signed-rank tests comparing assessment scores showed significant improvement on both portions of the assessment. Based on this improvement, we suggest that ultrasound is a valid educational tool which can be used at the bachelor-level to effectively enhance students’ learning of anatomy and provide hands on experience with modern technology. Further research with larger samples will be necessary to determine whether it would supplement or replace more traditional teaching modalities.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262901/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40670-020-01170-1";25/11/2020;Point of care ultrasound;0.9883
1851;African Swine Fever Laboratory Diagnosis—Lessons Learned from Recent Animal Trials;10.3390/pathogens10020177;African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a hemorrhagic disease in pigs with high socio-economic consequences. To lower the impact of disease incursions, early detection is crucial. In the context of experimental animal trials, we evaluated diagnostic workflows for a high sample throughput in active surveillance, alternative sample matrices for passive surveillance, and lateral flow devices (LFD) for rapid testing. We could demonstrate that EDTA blood is significantly better suited for early ASFV detection than serum. Tissues recommended by the respective diagnostic manuals were in general comparable in their performance, with spleen samples giving best results. Superficial lymph nodes, ear punches, and different blood swabs were also evaluated as potential alternatives. In summary, all matrices yielded positive results at the peak of clinical signs and could be fit for purpose in passive surveillance. However, weaknesses were discovered for some matrices when it comes to the early phase of infection or recovery. The antigen LFD showed variable results with best performance in the clinical phase. The antibody LFD was quite comparable with ELISA systems. Concluding, alternative approaches are feasible but have to be embedded in control strategies selecting test methods and sample materials following a “fit-for-purpose” approach.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10020177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33562103/";6/2/2021;lateral flow devices;0.967
1852;New Mexico’s COVID-19 Experience;10.1097/paf.0000000000000664;The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, infiltrating, infecting, and devastating communities in all locations of varying demographics. An overwhelming majority of published literature on the pathologic findings associated with COVID-19 is either from living clinical cohorts or from autopsy findings of those who died in a medical care setting, which can confound pure disease pathology. A relatively low initial infection rate paired with a high biosafety level enabled the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator to conduct full autopsy examinations on suspected COVID-19–related deaths. Full autopsy examination on the first 20 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2–positive decedents revealed that some extent of diffuse alveolar damage in every death due to COVID-19 played some role. The average decedent was middle-aged, male, American Indian, and overweight with comorbidities that included diabetes, ethanolism, and atherosclerotic and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease. Macroscopic thrombotic events were seen in 35% of cases consisting of pulmonary thromboemboli and coronary artery thrombi. In 2 cases, severe bacterial coinfections were seen in the lungs. Those determined to die with but not of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection had unremarkable lung findings.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33416234/; https://doi.org/10.1097/paf.0000000000000664";8/1/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9647
1853;Structure, Dynamics, Receptor Binding, and Antibody Binding of Fully-glycosylated Full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein in a Viral Membrane;10.1101/2020.10.18.343715;The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediates host cell entry by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and is considered the major target for drug and vaccine development. We previously built fully-glycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein models in a viral membrane including both open and closed conformations of receptor binding domain (RBD) and different templates for the stalk region. In this work, multiple μs-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide deeper insight into the structure and dynamics of S protein, and glycan functions. Our simulations reveal that the highly flexible stalk is composed of two independent joints and most probable S protein orientations are competent for ACE2 binding. We identify multiple glycans stabilizing the open and/or closed states of RBD, and demonstrate that the exposure of antibody epitopes can be captured by detailed antibody-glycan clash analysis instead of a commonly-used accessible surface area analysis that tends to overestimate the impact of glycan shielding and neglect possible detailed interactions between glycan and antibody. Overall, our observations offer structural and dynamic insight into SARS-CoV-2 S protein and potentialize for guiding the design of effective antiviral therapeutics.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.18.343715;18/10/2020;receptor binding domain;0.9769
1854;Telemedicine for pediatric physiatry: How social distancing can bring physicians and families closer together.;10.3233/prm-200747;The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic triggered wide scale implementation of telemedicine in the United States. The government response, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, permitted loosening of existing restrictions on telemedicine enabling its rapid incorporation into the delivery of medical care for children and adults. Prior to COVID-19, few pediatric physiatrists had opportunities to access high fidelity telemedicine platforms to provide health care for patients with special needs, mobility impairments, developmental delays, neuromuscular disorders or other complex medical conditions. This literature review will explore how telemedicine can optimize health care delivery options for pediatric physiatrists in various inpatient and outpatient settings such as consultations, acute inpatient units, outpatient clinics and long-term care facilities. Detailed analysis of the current research in telemedicine applications as well as a critical review of the limitations and barriers for its use offers a plethora of opportunities for enhancement of continuity and coordination of care. Telemedicine may decrease healthcare disparities and increase access of care for children with special needs.

1855;Active Aging Governance and Challenges at the Local Level.;10.3390/geriatrics6030064;International and national guidelines have been promoting active aging while creating the necessary means for decision-makers and other relevant actors to work together (governance mechanisms) to implement local and active aging policies. This is especially important in the present COVID-19 pandemic context, posing greater challenges on older people who tend to be self-isolated. How are local actors conceptualizing active aging? What are their priorities related to a healthy life for older people? Which governance mechanisms are used to implement such policies? These are some of the questions addressed in this paper, targeting Portugal, a southern European country. A mixed-methods sequential explanatory design combining a survey conducted at a national level and interviews with key actors in the NUTS III Aveiro Region was employed to identify and understand the underpinning governance mechanisms. Findings confirm the 'passive organization type' in which European politico-territorial studies tend to place Portugal, as there are gaps in the way policies are formulated, implemented and evaluated, as well as a lack of coordination. Results of this study have important impacts on the way local governments and other stakeholders will prepare themselves in the post-pandemic period to design and implement policies addressing active aging.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/geriatrics6030064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202217/";25/6/2021;governance mechanisms;0.9619

Coupled with protective stay at home guidelines, clinical research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ISMMS ADRC) needed to quickly adapt to remain operational and maintain our cohort of research participants. Data collected by the ISMMS ADRC as well as from other National Institute on Aging (NIA) Alzheimer Disease centers, follows the guidance of the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC). However, at the start of this pandemic, NACC had no alternative data collection mechanisms that could accommodate these safety guidelines. To stay in touch with our cohort and to ensure continued data collection under different stages of quarantine, the ISMMS ADRC redeployed their work force to continue their observational study via telehealth assessment. On the basis of this experience and that of other centers, NACC was able to create a data collection process to accommodate remote assessment in mid-August.

Women who receive late or infrequent prenatal care are at high risk for complications including preterm birth, infant death, and stillbirth. We sought to better understand the barriers Spanish-speaking women face in accessing quality prenatal care and to identify facilitators in obtaining timely quality prenatal care.METHODS We recruited a homogeneous group of 11 women with Spanish as their primary language who were pregnant or had given birth within the last six months. We then conducted two focus groups in Spanish. The focus groups were recorded, translated, and transcribed, and then coded using grounded theory.RESULTS In our cohort of participants, the three major themes included desire for psychosocial support, health care system logistics, and barriers due to Latinx ethnicity.LIMITATIONS Our study has several limitations, including a small sample size and single site design.CONCLUSION Latinx women experience unique barriers to care including language barriers, a lack of cultural competency on the part of health care personnel, and ethnic discrimination.

This piece of legislation addresses treatment, prevention, recovery, and enforcement with particular attention to access in rural areas. It contains numerous provisions to improve needed access to treat substance use disorders and especially opioid use disorder (OUD), including mandatory coverage of medications for OUD, partial elimination of Medicaid payment for inpatient mental health treatment, and state planning grants to increase provider capacity. Many of these provisions would be significantly enhanced by removing barriers to prescriptive authority for Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), including Nurse Practitioners, Clinical Nurse Specialists, Certified Nurse Midwives, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists, and other state-specific titles for nurses whose scope allows the prescription of controlled substances.

However, quite recently, such research regarding relationships between the health conditions of residents and toxic elements in the TSMD began to grow. The increase of empirical studies means greater complexity of the findings that require a more intricate understanding. To meet the goals of this study, an extensive, systematic review of the literature using PRISMA was conducted. This method resulted in 19 articles that define the harmful effects of the TSMD on the ecology and the physical health of residents. This research found that toxic metals not only negatively impact natural processes in the TSMD environments (fish species reduction, kidney and liver problems, and toxic diet) but also continuously affect the health of residents (high blood Pb and mortality).This study makes a vital contribution building upon the existing outcomes of the correlations between toxic elements in the TSMD areas and the health of residents.

1861;Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry Based Approach for the Determination of Methionine-Related Sulfur-Containing Compounds in Human Saliva;10.3390/ijms21239252;Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry technique (GC-MS) is mainly recognized as a tool of first choice when volatile compounds are determined. Here, we provide the credible evidence that its application in analysis can be extended to non-volatile sulfur-containing compounds, to which methionine (Met), homocysteine (Hcy), homocysteine thiolactone (HTL), and cysteine (Cys) belong. To prove this point, the first method, based on GC-MS, for the identification and quantification of Met-related compounds in human saliva, has been elaborated. The assay involves simultaneous disulfides reduction with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and acetonitrile (MeCN) deproteinization, followed by preconcentration by drying under vacuum and treatment of the residue with a derivatizing mixture containing anhydrous pyridine, N-trimethylsilyl-N-methyl trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA), and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS). The validity of the method was demonstrated based upon US FDA recommendations. The assay linearity was observed over the range of 0.5–20 µmol L(−1) for Met, Hcy, Cys, and 1–20 µmol L(−1) for HTL in saliva. The limit of quantification (LOQ) equals 0.1 µmol L(−1) for Met, Hcy, Cys, while its value for HTL was 0.05 µmol L(−1). The method was successfully applied to saliva samples donated by apparently healthy volunteers (n = 10).;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21239252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291575/";4/12/2020;ethylchlorosilane;0.978

Although, the disease appears on the African continent late, it has spread to virtually all the countries. We provide early spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19 within the first 62 days of the disease's appearance on the African continent. We used a two-parameter hurdle Poisson model to simultaneously analyze the zero counts and the frequency of occurrence. We investigate the effects of important healthcare capacities including hospital beds and number of medical doctors in the different countries. The results show that cases of the pandemic vary geographically across Africa with notable high incidence in neighboring countries particularly in West and North Africa. The burden of the disease (per 100,000) was most felt in Djibouti Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. Temporally, during the first 4 weeks, the burden was highest in Senegal, Egypt and Mauritania, but by mid-April it shifted to Somalia, Chad, Guinea, Tanzania, Gabon, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. Currently, Namibia, Angola, South Sudan, Burundi and Uganda have the least burden.

It has also induced some changes in working habits at dermatology clinics. The majority of dermatology clinics limited the number of patients at outpatient clinics and postponed the elective procedures. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To evaluate the working conditions and habits of dermatologists in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This is a survey study with seventeen questions in which two hundred fifteen dermatologists working in Turkey participated. RESULTS Our results revealed that 53.5% of the participants worked in the areas related to COVID-19 during the pandemic. The average number of dermatology outpatient days in a week was five among the 48.8% of dermatologists, 21.4% of those had three working days, and 18.1% of those had four days.

1866;Suicidal Presentations to Emergency Departments in a Large Australian Public Health Service over 10 Years;10.3390/ijerph17165920;This paper presents trends and characteristics for 32,094 suicidal presentations to two Emergency Departments (EDs) in a large health service in Australia across a 10-year period (2009–2018). Prevalence of annual suicidal presentations and for selected groups of consumers (by sex, age groups, and ethnicity) was determined from a machine learning diagnostic algorithm developed for this purpose and a Bayesian estimation approach. A linear increase in the number of suicidal presentations over 10 years was observed, which was 2.8-times higher than the increase noted in all ED presentations and 6.1-times higher than the increase in the population size. Females had higher presentation rates than males, particularly among younger age groups. The highest rates of presentations were by persons aged 15–24. Overseas-born persons had around half the rates of suicidal presentations than Australian-born persons, and Indigenous persons had 2.9-times higher rates than non-Indigenous persons. Of all presenters, 70.6% presented once, but 5.7% had five or more presentations. Seasonal distribution of presentations showed a peak at the end of spring and a decline in winter months. These findings can inform the allocation of health resources and guide the development of suicide prevention strategies for people presenting to hospitals in suicidal crisis.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7460475/;14/8/2020;Emergency Departments;0.9226
1867;Expert recommendations on blood purification treatment protocol for patients with severe COVID-19(): Recommendation and consensus;10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.04.002;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan in December 2019. The World Health Organization defined the subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide as a public health emergency of international concern. Epidemiological data indicate that at least 20% of COVID-19 patients have severe disease. In addition to impairment of the respiratory system, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication. Immune damage mediated by cytokine storms and concomitant AKI is a key factor for poor prognosis. Based on previous experience of blood purification for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome combined with clinical front-line practice, we developed a blood purification protocol for patients with severe COVID-19. This protocol is divided into four major steps. The first step is to assess whether patients with severe COVID-19 require blood purification. The second step is to prescribe a blood purification treatment for patients with COVID-19. The third step is to monitor and adjust parameters of blood purification. The fourth step is to evaluate the timing of discontinuation of blood purification. It is expected that blood purification will play a key role in effectively reducing the mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 through the standardized implementation of the present protocol.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095882X20300372; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095882X20300372; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346492/";28/4/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9772
1868;Non‐canonical autophagy functions of ATG16L1 in epithelial cells limit lethal infection by influenza A virus;10.15252/embj.2020105543;Influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) cause pandemic infections where cytokine storm syndrome and lung inflammation lead to high mortality. Given the high social and economic cost of respiratory viruses, there is an urgent need to understand how the airways defend against virus infection. Here we use mice lacking the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 to demonstrate that ATG16L1‐dependent targeting of LC3 to single‐membrane, non‐autophagosome compartments – referred to as non‐canonical autophagy – protects mice from lethal IAV infection. Mice with systemic loss of non‐canonical autophagy are exquisitely sensitive to low‐pathogenicity IAV where extensive viral replication throughout the lungs, coupled with cytokine amplification mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, leads to fulminant pneumonia, lung inflammation and high mortality. IAV was controlled within epithelial barriers where non‐canonical autophagy reduced IAV fusion with endosomes and activation of interferon signalling. Conditional mouse models and ex vivo analysis showed that protection against IAV infection of lung was independent of phagocytes and other leucocytes. This establishes non‐canonical autophagy in airway epithelial cells as a novel innate defence that restricts IAV infection and lethal inflammation at respiratory surfaces.;"https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020105543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33586810/";15/2/2021;SARS‐CoV‐2;0.9852
1869;Is it possible to continue academic teaching in surgery during the COVID pandemic era?;10.1080/13645706.2020.1845210;In the era of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we critically appraised the literature by means of a systematic review on surgical education and propose an educational curriculum with the aid of available technologies. We performed a literature search on 10 May 2020 of Medline/PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and major journals with specific COVID-19 sections. Articles eligible for inclusion contained the topic of education in surgery in the context of COVID-19. Specific questions we aimed to answer were: Is there any difference in surgical education from pre-COVID-19 to now? How does technology assist us in teaching? Can we better harness technology to augment resident training? Two-hundred and twenty-six articles were identified, 21 relevant for our aim: 14 case studies, three survey analyses, three reviews and one commentary. The collapse of the traditional educational system due to social distancing caused a fragmentation of knowledge, a reduced acquisition of skills and a decreased employment of surgical trainees. These problems can be partially overcome by using new technologies and arranging 2-weeks rotation shifts, alternating clinical activities with learning. While medical care will remain largely based on the interaction with patients, students' adaptability to innovation will be a characteristic of post-COVID classes.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2020.1845210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241969/";26/11/2020;coronavirus;0.9915

Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection in each country which got affected on a daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies are critical for our further actions. To date, the statistics of COVID‐19 reported cases show that more than 80% of infected are mild cases of disease, around 14% of infected have severe complications, and about 5% are categorized as critical disease victims. Today's report (5th April 2020; daily updates in the prepared website) shows that the confirmed cases of COVID‐19 in the United States, Spain, Italy, and Germany are 308850, 126168, 124632, and 96092, respectively. Calculating the total case fatality rate (CFR) of Italy (4th April 2020), about 13.3% of confirmed cases have passed away. Compared with South Korea's rate of 1.8% (seven times lower than Italy) and China's 4% (69% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high.

Through the analysis of the mitochondrial gene COI, species delimitation methods (ABGD, GB, GMYC, bPTP) were applied, recognizing 6–7 OTUs with absolute pairwise genetic distances ranging between 8 and 22%. The onset of diversification is estimated to be within the middle Miocene and both dispersal and vicariance-shaped A. spilauchen diversity and distribution, as suggested by time-calibrated and ancestral range reconstruction (S-DIVA) analyses. We report for the first time, a pattern of diversification within a lineage of brackish water fish that is concordant with the historical distribution of coastal mangroves forests, shaped by a series of historical events that likely affected forest cover since the middle Miocene (e.g. major climate shifts and sea-level fluctuations, onset of the modern Congo River outlet, increased volcanism in the Cameroon Volcanic Line).

1872;Autism Spectrum Disorder from the Womb to Adulthood: Suggestions for a Paradigm Shift;10.3390/jpm11020070;The wide spectrum of unique needs and strengths of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a challenge for the worldwide healthcare system. With the plethora of information from research, a common thread is required to conceptualize an exhaustive pathogenetic paradigm. The epidemiological and clinical findings in ASD cannot be explained by the traditional linear genetic model, hence the need to move towards a more fluid conception, integrating genetics, environment, and epigenetics as a whole. The embryo-fetal period and the first two years of life (the so-called ‘First 1000 Days’) are the crucial time window for neurodevelopment. In particular, the interplay and the vicious loop between immune activation, gut dysbiosis, and mitochondrial impairment/oxidative stress significantly affects neurodevelopment during pregnancy and undermines the health of ASD people throughout life. Consequently, the most effective intervention in ASD is expected by primary prevention aimed at pregnancy and at early control of the main effector molecular pathways. We will reason here on a comprehensive and exhaustive pathogenetic paradigm in ASD, viewed not just as a theoretical issue, but as a tool to provide suggestions for effective preventive strategies and personalized, dynamic (from womb to adulthood), systemic, and interdisciplinary healthcare approach.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504019/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11020070";25/1/2021;Autism Spectrum Disorders;0.9757
1873;P122 The Diagnosis and Management of Appendicitis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Pennine Acute Trust Experience;10.1093/bjsopen/zrab032.121;INTRODUCTION: Appendicitis management has evolved recently with more reliance on Computed Topography (CT) and laparoscopic surgery being commonplace. In this project we looked at how the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) had impacted the diagnosis, management and outcomes of patients with appendicitis in our unit. METHOD: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with appendicitis from 1st March – 30th April in 2019 and 2020. Data was collected on diagnosis, management and outcomes. RESULTS: In 2020, 91 patients were identified (mean 33, range 6-85, F:M 1:1.4). In 2019, 107 patients were identified (mean 32, range 7-69, M:F 1:1.1). There was no significant difference in patients’ symptom duration (p = 0.21), White Cell Count (p = 0.20) or C-Reactive Protein (p = 0.10). More CTs were performed in 2020 (56/91, 61.5%) than in 2019 (40/107, 37.4%). Less patients underwent appendicectomy in 2020 (75/91, 82.4%) than in 2019 (104/107, 97.2%). Open appendicectomies were performed in 64% (48/75) of those operated in 2020 compared with 12.2% (13/104) in 2019. There was no difference in hospital length of stay or re-admissions rates. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis and management of appendicitis changed considerably at our trust during COVID-19 with more reliance on CT diagnosis and less use of laparoscopy. Despite this, outcomes remained unchanged.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083531/;8/4/2021;Coronavirus pandemic;0.926
1874;Graduate nursing student stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic.;10.1016/j.profnurs.2021.04.008;BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly impacted graduate nursing students at work, home, and school. Stress can influence the ability to focus, study, and may delay continuation in graduate school. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to identify the stressors of graduate nursing students during the pandemic. METHOD A prospective, descriptive, online survey design was used to identify graduate nursing student stressors during the pandemic at one educational institution in the United States. Questions related to employment, COVID-19 exposure, institutional support, future graduate plans were summarized for the total sample and stratified by program (MS, DNP, PhD). Changes in a total stress score were evaluated pre and post onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS A total of 222 graduate nursing students completed the survey. The vast majority of students were employed before the pandemic and a significant decrease in employment occurred during the pandemic (97.3% to 90.1%, p < .001). Overall stress increased (p < .001). The increased total stress was associated with students participating in clinical rotations (q = 0.024) and having a change in work hours (q = 0.022).

1875;Quantitative acoustic metrics of vowel production in mandarin-speakers with post-stroke spastic dysarthria.;10.1080/02699206.2020.1827295;Impairment of vowel production in dysarthria has been highly valued. This study aimed to explore the vowel production of Mandarin-speakers with post-stroke spastic dysarthria in connected speech and to explore the influence of gender and tone on the vowel production. Multiple vowel acoustic metrics, including F1 range, F2 range, vowel space area (VSA), vowel articulation index (VAI) and formant centralization ratio (FCR), were analyzed from vowel tokens embedded in connected speech produced. The participants included 25 clients with spastic dysarthria secondary to stroke (15 males, 10 females) and 25 speakers with no history of neurological disease (15 males, 10 females). Variance analyses were conducted and the results showed that the main effects of population, gender, and tone on F2 range, VSA, VAI, and FCR were all significant. Vowel production became centralized in the clients with post-stroke spastic dysarthria. Vowel production was found to be more centralized in males compared to females. Vowels in neutral tone (T0) were the most centralized among the other tones. The quantitative acoustic metrics of F2 range, VSA, VAI, and FCR were effective in predicting vowel production in Mandarin-speaking clients with post-stroke spastic dysarthria, and hence may be used as powerful tools to assess the speech performance for this population.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/02699206.2020.1827295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985269/";28/9/2020;formant centralization ratio;0.9003
1876;Comprehensive Survey of Using Machine Learning in the COVID-19 Pandemic.;10.3390/diagnostics11071155;"Since December 2019, the global health population has faced the rapid spreading of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). With the incremental acceleration of the number of infected cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported COVID-19 as an epidemic that puts a heavy burden on healthcare sectors in almost every country. The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in this context is difficult to ignore. AI companies have been racing to develop innovative tools that contribute to arm the world against this pandemic and minimize the disruption that it may cause. The main objective of this study is to survey the decisive role of AI as a technology used to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Five significant applications of AI for COVID-19 were found, including (1) COVID-19 diagnosis using various data types (e.g., images, sound, and text); (2) estimation of the possible future spread of the disease based on the current confirmed cases; (3) association between COVID-19 infection and patient characteristics; (4) vaccine development and drug interaction; and (5) development of supporting applications.

While emerging studies examined birth outcomes in COVID-19 positive women, knowledge of the psychological experience of childbirth and maternal wellness remains lacking. This matched-control survey-based study included a sample of women recruited during the first wave of the pandemic in the US who gave birth in the previous six months. Women reporting confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (n = 68) during pregnancy or childbirth were matched on background factors with women reporting COVID-19 negativity (n = 2,276). We found nearly 50% of COVID positive women endorsed acute traumatic stress symptoms at a clinical level in response to childbirth. This group was more than twice as likely to endorse acute stress and to have no visitors during maternity hospitalization than COVID negative women; they were also less likely to room-in with newborns. The COVID positive group reported higher levels of pain in delivery, lower newborn weights, and more infant admission to neonatal intensive care units.

1878;Emerging roles of extracellular vesicles in COVID-19, a double-edged sword?;10.1111/imm.13329;The sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infected disease (COVID-19), initiated from Wuhan, China, has rapidly grown into a global pandemic. Emerging evidence has implicated extracellular vesicles (EVs), a key intercellular communicator, in the pathogenesis and treatment of COVID-19. In the pathogenesis of COVID-19, cells that express ACE2 and CD9 can transfer these viral receptors to other cells via EVs, making recipient cells more susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Once infected, cells release EVs packaged with viral particles that further facilitate viral spreading and immune evasion, aggravating COVID-19 and its complications. In contrast, EVs derived from stem cells, especially mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, alleviate severe inflammation (cytokine storm) and repair damaged lung cells in COVID-19 by delivery of anti-inflammatory molecules. These therapeutic beneficial EVs can also be engineered to function as a drug delivery platform or vaccine to fight against COVID-19. Therefore, EVs from diverse sources exhibit distinct effects in regulating viral infection, immune response, and tissue damage/repair, functioning as a double-edged sword in COVID-19. Here, we summarize the recent progress in understanding the pathological roles of EVs in COVID-19. A comprehensive discussion of the therapeutic effects/potentials of EVs is also provided.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33742451/";19/3/2021;SARS-CoV-2 infected disease;0.9344
1879;Digital Health in Cardiac Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention: A Search for the Ideal Tool;10.3390/s21010012;Digital health is becoming more integrated in daily medical practice. In cardiology, patient care is already moving from the hospital to the patients’ homes, with large trials showing positive results in the field of telemonitoring via cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure via implantable devices, telemonitoring via home-based non-invasive sensors, and screening for atrial fibrillation via smartphone and smartwatch technology. Cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention are modalities that could greatly benefit from digital health integration, as current compliance and cardiac rehabilitation participation rates are low and optimisation is urgently required. This viewpoint offers a perspective on current use of digital health technologies in cardiac rehabilitation, heart failure and secondary prevention. Important barriers which need to be addressed for implementation in medical practice are discussed. To conclude, a future ideal digital tool and integrated healthcare system are envisioned. To overcome personal, technological, and legal barriers, technological development should happen in dialog with patients and caregivers.

1880;Surgical Grade and Repeat Laser Peripheral Iridotomy Procedures with Risk Stratification and Educational Considerations;10.2147/opth.s283370;BACKGROUND/AIMS: Peripheral laser iridotomy (PLI) is a commonly performed procedure. While effective, repeat procedures (RPs) may be required for a variety of causes. We report the causes and rate of RP PLI and whether surgical grade is a risk factor. METHODS: Two years of retrospective data from 282 patients who had undergone PLI at a single UK ophthalmology department were retrieved using an electronic medical record system (Medisoft, Leeds, UK). RESULTS: A total of 253 patients underwent analysis with 20 requiring RPs. Our data identified a correlation between experience of the operating surgeon and an increase in RP rate, with statistical significance (p=0.036) observed between consultants and registrars. No other statistically significant risk factors were identified from our study. Prescriber preference for iopidine was observed. From our findings and the current literature, prognostic factors that appear to influence RP rate include surgical grade, patient compliance, Asian ethnicity, and anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: RP rate increases in PLI when a junior surgeon is performing the procedure, and thus cases with established prognostic factors for RPs should have senior input. Formal and standardized YAG-laser training should be implemented alongside risk stratification of patients to improve both trainee education and patient care.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33335384/; https://doi.org/10.2147/opth.s283370";8/12/2020;Peripheral laser iridotomy;0.9153
1881;Displacements in the Philippines in a Post-COVID-19 World: A Recovery Focus;10.1093/rsq/hdaa026;Millions of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Philippines experience human rights issues during their displacement. Their rights and access to basic life-saving services are impacted by their forced movement and its resulting, often prolonged, displacement. Durable solutions are also less prioritised in displacement management. Though a legal framework on disaster governance exists, it lacked a human rights perspective that could integrate human rights standards into humanitarian support. With the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spreading in the country, IDPs are at a higher risk of contracting the disease due to inadequate shelter conditions. As the government battles both the spread of the virus and the need to restart the economy in a post-COVID-19 pandemic scenario, IDPs must be included in the national and local frameworks for recovery. This article discusses the situation of IDPs in the Philippines and looks into the policy gaps that limit opportunities for effective displacement management. It also surfaces human rights issues that must be addressed by the government in its socio-economic revival agenda and discusses the accountability of state actors in providing opportunities for IDPs to achieve durable solutions. The article also establishes the need for an IDP law in institutionalising protection for IDPs post-COVID-19.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928584/;7/1/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9797

Evidence in the form of randomized-controlled trials and cohort studies continues to build support for the use of CGM during pregnancy to improve measures of maternal glycemia as well as obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Based on data from the CGM in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (CONCEPTT) trial alongside a Swedish cohort study of real-world outcomes of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines now recommend that real-time CGM be offered to all pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. Based on these guidelines, all pregnant individuals in the United Kingdom with type 1 diabetes will receive government-funded real-time CGM for a 12-month duration. These guidelines are a game-changer and will continue to facilitate more widespread access to CGM use in the United Kingdom and beyond.

As stroke is an aging-related disease, in this work, we attempt to examine the role and potential mechanism of Sirt3 in regulating ischemic stroke by using a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model in wild type (WT) and Sirt3 knockout (KO) mice, coupled with oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) experiments in cultured primary astrocytes. Sirt3 deficiency aggravated neuronal cell apoptosis and neurological deficits after brain ischemia. In addition, Sirt3 KO mice showed more severe blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory responses compared with WT group in the acute phase. Furthermore, specific overexpression of Sirt3 in astrocytes by injecting glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)::Sirt3 virus in ischemic region showed protective effect against stroke-induced damage. Mechanistically, Sirt3 could regulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by inhibiting hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling after ischemia (OGD). Our results have shown that Sirt3 plays a protective role in ischemic stroke via regulating HIF-1α/VEGF signaling in astrocytes, and reversal of the Sirt3 expression at the acute phase could be a worthy direction for stroke therapy.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-020-00889-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32500353/";4/6/2020;oxygen glucose deprivation;0.9714

Data provided in this study supports the utility of a newly-designed lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. We employed a clinical cohort of 1,892 SARS-CoV-2 patients and controls, including individuals diagnosed by RT-qPCR at Yale New Haven Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Hefei City (Hefei CDC), Anhui Province (Anhui Province CDC), and Fuyang City (Fuyang CDC). The LFA studied here detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies with a specificity of 97.9-100% for IgM, 99.7-100% for IgG, and sensitivities ranging from 94.1-100% for patients >14-days post symptom onset. Sensitivity decreases in patients <14-days post symptom onset, which is likely due to lower IgG/IgM antibody levels in this population. Finally, we developed a visual intensity reporting system that we believe will be suitable for laboratory and point-of-care settings, and will provide granular information about antibody levels. Overall our results support the widespread utility of this and other LFAs in assessing population-level epidemiological statistics.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.25.20112227; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.25.20112227v1?rss=1";26/5/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9681

By developing a simulation framework that models population dynamics and the interactions of both humans and mosquitoes, we may enable epidemiologists to analyze and forecast the transmission and spread of an infectious disease in specific areas. We extend the traditional SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) mathematical model and propose an Agent-based model to analyze the interactions between the host and the vector using: (i) our proposed algorithm to compute vector density, based on the reproductive behavior of the vector; and (ii) agent interactions to simulate transmission of virus in a spatio-temporal environment, and forecast the spread of the disease in a given area over a period of time. Our simulation results identify several expected dengue cases and their direction of spread, which can help in detecting epidemic outbreaks. Our proposed framework provides visualization and forecasting capabilities to study the epidemiology of a certain region and aid public health departments in emergency preparedness.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304008/;22/5/2020;Vector-borne diseases;0.9784
1886;Functional Respiratory Evaluation in the COVID-19 Era: The Role of Pulmonary Function Test Laboratories.;10.24875/ric.20000250;"The pandemic character of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) requires strategy changes designed to guarantee the safety of patients and health-care professionals. We are greatly concerned by the limitations in the operation of pulmonary function test (PFT) laboratories, since there is a high risk of disease progression in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, and we are now faced by the influx of a new group of individuals in the recovery phase of post-COVID-19-syndrome that requires evaluation and follow-up of their respiratory function. To reestablish the operation of PFT laboratories limiting the risk of cross-contamination, we herein present the consensus reached by a group of experts in respiratory physiology, most of whom work in PFT laboratories in several Latin American countries, on the applicable recommendations for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia survivors when undergoing PFT. We present the safety and hygiene measures that must be adopted in laboratories or centers where PFT is conducted in adults and/or children. These recommendations answer the following questions: which PFT is most recommended in subjects that have recovered from COVID-19; what quality control and safety measures should PFT laboratories implement during this pandemic?

1887;Hand-assisted Laparoscopic Repeat Hepatectomy for Secondary Liver Neoplasm.;10.1097/sle.0000000000000760;BACKGROUND Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery is a widely accepted alternative to an open approach. The use of this technique in repeat liver resection is limited due to technical difficulties caused by postsurgical adhesions. We aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of hand-assisted laparoscopic repeat hepatectomy (HALRH). MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective study of the medical files of patients who had undergone HALRH between 2010 and 2017 in 2 university-affiliated medical centers. RESULTS Sixteen patients with repeat hepatectomy were included with a median age of 67.5 years. The first liver resection was a traditional laparotomy for 9 patients and hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery for 7 patients. The conversion rate to open surgery was 6%. The median operative time, blood loss during surgery, and postoperative hospital stay were 166 minutes, 400 mL, and 7 days, respectively. R0 resections were achieved in 88% of patients. The median number of tumors and tumor size were 1 and of 25 mm, respectively. There were no mortalities or major complications postoperatively. For patients with colorectal liver metastases, the median follow-up and overall survival were 21 and 43 months, respectively. CONCLUSION The findings suggest HALRH to be safe and feasible. Future ERAS guidelines should evaluate this approach for liver surgery.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31985572/";23/1/2020;Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery;0.963
1888;A national survey of workplace-related musculoskeletal disorder and ergonomic practices amongst Irish otolaryngologists;10.1007/s11845-021-02642-y;BACKGROUND: Work-related musculoskeletal disorder (WRMD) is a rising concern for surgeons, particularly those involved in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Severe WRMD can adversely affect surgeon’s health and foreshorten their careers if not appropriately managed. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of WRMD among Irish otolaryngologists and determine their knowledge of the best ergonomic principles. METHODS: A national survey was distributed electronically to all otolaryngology consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) in Ireland. The survey assessed respondents’ age, grade, history of WRMD, and treatments sought for WRMD and knowledge of best ergonomic practice. RESULTS: Forty-nine of one hundred and two respondents completed the survey. The lifetime prevalence of WRMD among this cohort was 75.5%. Pain was the most commonly experienced symptom at 71.4%. The neck was the most frequently affected location (59.2%). Treatment for WRMD was sought by 36.7% of participants. The majority of respondents (73.5%) were unaware of recommendations made in the field of surgical ergonomics, while 85.7% were interested in learning ergonomic principles. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a high prevalence of WRMD amongst otolaryngologists working in Ireland and demonstrates a need for ergonomic training for surgeons.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02642-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963514/";8/5/2021;Work-related musculoskeletal disorder;0.9586
1889;Nonspecific blood tests as proxies for COVID-19 hospitalization: are there plausible associations after excluding noisy predictors?;10.1101/2020.10.12.20211557;"This study applied causal criteria in directed acyclic graphs for handling covariates in associations for prognosis of severe COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 19) cases. To identify nonspecific blood tests and risk factors as predictors of hospitalization due to COVID-19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by comparing the concordance statistics (AUC) for positive and negative cases of SARS-CoV-2 (acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be either controlled for their confounders or eliminated (when confounders are unavailable). Models were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata. The framework was applied to an open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) exam. C-reactive Protein (CRP) was a noisy predictor: hospitalization could have happen due to causes other than COVID-19 even when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild. Candidates of characteristic response from moderate to severe inflammation of COVID-19 were: combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor; and creatinine, as risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils, and age.";"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.12.20211557; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211557v1?rss=1";14/10/2020;Corona virus disease 19;0.9022

Study Design and Methods: The study was designed as a diagnostic test. Having qualified patients for the study, an ultrasound examination was performed, consistent with a predetermined protocol, and employing convex and linear transducers. We investigated the possibility of B-line artifact conversion depending on the set frequency (2 MHz and 6 MHz), and examined pleural line abnormalities. Results: The study group comprised 32 patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) (and fibrosis) and 30 patients with pulmonary edema. In total, 1941 cineloops were obtained from both groups and analyzed. The employment of both types of transducers (linear and convex) was most effective (specificity 91%, specificity 97%, positive predictive value (PPV) 97%, negative predictive value (NPV) 91%, LR(+) 27,19, LR(−) 0.097, area under curve (AUC) = 0.936, p = 7 × 10(−6)). Interpretation: The best accuracy in differentiating the etiology of B-line artifacts was obtained with the use of both types of transducers (linear and convex), complemented with the observation of the conversion of B-line artifacts to Z-line.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996921/;26/2/2021;interstitial lung disease;0.976

The revolution in the use of the mobile phone (~80%) by the majority of people in Bangladesh in recent years has created an opportunity to improve the overall scenario in the treatment or remote monitoring process for children with ASD. In this grant project, we planned and developed a mobile phone-based system to remotely monitor children with ASD and help their treatment process both at the caregiver and care practitioner ends. In developing mCARE, we utilized a Remote Experience Sampling Method to design, build, deploy, and study the impact of mobile based monitoring and treatment of children with ASD in Bangladesh. We developed a mobile application using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). A caregiver routinely reported the behavioral and milestone parameters of their children with ASD. The care practitioners monitored the longitudinal data that helped them in decision-making in a particular patient’s treatment process. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) was used to make this mobile application more user friendly with consideration of the local economic, social, and cultural values in Bangladesh.;"https://doi.org/10.20900/jpbs.20210004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791439/";26/2/2021;Autism Spectrum Disorder;0.9835

Instrumental seismicity suffers of the poor coverage of the seismic stations of the RSN (National Seismic Network). To improve the seismological monitoring of the area, in 2013 the OTRIONS seismic network (OSN), managed by the University of Bari - Italy, in cooperation with INGV (National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology), was installed. In this study, focal mechanisms of single and composite events have been computed using 118 micro-earthquakes occurred in this area. We subdivided the dataset into subsets according to their location and depth, distinguishing between the Promontory zone and the Apulian foredeep. High quality focal mechanisms and low-misfit stress tensor inversion were obtained for three groups of events. To better constrain the stress tensor we included also focal mechanism solutions obtained in previous studies. In the southwestern Apulian foredeep zone, a normal fault kinematics is inferred, normal to the Apennine stress direction; in the Promontory zone, the fault kinematics indicate inverse fault mechanisms striking in NE-SW direction.

1893;341 The Diagnosis and Management of Appendicitis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Pennine Acute Trust Experience;10.1093/bjs/znab134.055;INTRODUCTION: Appendicitis management has evolved recently with more reliance on Computed Topography (CT) and laparoscopic surgery being commonplace. In this project we looked at how the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) had impacted the diagnosis, management and outcomes of patients with appendicitis in our unit. METHOD: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with appendicitis from 1(st) March – 30(th) April in 2019 and 2020. Data was collected on diagnosis, management and outcomes. RESULTS: In 2020, 91 patients were identified (mean 33, range 6-85, F:M 1:1.4). In 2019, 107 patients were identified (mean 32, range 7-69, M:F 1:1.1). There was no significant difference in patients’ symptom duration (p = 0.21), White Cell Count (p = 0.20) or C-Reactive Protein (p = 0.10). More CTs were performed in 2020 (56/91, 61.5%) than in 2019 (40/107, 37.4%). Less patients underwent appendicectomy in 2020 (75/91, 82.4%) than in 2019 (104/107, 97.2%). Open appendicectomies were performed in 64% (48/75) of those operated in 2020 compared with 12.2% (13/104) in 2019. There was no difference in hospital length of stay or re-admissions rates. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis and management of appendicitis changed considerably at our trust during COVID-19 with more reliance on CT diagnosis and less use of laparoscopy. Despite this, outcomes remained unchanged.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135781/;4/5/2021;Coronavirus pandemic;0.933
1894;Local Government Approaches to Combating COVID-19 Inequities: A Durham County Department of Public Health Perspective.;10.3390/ijerph18126544;When a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) made major headlines in 2020, it further exposed an existing public health crisis related to inequities within our communities and health care delivery system. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, populations of color had higher infection and mortality rates, and even experienced greater disease severity compared to whites. Populations of color often bear the brunt of COVID-19 and other health inequities, due to the multifaceted relationship between systemic racism and the social determinants of health. As this relationship continues to perpetuate health inequities, the local health department is an agency that has the jurisdiction and responsibility to prevent disease and protect the health of the communities they serve. When equity is integrated into a health department's operational infrastructure as a disease prevention strategy, it can elevate the agency's response to public health emergencies. Collecting, reporting, and tracking demographic data that is necessary to identify inequities becomes a priority to facilitate a more robust public health response. The purpose of this paper is to present strategies of how a local health department operationalized equity in various stages of COVID-19 response and apply these methods to future public health emergencies to better serve vulnerable communities.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206993/";18/6/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9418

One of the plant medicines from TAM used in this protocol is purgahuasca. It is a decoction of the vine Banisteriopsis caapi alone, whose use is traditional among the Awajún and other ethnic groups in Peru. The research began with a field trip to Awajún territory to explore the indigenous use of purgahuasca as an initiation rite. Then, analysis of its application was conducted in the clinical context of Takiwasi. Open-ended and semi-structured interviews with Awajún informants and Takiwasi's therapeutic staff were performed and analyzed following the narrative methodological approach. Further clinical data on the ingestion of purgahuasca by Takiwasi's SUD patients were obtained from the internal repository. These indicate that 359 (92.1%) patients reported having had the so-called mareación (dizziness), 299 (76.7%) experienced physical sensations, and 208 (53.3%) had visions. These effects can be related to the psychoactivity of β-Carbolines alkaloids from B. caapi, a medicinal plant that seems to have potential benefits also for SUD, especially giving a key contribution to the patients' therapeutic process of becoming aware of the personal reasons behind addictive behaviors.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2020.1820641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985365/";27/9/2020;Substance Use Disorders;0.9926
1897;Diving after SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection: Fitness to dive assessment and medical guidance.;10.28920/dhm50.3.278-287;Scuba diving is a critical activity for commercial industry, military activities, research, and public safety, as well as a passion for many recreational divers. Physicians are expected to provide return-to-diving recommendations after SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection based upon the best available evidence, often drawn from experience with other, similar diseases. Scuba diving presents unique physiologic challenges to the body secondary to immersion, increased pressure and increased work of breathing. The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 are still unknown, but if they are proven to be similar to other coronaviruses (such as Middle East respiratory syndrome or SARS-CoV-1) they may result in long-term pulmonary and cardiac sequelae that impact divers' ability to safely return to scuba diving. This review considers available literature and the pathophysiology of COVID-19 as it relates to diving fitness, including current recommendations for similar illnesses, and proposes guidelines for evaluation of divers after COVID-19. The guidelines are based upon best available evidence about COVID-19, as well as past experience with determination of diving fitness.

The cytokine storm can occur in a number of infectious and noninfectious diseases including COVID-19, sepsis, ebola, avian influenza, and graft versus host disease, or during the severe inflammatory response syndrome.Area covered: This review mainly focuses on the most common and well-known methods of protein studies (PAGE, SDS-PAGE, and high- performance liquid chromatography). It also discusses other modern technologies in proteomics like mass spectrometry, soft ionization techniques, cytometric bead assays, and the next generation of microarrays that have been used to get an in-depth understanding of the pathomechanisms involved during the cytokine storm.Expert opinion: Overactivation of leukocytes drives the production and secretion of inflammatory cytokines fueling the cytokine storm. These events lead to a systemic hyper-inflammation, circulatory collapse and shock, and finally to multiorgan failure. Therefore, monitoring the patient's systemic cytokine levels with proteomic technologies that are redundant, economical, and require minimal sample volume for real-time assessment might help in a better clinical evaluation and management of critically ill patients.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/14789450.2021.1911652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849358/";14/4/2021;19;0.9215

He suffered from epigastralgia for a month and then visited our hospital with complaints of severe epigastralgia and hematemesis. A physical examination revealed abdominal distension without rigidity. Laboratory data showed severe systemic inflammation, multiple organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Computed tomography showed multifocal thickness of the gastroduodenal wall with surrounding panniculitis, gas in a portal vein and a perigastric vein. Emergency esophago-gastro duodenoscopy (EGD) demonstrated a large erosion in the antrum of the stomach, and penetration surrounded by circumferentially ischemic mucosa in the second and third portions of the duodenum.

The complications derived from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vary due to comorbidities, sex and age, with more than 50% of the patients requiring some level of intensive care developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The authors carried out an extensive and comprehensive literature review on SARS-CoV-2 infection, the clinical, pathological and radiological presentation as well as the current treatment strategies. AREAS COVERED Various complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified, the most lethal being the acute respiratory distress syndrome, caused most likely by the presence of severe immune cell response and the concomitant alveolus inflammation. The new treatment strategies are updated, and the analysis of the physiopathology is included in this review. EXPERT OPINION ARDS is one of the most frequent complications in patients with COVID-19. Information regarding the etiology and physiopathology are still unfolding and for the prevention and amelioration, good clinical management, adequate ventilatory support and the use of systemic corticoids seem to be the most efficient way to reduce mortality and to reduce hospital lengths.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2020.1820329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32902367/";9/9/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9224

In this study, a duplex SYBR Green I-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was established for the rapid, simultaneous detection of CaCV and CaAstV. Two pairs of specific primers were designed based on the Rep gene of CaCV and the Cap gene of CaAstV. By using the real-time PCR assay method, the two viruses can be distinguished by the difference in melting temperatures, 79 °C and 86 °C for CaCV and CaAstV, respectively. This assay had high specificity, showing no cross-reaction with other common canine viruses, as well as high sensitivity, with minimum detection limits of 9.25 × 10(1) copies/μL and 6.15 × 10(1) copies/μL for CaCV and CaAstV, respectively. Based on the mean coefficient of variation, the method had good reproducibility and reliability. In a clinical test of 57 fecal samples, the rates of positive detection by real-time PCR were 14.04% (8/57) and 12.28% (7/57) for CaCV and CaAstV, respectively, and the rate of co-infection was 8.77% (5/57). In conclusion, the newly established duplex SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR assay is sensitive, specific, reliable, and rapid and is an effective tool for the detection of co-infections with CaCV and CaAstV.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32919029/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850820304229?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850820304229; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2020.101666";10/9/2020;reliability;0.9131

Especially, this study provides insights of the fundamentals of the factors that may affect the spread of the infection in cities, where the marginal effects of some most influential factors to the virus transmission are estimated. It reveals that the distance to epicenter is a very strong influential factor, and is negatively linked with the spread of COVID-19. In addition, subway, wastewater and residential garbage are positively connected with the virus transmission. Moreover, both urban area and population density are negatively associated with the spread of COVID-19 at the early stage of the epidemic. Furthermore, this study also provides high precision estimation of the number of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan city, which is the epicenter of the outbreak in China. Based on the real-world data of cities outside Wuhan on March 2, 2020, the estimated number is 56,944.866 (mean value), which is very close to the officially reported number. The methodology and main conclusions shown in this paper are of general interest, and they can be applied to other countries to help understand the local transmission of COVID-19 as well.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026427512030531X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2020.102759; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S026427512030531X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501355/";1/5/2020;coronavirus;0.9004
1905;Measles outbreak during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico.;10.24875/bmhim.20000173;"Measles is an exanthematous disease caused by a virus of the Morbillivirus genus. On February 23, 2020, the exanthema began in the first confirmed case of measles this year. At the same time, on February 28, 2020, the first case of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was confirmed. Up to June 6, 2020, 176 measles cases have been confirmed: 137 in Mexico City, 37 in the state of Mexico, and two in the state of Campeche. In Mexico City, municipalities with more cases were Gustavo A. Madero, Miguel Hidalgo, and Iztapalapa; in the State of Mexico were Ecatepec, Tlalnepantla, and Netzahualcoyotl; in Campeche, there are only two cases reported. On the other hand, 7,065,133 cases of COVID-19 have been registered worldwide with a global case fatality rate of 5.7%. In Mexico, there have been 113,619 confirmed cases and 13,511 deaths, while in Mexico City, there have been 30,223 cases and 3062 deaths. Iztapalapa and Gustavo A. Madero are the locations with more cases reported. Hence, a campaign of social distancing started as part of the strategies to control the spread of the infection. The potential threat is that as social confinement measures are relaxed and mobility is initiated, both viruses could continue to spread.

1906;Deep learning Enables Accurate Diagnosis of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) with CT images.;10.1109/tcbb.2021.3065361;A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged recently as an acute respiratory syndrome. The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. A deep learning-based CT diagnosis system was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from the healthy with an AUC of 0.99, recall (sensitivity) of 0.93, and precision of 0.96. When integrating three types of CT images, our model achieved a recall of 0.93 with precision of 0.86 for discriminating COVID-19 patients from others. Moreover, our model could extract main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is visually helpful for assisted diagnoses by doctors.

1907;Technological exaptation and crisis management: Evidence from COVID‐19 outbreaks;10.1111/radm.12455;One of the key issues in the field of technology analysis and innovation management is how new technologies origin and evolve in the presence of environmental threats. We confront this problem focusing on emerging innovative solutions to cope with unexpected and harmful problems posed by crises and needing a rapid, effective response. We specifically analyze the patterns of critical innovations to cope with new coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) that is generating public health and economic issues worldwide. Accordingly, in the context of the theory of technological exaptation, we adopted a narrative approach examining vital innovations that ended up treating COVID‐19 even though they were originated to treat other diseases (more or less distant from the COVID‐19 domain), as the antiviral drug Remdesivir and the antirheumatoid arthritis drug Tocilizumab. Results reveal that technological exaptation, especially if characterized by a longer exaptive distance, is a potential driving force of innovation to cope with COVID‐19 in the short‐term and other similar issues. On this basis, we provide propositions for a more general crisis model of innovation. This study adds a new perspective that may be helpful to explain the evolution of innovation in the presence of crises, considering technological exaptation in a context of environmental threats.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8013845/;2/2/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9126
1908;"rcent agreement; NPA: negative percent agreeRapid identification of bacteria from respiratory samples of patients hospitalized in intensive care units, with FilmArray Pneumonia Panel Plus.";10.1016/j.ijid.2021.05.074;OBJECTIVES We evaluated the performance of FilmArray Pneumonia Panel Plus (FA-PP) for detecting typical bacterial pathogens in respiratory specimens from patients hospitalized in the ICU. METHODS We implemented FA-PP for clinical use in the microbiology laboratory in March 2020. We performed a retrospective analysis on a consecutive cohort of adult patient hospitalized in ICUs between March 2020 and May 2020. The respiratory specimens included sputum, blind bronchoalveolar lavage (BBAL) and protected specimen brush (PSB). We performed conventional culture and FA-PP in parallel. RESULTS We analyzed 147 samples from 92 patients (88% had COVID-19). At least one pathogen was detected in 46% (68/147) of samples by FA-PP, and 39% (57/147) of samples by culture. The overall percent agreement between FA-PP and culture results was 98% (93-100%). Bacteria with semi-quantitative FA-PP results ≥ 105 copies/mL for PSB, ≥ 106 copies/mL for BBAL and ≥ 107 copies/mL for sputa, reached clinically significant thresholds for growth in 90%, 100% and 91% of cultures, respectively. FA-PP detected resistance markers, including mecA/C, blaCTX-M and blaVIM. Median turnaround time was significantly shorter for FA-PP than for culture. CONCLUSIONS FA-PP may therefore constitute a faster approach to the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia in patients hospitalized in ICUs.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.05.074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34087488/";1/6/2021;88%;0.9704

Data on the clinical course of COVID‐19 in immunosuppressed patients are limited and the effective treatment strategy for these patients is unknown. METHODS: We describe our institutional experience with COVID‐19 in SOT. Demographic, clinical and treatment data were extracted from the electronic patient files. RESULTS: A total of 23 SOT transplant recipients suffering from COVID‐19 were identified (n = 3 heart; n =15 kidney; n = 1 kidney‐after‐heart; n = 3 lung and n = 1 liver transplant recipient). The presenting symptoms were similar to non‐immunocompromised patients Eighty‐three percent (19/23) of the patients required hospitalization but only two of these were transferred to the intensive care unit. Five patients died from COVID‐19; all had high Clinical Frailty scores. In four of these patients, mechanical ventilation was deemed futile. In 57% of patients, the immunosuppressive therapy was not changed and only 3 patients were treated with chloroquine. Most patients recovered without experimental anti‐viral therapy.

1910;Building stock market resilience through digital transformation: using Google trends to analyze the impact of COVID-19 pandemic;10.1186/s11782-020-00089-z;As the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic rages globally, its impact has been felt in the stock markets around the world. Amidst the gloomy economic outlook, certain sectors seem to have survived better than others. This paper aims to investigate the sectors that have performed better even as market sentiment is affected by the pandemic. The daily closing stock prices of a total usable sample of 1,567 firms from 37 sectors are first analyzed using a combination of hierarchical clustering and shape-based distance (SBD) measures. Market sentiment is modeled from Google Trends on the COVID-19 pandemic. This is then analyzed against the time series of daily closing stock prices using augmented vector autoregression (VAR). The empirical results indicate that market sentiment towards the pandemic has significant effects on the stock prices of the sectors. Particularly, the stock price performance across sectors is differentiated by the level of the digital transformation of sectors, with those that are most digitally transformed, showing resilience towards negative market sentiment on the pandemic. This study contributes to the existing literature by incorporating search trends to analyze market sentiment, and by showing that digital transformation moderated the stock market resilience of firms against concern over the COVID-19 outbreak.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7502306/;21/9/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9701
1911;Pneumothorax with bullous lesions as a late complication of COVID-19 pneumonia - a report on two clinical cases;10.1016/j.jemermed.2021.04.030;Background: Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is mainly affecting the respiratory tract, causing viral pneumonia with fever, hypoxemia, and cough. Commonly observed complications include acute respiratory failure, liver or kidney injury, and cardiovascular or neurologic symptoms. In some patients, inflammatory damage results in long term complications like pulmonary fibrosis, chronic pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy, or neurologic symptoms. The developement of spontaneous pneumothorax is reported as a rare complication mainly in consequence to mechanic ventilation in the criticall ill. Case Report: We report on two cases of COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by a spontaneous pneumothorax and bullous lesions of the lung. Bilateral giant bullae were observed in one of the cases. This complication occurred after an initial resolvement of respiratory symptoms (day 16 and day 29 after COVID-19 treatment was started). Initially, both patients had shown a rather mild course of COVID-19 pneumonia and no mechanical ventilatory support had been necessary. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? In both cases, COVID-19 caused alveolar damage and formation of thoracic bullae with consequent spontaneous pneumothorax as a serious complication.

Schools and universities provide rich resources for adolescents and young adults to develop significant coping mechanisms. AIM This study assessed the perceptions of risk, fear, mental health status, and coping strategies among Saudi student nurses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Using an online survey, the mental health of the students was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale short form version, whereas the coping was assessed by the Brief-Coping Orientation of Problem Experienced scale. RESULTS The students had modest risk perception and fear of contracting COVID-19. ""Religion"" was reported as the most frequently used coping strategy. Approximately 43.3%, 37.2%, and 30.9% of the respondents manifested some degree of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Poor COVID-19 knowledge, perceived seriousness of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, and the use of some coping strategies were predictors of fear. Knowing someone infected with COVID-19, fear, and several coping strategies predicted students' mental health.

1913;Incidental diagnosis of situs inversus totalis: a perspective from an emergency department attendance.;10.1136/bcr-2021-242337;A 30-year-old man of African origin presented to our emergency department (ED) with subjective fever and abdominal pain which started on the day of attendance. Vital signs and systemical examination were within normal limits. As part of his evaluation in ED, a 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed which showed features consistent with dextrocardia later confirmed on a chest X-ray as well. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen was performed which showed mirror imaging of the abdominal viscera, all of which were otherwise structurally normal. A diagnosis of situs inversus totalis was made. The patient's symptoms resolved with analgesia and he was discharged with advice to follow-up in our hospital's outpatient department. The diagnosis of situs inversus in the ED is a tricky one to make and most cases of this condition are discovered incidentally, as in our case. The mirror-imaged arrangement of viscera can have implications on the site of localised complaints, the physical examination, future health problems for the patient including anaesthesia risks, chronic lung conditions, cardiac complications and specialised trauma management. This anatomical variation can pose diagnostic challenges in such patients. Based on meticulous examination and readily accessible investigations including X-rays, 12-lead ECG and ultrasound, a timely diagnosis can be made.;"https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-242337; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837038/";9/4/2021;emergency department;0.9483
1914;Asthma in Adult Patients with COVID-19. Prevalence and Risk of Severe Disease;10.1164/rccm.202008-3266oc;Rationale: Health outcomes of people with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) range from no symptoms to severe illness and death. Asthma, a common chronic lung disease, has been considered likely to increase the severity of COVID-19, although data addressing this hypothesis have been scarce until very recently. Objectives: To review the epidemiologic literature related to asthma’s potential role in COVID-19 severity. Methods: Studies were identified through the PubMed (MEDLINE) and medRxiv (preprint) databases using the search terms “asthma,” “SARS-CoV-2” (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), and “COVID-19,” and by cross-referencing citations in identified studies that were available in print or online before December 22, 2020. Measurements and Main Results: Asthma prevalence data were obtained from studies of people with COVID-19 and regional health statistics. We identified 150 studies worldwide that allowed us to compare the prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 by region, disease severity, and mortality. The results of our analyses do not provide clear evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, severity, or mortality due to asthma. Conclusions: These findings could provide some reassurance to people with asthma regarding its potential to increase their risk of severe morbidity from COVID-19.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33493416/; https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202008-3266oc";1/4/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9823

As a means to address the changing needs of our hospital’s HCWs, we conducted a narrative analysis study in the early stages of the covid-19 outbreak. A focus group of medical experts, conducted as the initial step, recommended that a bottom-up research tool be used for exploring HCWs’ traumatic experiences and needs. We therefore conducted 450 semi-structured in-depth interviews with hospital personnel. The interviews were based on Maslow’s Pyramid of Needs model, and the narratives were analyzed by applying the Listening Guide methodology. The interviewees expressed a need for physical and psychological security in the battle against Covid-19, in addition to the need for attachment and meaning. Importantly, we also found that the interview itself may serve as a therapeutic tool. In light of our findings, we recommended changes in hospital practices, which were subsequently implemented. Further research on HCWs’ traumatic experiences and needs will provide evidence-based knowledge and may enable novel approaches in the battle against Covid-19. To conclude, the knowledge generated by listening to HCWs’ narratives may provide suitable support programs for professionals.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899163/";3/9/2020;Healthcare workers;0.9202
1916;Psychological impact of Covid-19 pandemic in Italian families of children with neurodevelopmental disorders.;10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103840;Research on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted negative effects on the general population and particularly on parents. However, little is known about families of children with Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD). The present study investigated parental stress, coparenting, and child adjustment in Italian families with children with NDD (N = 82) and typical developing children (TD, N = 82) during lockdown, using an online survey. Results of quantitative analyses showed a significant increase in parental stress and child externalizing behaviors, but not of coparenting. Parental stress is predicted by externalizing behaviors, and coparenting acted as a moderator in the relationship between the change in the amount of time spent with the children before and during lockdown and parental stress. In children with NDD, the decrease in therapeutic/rehabilitation support predicted higher externalizing behaviors. Qualitative analysis showed that beyond the difficulties and worries arising during lockdown, most of the parents appreciated the opportunity of spending more time with their children and strengthening the parent-child relationship. In conclusion, our results point out the importance of ensuring continuity of care for children with NDD (e.g. telehealth) during home confinement and of providing psychological support for parents.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33383468/";23/12/2020;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;0.9813

In this study, an eco-friendly, facile, and cost-effective wet-spinning cellulose carbamate fiber technology was developed, and N-halamine regenerated cellulose fiber (RCC-Cl) with rechargeable and rapid bactericidal properties were prepared by the Lewis acid-assisted chlorination method. The chemical properties of the fibers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The mechanical and surface topography of the treated fiber was investigated by tensile testing and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the mechanical properties of RCC-Cl fibers can reach a breaking strength of 12.1 cN/tex and a breaking elongation of 41.4% with the optimized spinning process. Furthermore, RCC-Cl showed excellent antimicrobial activities, which can inactivate Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration of 10(7) CFU/mL within 1 min.

1919;Can a metabolism-targeted therapeutic intervention successfully subjugate coronavirus? A scientific rational;10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110694;As a process entailing a high turnover of the host cell molecules, viral replication is required for a successful viral infection and requests virus capacity to acquire the macromolecules required for its propagation. To this end, viruses have adopted several strategies to harness cellular metabolism in accordance with their specific demands. Most viruses upregulate specific cellular anabolic pathways and are largely dependent on such alterations. RNA viruses, for example, upregulate both glycolysisand glycogenolysis providing TCA cycle intermediates essential for anabolic lipogenesis. Also, these infections usually induce the PPP, leading to increased nucleotide levels supporting viral replication. SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19)that has so far spread from China throughout the world is also an RNA virus. Owing to the more metabolic plasticity of uninfected cells, a promising approach for specific antiviral therapy, which has drawn a lot of attention in the recent years, would be the targeting of metabolic changes induced by viruses. In the current review, we first summarize some of virus-induced metabolic adaptations and then based on these information as well as SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, propose a potential therapeutic modality for this calamitous world-spreading virus with the hope of employing this strategy for near-future clinical application.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332220308878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32920511/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110694; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220308878?v=s5";27/8/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9894

These systems are new and are based on smartphone technology that has not traditionally been used for this purpose, presenting challenges in understanding possible outcomes. In this work, we use individual-based computational models to explore how digital exposure notifications can be used in conjunction with non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as traditional contact tracing and social distancing, to influence COVID-19 disease spread in a population. Specifically, we use a representative model of the household and occupational structure of three counties in the state of Washington together with a proposed digital exposure notifications deployment to quantify impacts under a range of scenarios of adoption, compliance, and mobility. In a model in which 15% of the population participated, we found that digital exposure notification systems could reduce infections and deaths by approximately 8% and 6%, effectively complementing traditional contact tracing. We believe this can serve as guidance to health authorities in Washington state and beyond on how exposure notification systems can complement traditional public health interventions to suppress the spread of COVID-19.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.29.20184135v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.29.20184135";2/9/2020;Contact tracing;0.9863

While vaccine updates for current variants of concern (VOCs) are underway, it is likewise important to prepare for further antigenic mutations as the virus navigates the heterogeneous global landscape of host immunity. Toward this end, a wealth of data and tools exist that can augment existing genetic surveillance of VOC evolution. In this study, we integrate published datasets describing genetic, structural, and functional constraints on mutation along with computational analyses of antibody-spike co-crystal structures to identify a set of potential antigenic drift sites (PADS) within the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Further, we project the PADS set into a continuous epitope-paratope space to facilitate interpretation of the degree to which newly observed mutations might be antigenically synergistic with existing VOC mutations, and this representation suggests that functionally convergent and synergistic antigenic mutations are accruing across VOC NTDs. The PADS set and synergy visualization serve as a reference as new mutations are detected on VOCs, enable proactive investigation of potentially synergistic mutations, and offer guidance to antibody and vaccine design efforts.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127976/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.07.446560";8/6/2021;receptor binding domain;0.9837
1923;Entscheidungen über die Zuteilung intensivmedizinischer Ressourcen im Kontext der COVID-19-Pandemie: Klinisch-ethische Empfehlungen der DIVI, der DGINA, der DGAI, der DGIIN, der DGNI, der DGP, der DGP und der AEM;10.1007/s00063-020-00708-w;In view of the globally evolving Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, German hospitals rapidly expanded their intensive care capacities. However, it is possible that even with an optimal use of the increased resources, these will not suffice for all patients in need. Therefore, recommendations for the allocation of intensive care resources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed by a multidisciplinary authors group with support of eight scientific medical societies. The recommendations for procedures and criteria for prioritisations in case of resource scarcity are based on scientific evidence, ethico-legal considerations and practical experience. Medical decisions must always be based on the need and the treatment preferences of the individual patient. In addition to this patient-centred approach, prioritisations in case of resource scarcity require a supra-individual perspective. In such situations, prioritisations should be based on the criterion of clinical prospect of success in order to minimize the number of preventable deaths due to resource scarcity and to avoid discrimination based on age, disabilities or social factors. Assessment of the clinical prospect of success should take into account the severity of the current illness, severe comorbidities and the patient’s general health status prior to the current illness.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00063-020-00708-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32728769/";29/7/2020;Coronavirus Disease;0.9928
1924;Comparison and Application of Different Immunoassay Methods for the Detection of SARS‐CoV‐2;10.1002/jmv.26187;The detection data of IgM and IgG antibodies in 169 patients with coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) were analyzed to evaluate differences in clinical performance between the colloidal gold method and chemiluminescence method. In this study, chemiluminescence detection of IgM antibody showed a positive conversion earlier (about 1~2 days earlier), positive conversion rates higher in different stages of disease, and a trend of declining positive rate later than colloidal gold method. For IgG antibody, the chemiluminescence method showed a positive conversion earlier and the positive rate climbing more quickly than the colloidal gold method. No obvious negative‐converting tendency of IgG detection was observed within 35 days after the onset of disease. Although colloidal gold method is generally less sensitive than chemiluminescence method, it shows advantages of shorter turn‐around time, more simple procedure and no special equipment required. The two methodologies can be chosen according to different laboratory conditions. A reasonable understanding of the performance of reagents with different methodologies can help in clinical disease diagnosis effectively and assist in the diagnosis of the progression of COVID‐19, for which the dynamic changes of antibody will provide reliable evidence.

According to the author, the Russian Government has chosen the right strategy to combat COVID-19, and as a result, the damage caused by coronavirus infection was less in our country than in many other countries. To develop a system of measures that have been successfully implemented at a construction enterprise, the author studied the general for all employers and special industry (for construction) regulatory documents and methodological recommendations developed by the authorities of the Russian Federation, Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing, the Ministry of Health of Russia, the Ministry of Construction of Russia, the Government of Moscow, The Government of the Moscow Region, the Association “All-Russian Non-State Non-Commercial Organization - the All-Russian Industry Association of Employers “National Association of Self-Regulatory Organizations Based on Membership of Persons Carrying Out Construction”, and on their basis a system of organizational and control measures was prepared and implemented into the work of the enterprise, presented in the article.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971674/;18/9/2020;coronavirus infection;0.9309
1926;Sex, age, and hospitalization drive antibody responses in a COVID-19 convalescent plasma donor population.;10.1172/jci142004;Convalescent plasma is a leading treatment for COVID-19, but there is a paucity of data identifying therapeutic efficacy. Among 126 potential convalescent plasma donors, the humoral immune response was evaluated by a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assay using Vero-E6-TMPRSS2 cells, commercial IgG and IgA ELISA to spike(S) protein S1 domain (Euroimmun), IgA, IgG and IgM indirect ELISAs to the full-length S or S-receptor binding domain(S-RBD), and an IgG avidity assay. Multiple linear regression and predictive models were utilized to assess the correlations between antibody responses with demographic and clinical characteristics. IgG titers were greater than either IgM or IgA for S1, full length S, and S-RBD in the overall population. Of the 126 plasma samples, 101(80%) had detectable neutralizing antibody(nAb) titers. Using nAb titers as the reference, the IgG ELISAs confirmed between 95-98% of the nAb positive, but only 20-32% of the nAb negative samples. Male sex, older age, and hospitalization with COVID-19 were associated with increased antibody responses across the serological assays. There was substantial heterogeneity in the antibody response among potential convalescent plasma donors, but sex, age, and hospitalization emerged as factors that can be used to identify individuals with a high likelihood of having strong antiviral antibody responses.;"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci142004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764200/";7/8/2020;Convalescent plasma;0.9136
1927;Initial assessment and management of respiratory infections in persons with spinal cord injuries and disorders in the COVID‐19 era;10.1002/emp2.12282;As the COVID‐19 pandemic unfolds, emergency department (ED) personnel will face a higher caseload, including those with special medical needs such as persons living with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D). Individuals with SCI/D who develop COVID‐19 are at higher risk for rapid decompensation and development of acute respiratory failure during respiratory infections due to the combination of chronic respiratory muscle paralysis and autonomic dysregulation causing neurogenic restrictive/obstructive lung disease and chronic immune dysfunction. Often, acute respiratory infections will lead to significant mucus production in individuals with SCI/D, and aggressive secretion management is an important component of successful medical treatment. Secretion management techniques include nebulized bronchodilators, chest percussion/drainage techniques, manually assisted coughing techniques, nasotracheal suctioning, and mechanical insufflation–exsufflation. ED professionals, including respiratory therapists, should be familiar with the significant comorbidities associated with SCI/D and the customized secretion management procedures and techniques required for optimal medical management and prevention of respiratory failure. Importantly, protocols should also be implemented to minimize potential COVID‐19 spread during aerosol‐generating procedures.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33392545/";24/10/2020;emergency department;0.9417
1928;Exploring the future of startup leadership development;10.1016/j.jbvi.2020.e00200;Leadership development (LD) is a crucial success factor for startups to increase their human capital, survival rate, and overall performance. However, only a minority of young ventures actively engage in LD, and research rather focuses on large corporations and SMEs, which do not share the typical startup characteristics such as a rather young workforce, flat hierarchies, resource scarcity, and high time pressure. To overcome this practical and theoretical lack of knowledge, we engage in foresight and explore which leadership development techniques will be most relevant for startups within the next five to ten years. To formulate the most probable scenario, we conduct an international, two-stage Delphi study with 27 projections among industry experts. According to the expert panel, the majority of startups will engage in leadership development over the next decade. Most startups will aim to develop the leadership capabilities of their workforce as a whole and use external support. The most prominent prospective LD measures in startups include experiential learning methods, such as action learning, developmental job assignments, multi-rater feedback, as well as digital experiential learning programs, and developmental relationships such as coaching in digital one-to-one sessions. Self-managed learning will play a more important role than formal training.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352673420300561; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352673420300561";30/11/2020;Leadership development;0.9734
1929;Performing gynecologic cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey: A multicenter retrospective observational study.;10.1002/ijgo.13296;OBJECTIVE To report the perioperative outcomes of 200 patients with gynecologic cancer who underwent surgery during the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the safety of surgical approach. METHODS Data of patients operated between March 10 and May 20, 2020, were collected retrospectively. Data were statistically analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics for Windows v. SP21.0. RESULTS Data of 200 patients were included. Their mean age was 56 years. Of the patients, 54% (n=108), 27.5% (n=55), 12.5% (n=25), and 2% (n=4) were diagnosed as having endometrial, ovarian, cervical, and vulvar cancer, respectively. Of them, 98% underwent non-emergent surgery. A minimally invasive surgical approach was used in 18%. Stage 1 cancer was found in 68% of patients. Surgeons reported COVID-related changes in 10% of the cases. The rate of postoperative complications was 12%. Only two patients had cough and suspected pneumonic lesions on thoracic computed tomography postoperatively, but neither was positive for COVID-19 on polymerase chain reaction testing. CONCLUSION Based on the present findings, it is thought that gynecologic cancer surgery should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic while adhering to the measures. Postponement or non-surgical management should only be considered in patients with documented infection.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32623717/";4/7/2020;Novel Coronavirus Disease;0.9865
1930;Did people’s behavior after receiving negative COVID-19 tests contribute to the spread?;10.1093/pubmed/fdab010;BACKGROUND: Testing on demand for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is hypothesized to increase spread of the virus as some persons who test negative falsely assume that they can engage in activities that increase spread. METHODS: Daily new COVID-19 hospitalization counts through 2020 from 25 countries that reported testing and hospitalizations were studied by regression of logarithms of new hospitalizations 14 days out against log(new hospitalizations on a given day), log(negative tests), log(positivity rate) and days since the first hospitalizations were reported. The regression coefficients were examined separately for periods in countries that were following three different testing policies. RESULTS: Corrected for the other factors, negative test numbers when tested on demand and tested if symptomatic only are associated with an increase in hospitalizations 14 days after the tests. When only the symptomatic and more vulnerable are tested, negative tests are associated with fewer hospitalizations 2 weeks out. CONCLUSIONS: A policy of testing only vulnerable populations, whether symptomatic or not, appears to avoid spreading the virus as a result of testing policy. False confidence of reduced risk among those who test negative may have contributed to the spread in countries that allowed testing on demand or testing only those who claimed to have symptoms.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558889/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab010";8/2/2021;Testing on demand for coronavirus disease;0.973

The combination between local analyses and a public repository of allelic data strikes a balance between potential confidentiality issues and the need to compare results. The possibility of deploying private instances of chewie-NS facilitates the creation of nomenclature servers with a restricted user base to allow compliance with the strictest data policies. Chewie-NS allows users to easily share their own schemas and to explore publicly available schemas, including informative statistics on schemas and loci presented in interactive charts and tables. Users can retrieve all the information necessary to run a schema locally or all the alleles identified at a particular locus. The integration with the chewBBACA suite enables users to directly upload new schemas to chewie-NS, download existing schemas and synchronize local and remote schemas from chewBBACA command line version, allowing an easier integration into high-throughput analysis pipelines. The same REST API linking chewie-NS and the chewBBACA suite supports the interaction of other interfaces or pipelines with the databases available at chewie-NS, facilitating the reusability of the stored data.;"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068420/";17/10/2020;Chewie Nomenclature Server;0.9397

During the period from 2/4/2020 to 18/5/2020, a total of 219 blood samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Collection of samples were divided in two categories; random samples from public community and samples from health care workers belong to two Governmental hospitals and one private clinic. One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test was used. Out of the 219 samples tested, 6 (2.74%) samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. All health-care workers were tested negative. All positive cases were females and 5 of them aged between 44 to 75 years and one aged 32 years. The prevalence in young females ([≤]40 years) was 1.4% in total young females tested in the study and 1.75% in young females taken from public community. The prevalence in older females aged ( 40 years), was 11.1% in total females tested and 13.9% in females taken from public community. In conclusion, the preliminary investigation of SARS-CoV-2 revealed considerable prevalence in Alzintan City although the disease seems to be in its mild form.

1933;Accelerated epigenetic aging as a risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and decreased lung function in two prospective cohort studies.;10.18632/aging.103784;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a frequent diagnosis in older individuals and contributor to global morbidity and mortality. Given the link between lung disease and aging, we need to understand how molecular indicators of aging relate to lung function and disease. Using data from the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) surveys, we associated baseline epigenetic (DNA methylation) age acceleration with incident COPD and lung function. Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, height, weight, and baseline lung disease as appropriate. Associations were replicated in the Normative Aging Study. Of 770 KORA participants, 131 developed incident COPD over 7 years. Baseline accelerated epigenetic aging was significantly associated with incident COPD. The change in age acceleration (follow-up - baseline) was more strongly associated with COPD than baseline aging alone. The association between the change in age acceleration between baseline and follow-up and incident COPD replicated in the Normative Aging Study. Associations with spirometric lung function parameters were weaker than those with COPD, but a meta-analysis of both cohorts provide suggestive evidence of associations. Accelerated epigenetic aging, both baseline measures and changes over time, may be a risk factor for COPD and reduced lung function.;"https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747609/";3/8/2020;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9357

Most employees were forced to work from home and take care of their children because schools and daycares were closed. We present data from a research project in a large multinational organisation in the Netherlands with monthly quantitative measurements from January to May 2020 (N = 253-516), enriched with qualitative data from participants' comments before and after telework had started. Growth curve modelling showed major changes in employees' work-related well-being reflected in decreasing work engagement and increasing job satisfaction. For work-non-work balance, workload and autonomy, cubic trends over time were found, reflecting initial declines during crisis onset (March/April) and recovery in May. Participants' additional remarks exemplify that employees struggled with fulfilling different roles simultaneously, developing new routines and managing boundaries between life domains. Moderation analyses demonstrated that demographic variables shaped time trends. The diverging trends in well-being indicators raise intriguing questions and show that close monitoring and fine-grained analyses are needed to arrive at a better understanding of the impact of the crisis across time and among different groups of employees.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826148/";7/4/2021;coronavirus disease;0.965

This study examines the numerical simulation in a room containing a manikin sitting in front of a computer. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools were considered using ANSYS Fluent 16.2 software. This software exploits the finite volume method that is based on the resolution of the Navier-Stokes equations. The distribution of the temperature, velocity, static pressure, turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent viscosity, and turbulent dissipation is tested in different planes and different directions to characterize the airflow indoor a heated room. Equally, the thermal comfort is examined by calculating the predicted mean vote (PMV). The comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data founded from the literature prove that the supply of airflow was affected by the presence of the heat sources and the thermal climate is considered as a slightly hot. The use of the adequate meshes is in a good agreement with the experimental data and confirms the validity of the numerical approach.

Although most of the cases are mild, patients from risk populations could develop a cytokine storm, which is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure. The present paper will introduce the small molecule MP1032, describe its mode of action, and give rationale why it is a promising option for prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. MP1032 is a phase-pure anhydrous polymorph of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-pthalazinedione sodium salt that exhibits good stability and bioavailability. The physiological action of MP1032 is based on a multi-target mechanism including localized, self- limiting antioxidant activities that were demonstrated in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced joint inflammation. Furthermore, immune-regulatory and PARP-1 modulating properties, coupled with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 were shown in various cell models. Efficacy has been preclinically elucidated in LPS-induced endotoxemia, a model with excessively activated immune responses that shares many similarities to COVID-19. So far, during oral clinical development with three-months daily administrations, no serious adverse drug reactions occurred highlighting the outstanding safety profile of MP1032.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.03.20216580; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.03.20216580v1?rss=1";4/11/2020;multiorgan disease;0.9359
1937;Correlation-Aware Deep Generative Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection;10.1007/978-3-030-47436-2_52;Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous samples from highly complex and unstructured data, which is pervasive in both fundamental research and industrial applications. However, most existing methods neglect the complex correlation among data samples, which is important for capturing normal patterns from which the abnormal ones deviate. In this paper, we propose a method of Correlation aware unsupervised Anomaly detection via Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (CADGMM), which captures the complex correlation among data points for high-quality low-dimensional representation learning. More specifically, the relations among data samples are correlated firstly in forms of a graph structure, in which, the node denotes the sample and the edge denotes the correlation between two samples from the feature space. Then, a dual-encoder that consists of a graph encoder and a feature encoder, is employed to encode both the feature and correlation information of samples into the low-dimensional latent space jointly, followed by a decoder for data reconstruction. Finally, a separate estimation network as a Gaussian Mixture Model is utilized to estimate the density of the learned latent vector, and the anomalies can be detected by measuring the energy of the samples. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206313/;17/4/2020;Deep Gaussian Mixture Model;0.9718
1938;The Potential of Sweetpotato as a Functional Food in Sub-Saharan Africa and Its Implications for Health: A Review;10.3390/molecules26102971;Increasing urbanization in developing countries has resulted in busier lifestyles, accompanied by consumption of fast foods. The consequence is an increased prevalence in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Food-based approaches would be cheaper and more sustainable in reducing these NCDs compared to drugs, which may have side effects. Studies have suggested that consuming functional foods could potentially lower NCD risks. Sweetpotato is regarded as a functional food because it contains bioactive compounds. Recently, sweetpotato has gained attention in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but research has focused on its use in alleviating micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A deficiency, particularly the orange-fleshed variety of sweetpotato. Some studies conducted in other parts of the world have investigated sweetpotato as a functional food. There is a need to characterize the sweetpotato varieties in SSA and determine how processing affects their bioactive components. This review highlights some of the studies conducted in various parts of the world on the functionality of sweetpotato, its bioactive compounds, and how these are influenced by processing. In addition, the potential health benefits imparted by sweetpotato are expounded. The knowledge gaps that remain in these studies are also addressed, focusing on how they can direct sweetpotato research in SSA.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26102971; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067782/";17/5/2021;noncommunicable diseases;0.9419
1939;[Social Inequalities and COVID-19: Social-Epidemiological Perspectives on the Pandemic].;10.1055/a-1226-6708;The new Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) hits specific population groups harder than others. However, social-epidemiological patterns of the pandemic which go beyond differences by age and gender have hardly been addressed in Germany. First reports from other western industrialised countries indicate that people living in socioeconomically deprived areas and people of color have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 progression and mortality. Social inequalities in the risk of infection due to different living and working conditions, and social inequalities in the susceptibility and risk factors for severe COVID-19, particularly in pre-existing medical conditions, might play an important role in explaining those findings. Such inequalities are well established for Germany, as well. It can therefore be assumed that also in Germany people with a lower socioeconomic status might be more affected during the further course of the pandemic. In addition, the interventions to contain the pandemic might have unequal social, economic and psychological impacts on different social groups. Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has the overall potential to increase social and health inequalities. Social-epidemiological research into COVID-19 is therefore needed to advance measures of health protection and infection control in an evidence-based, targeted and socially equitable manner.;"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1226-6708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32858757/";28/8/2020;Coronavirus Disease;0.943

Seven complexityinformed principles previously published in this Journal are applied to formulate recommendations to improve the design and implementation of metrics. (1) Acknowledge unpredictability. When designing a metric, policy-makers need to leave room for flexibility to account for unforeseen situations. When implementing a metric, they need to promote sense-making of relevant stakeholders. (2) Sense-making shall be encouraged because it is a social process to understand a metric, align values and develop a coherent strategy. Sense-making is important to (3) cope with self-organised gaming behaviours and to (4) facilitate interdependencies between ED and other departments as well as organisations. (5) We also need to attend to the relationship between senior management and frontline staff. Additionally, to address one of the methodological weaknesses in Tenbensel and colleagues' study, (6) adaptive research approach is needed to better answer emerging questions. (7) Conflict should be harnessed productively. I hope these recommendations could limit gaming in future metrics and encourage stakeholders to view inevitable gaming as an improvement opportunity.;"https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.47; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610793/";4/4/2020;New Zealand Emergency Department;0.9427

Nearly 90% of construction jobs require manual handling of materials for approximately one half of the worker's time (1). In 2015, overexertion from lifting and lowering materials caused 30% of WMSDs among construction workers; overexertion involving pushing, pulling, holding, carrying, and catching materials caused an additional 37% of WMSDs (1). This study examined the rate and cost of WMSD claims from overexertion among Ohio construction workers during 2007-2017. Workers' compensation claims related to overexertion that were submitted to the Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation (OHBWC) by workers in the construction industry for injuries and illnesses occurring during 2007-2017 were analyzed. Rates and costs of allowed claims were measured by age group. Workers aged 35-44 years experienced the highest claim rate: 63 per 10,000 full-time employees (FTEs) for WMSDs from overexertion. However, claims by workers aged 45-54 years and 55-64 years were more costly on average and resulted in more days away from work. Ergonomic design improvements and interventions are needed to ensure that the majority of construction workers can safely perform jobs throughout their careers.

The novelty of the virus spurred frequently changing guidance as nursing facilities navigated response efforts. In May 2020, the 6-month COVID-19 Rapid Response Network for Nursing Homes (RRN) was launched to leverage the concept of huddles across U.S. nursing homes to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity, mortality, and transmission by identifying best practices to rapidly implement, fostering connections between nursing homes, and refocusing the national narrative on optimism for nursing home care response efforts. Daily 20-min huddles transitioned to twice weekly in the program's final two months. A total of 93 huddles featured 103 speakers with 1960 participants engaging in both live huddles and asynchronous learning. 90.33% of participants said they learned at least two new ideas by participating and 89.17% strongly agreed or agreed that participating improved their ability to lead change in their organization. Qualitative data echoed gratitude for a centralized source of information and best practices and the sense of positivity and community the RRN provided.

1943;Retrorenal fat predicts grade C pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy.;10.1111/ans.16147;BACKGROUND Pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy is one of the most severe complications with mortality rates as high as 45%, and the prediction of most severe form of fistula (grade C) is crucial for successful management of patients who are to undergo cephalic pancreatoduodenectomy. It has been found that the amount of abdominal fat may predict grade C postoperative pancreatic fistula. In this study, we analysed the value of retrorenal fat thickness in the prediction of grade C pancreatic fistula. METHODS A total of 140 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy were retrospectively analysed. Retrorenal fat thickness and intra-abdominal fat, expressed as total fat area, visceral fat area and subcutaneous fat area, were determined from computed tomography slices using the known range of attenuation values (-190 to -30). Blood loss, operating time, pancreatic texture and main pancreatic duct diameter as well as body mass index were also analysed. RESULTS Retrorenal fat thickness (P = 0.0004), duct diameter (P = 0.0008), subcutaneous fat area (P = 0.023) and total fat area (P = 0.014) were found to be significant predictors of grade C pancreatic fistula. CONCLUSION Although retrorenal fat tissue thickness may seem robust, it is a simple measure that can be used to predict the most severe grade of pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.16147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691479/";20/7/2020;Pancreatic fistula;0.9059
1944;En route to Peptide Therapeutics for COVID 19: Harnessing Potential Antigenic Mimicry Between Viral and Human Proteins;10.1007/s41403-020-00132-8;Molecular mimicry is a general strategy used by pathogens to infect the host cells. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in more than 6,700,000 infections and 390,000 deaths worldwide. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by this virus. In this project concept, we aim to focus on the peptide-protein interaction analysis using two important drug targets in SARS-CoV-2 such as spike (S) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein. These proteins play an important role in the virus entry and encapsidation of the viral particles. Motifs or functional regions in these two proteins must be sharing sequence homology with human protein (ACE2) which may be involved in the binding mechanism. The results will show a set of motif regions which can disrupt the viral infection. Once we identify these sets of antigenic determinant regions, antibody binding activity studies can be performed by in vitro methods. Our results from this study may suggest the existence of antigenic mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 and host proteins. The hit peptide components will have therapeutic applications to be developed into a wide variety of medicinal formulations against SARS-CoV-2 such as vaccine, intranasal and inhalation formulations. Also, the choice of conserved regions will lead to development of cross protective therapeutics against wide range of coronaviruses.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306100/;21/6/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9633
1945;The pattern of neonatal gastro-intestinal perforation in upper Egypt;10.1186/s43159-020-00029-9;BACKGROUND: Neonatal gastro-intestinal perforation [NGIP] is one of the major problems in pediatric surgical practice. Although the outcomes of neonatal surgery have improved markedly over the past decade the mortality rates of neonates with NGIP are still high. The aim of this study was to present the possible etiological factors, clinical findings, and operative procedures of NIP in our locality. RESULTS: A total of 34 neonates with NGIP were included in this study. The median age at presentation was (15.8 ± 7.0 SD) days. The median interval between presentation and surgical interference was (2.0 ± 1.1 SD).Necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC] was the commonest cause of neonatal gastro-intestinal perforation. The commonest site of perforation was the colon [11cases]. The overall mortality rate was 11 cases [32.4%]. The main cause of mortality was neonatal NEC [6 cases]. Eight cases [40 %] died out of 20 cases which the interval between the presentation and interference were more than one day. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal gastro-intestinal perforations are still associated with high mortality rate in our institutions, and delayed diagnosis with increased interval between the presentation and surgical intervention are associated with increased mortality. In our locality, although NEC is the commonest cause of NGIP, the iatrogenic cause is relatively higher than reported.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314571/;25/6/2020;Neonatal gastro-intestinal perforation;0.9607

It is of utmost importance to identify the future infected cases and the virus spread rate for advance preparation in the healthcare services to avoid deaths. Accurately forecasting the spread of COVID-19 is an analytical and challenging real-world problem to the research community. Therefore, we use day level information of COVID-19 spread for cumulative cases from whole world and 10 mostly affected countries; US, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Russia, Iran, United Kingdom, Turkey, and India. We utilize the temporal data of coronavirus spread from January 22, 2020 to May 20, 2020. We model the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, and perform prediction using ARIMA and Prophet time series forecasting models. Effectiveness of the models are evaluated based on the mean absolute error, root mean square error, root relative squared error, and mean absolute percentage error. Our analysis can help in understanding the trends of the disease outbreak, and provide epidemiological stage information of adopted countries. Our investigations show that ARIMA model is more effective for forecasting COVID-19 prevalence. The forecasting results have potential to assist governments to plan policies to contain the spread of the virus.";https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12176v1.pdf;22/7/2020;Coronavirus;0.9271
1947;Who wants to reopen the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic? The daring and uncaring;10.1016/j.paid.2020.110335;Economic shutdowns, which refer to disallowing employees to work on site, are among the most contentious approaches to reduce the spread of COVID-19. While economic shutdowns save lives, their large economic costs have caused some people to develop strong attitudes and even break government-issued mandates, which incurs health risks and often the need to extend the economic shutdowns. In the current article, we argue that the interaction of two personality characteristics, risk-taking tendencies and prosocial tendencies, is a strong determinant of attitudes toward economic shutdowns, and we assess the impact of this interaction on three different attitudes toward economic shutdowns that differ by their focal target: employees, customers, and organizations. The results demonstrate that this interaction significantly predicted economic shutdown attitudes toward customers and organizations but not employees. We suggest that these results can be understood via the lens of behavioral decision-making theories as well as a recent framework on antisocial risk takers, both of which provide several subsequent directions for future research. We conclude with recommendations for the development of effective messages to curb defiant behaviors toward economic shutdowns, such as focusing on those most likely to perform these problematic behaviors – the daring and uncaring.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110335; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886920305262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834292/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305262";1/1/2021;Economic shutdowns;0.9493

We applied a two-stage Bayesian spatial model to quantify inequalities in excess mortality at the community level during the first wave of the pandemic in England. We used geocoded data on all deaths in people aged 40 years and older during March-May 2020 compared with 2015-2019 in 6,791 local communities. Here we show that communities with an increased risk of excess mortality had a high density of care homes, and/or high proportion of residents on income support, living in overcrowded homes and/or high percent of people with a non-White ethnicity (including Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups). Conversely, after accounting for other community characteristics, we found no association between population density or air pollution and excess mortality. Overall, the social and environmental variables accounted for around 15% of the variation in mortality at community level. Effective and timely public health and healthcare measures that target the communities at greatest risk are urgently needed if England and other industrialised countries are to avoid further widening of inequalities in mortality patterns during the second wave.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.19.20234849v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.19.20234849";1/1/2020;Coronavirus Disease 19;0.955

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requires early detection and monitoring, within a clinical environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases, with a large spectrum of symptoms. The fear of contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to continuously monitor non-severe COVID-19 patients, either from their quarantine site at home, or dedicated quarantine locations (e.g., hotels). In particular, facilitating contact tracing with proximity and location tracing apps was adopted in many countries very rapidly. Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively monitor patient health status. In this paper, we present a review of remote health monitoring initiatives taken in 20 states during the time of the pandemic. We emphasize in the discussion particular aspects that are common ground for the reviewed states, in particular the future impact of the pandemic on remote health monitoring and consideration on data privacy.;"https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/abba0a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32947271/";18/9/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9955

Our study draws upon SK&A data covering primary care physicians and psychiatrists in eight states (California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Ohio, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and West Virginia), which were linked to a list of waivered buprenorphine prescribers from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. We calculated waivered rates stratified by patient limits, physician type, health system affiliation, and area-level characteristics. We mapped the spatial relationship between hospitals and waivered physicians in four metro areas. We found that primary care physicians affiliated with hospital health systems were less likely to have waivers than unaffiliated physicians (3.6% versus 8.2%), but the reverse was true for psychiatrists (33.2% versus 26.2%). Waivered physicians affiliated with health systems were less likely to practice in high-poverty areas than unaffiliated counterparts, and affiliated physicians were also more likely to cluster near hospitals. Health systems may be able to improve access to buprenorphine treatment in their communities by creating either incentives or mandates for more affiliated physicians to obtain a waiver.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600622/";1/8/2020;opioid use disorder;0.9547

Depending on the amount of cytokines released as the result of the immunological activation induced by SARS-CoV2, three major clinical phenotypes can be identified: ""mild"",symbolized as a ""drizzle"" of cytokines, severe as a ""storm"", and critical as a ""hurricane"". In patients with mild symptoms, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is balanced to obtain a defense response against the virus which is often self-limiting and overcomes without tissue damage. In severe phenotype, resembling a ""cytokine-release syndrome"", SARS-CoV2 causes the lysis of the immune-mediators leading to a cytokine storm able to induce lung epithelium damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In critical patients, the immune response may become uncontrolled, thus the cytokine burst resembles a form of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which may result in a multi organ failure. In addition to the standard of care, an immune-modulatory therapy tailored to each one of the different phenotypes should be used in order to prevent or reduce the release of cytokines responsible for organ damage and disease progression.";"https://doi.org/10.1177/1535370220928964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32460624/";28/5/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9781

As of August 25, 2020, 23.719 million people have been infected in many countries. The cu-mulative death toll exceeds 812,000. Early detection of COVID-19 is essential to provide patients with appropriate medical care and protect uninfected people. Leveraging a large computed tomography (CT) database from 1,112 patients provided by China Consortium of Chest CT Image Investiga-tion (CC-CCII), we investigated multiple solutions in detect-ing COVID-19 and distinguished it from other common pneumonia (CP) and normal controls. We also compared the performance of different models for complete and segmented CT slices. In particular, we studied the effects of CT-superimposition depths into volumes on the performance of our models. The results show that the optimal model can identify the COVID-19 slices with 99.76% accuracy (99.96% recall, 99.35% precision and 99.65% F1-score). The overall performance for three-way classification obtained 99.24% ac-curacy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9986.

1953;Overview of transnational recommendations for COVID‐19 transmission control in dental care settings;10.1111/odi.13431;On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) as a pandemic. Until an effective treatment or a vaccine is developed, the current recommendations are to contain the disease, and control its transmission. It is now clear that the primary mode of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission is aerosol/droplet spread, and by contacting virus‐contaminated surfaces acting as fomites (inanimate vectors). Furthermore, recent data indicate that the live virus particles are present in saliva, and, more alarmingly, asymptomatic individuals may transmit the infection. By virtue of the nature of the practice of dentistry where intrinsically, a high volume of aerosols is produced, as well as the close proximity of dentists and patients during treatment, dentists and allied health staff are considered the highest risk health professional group for acquiring SARS‐CoV‐2 during patient management. Therefore, several organizations and specialty associations have proposed guidelines and recommendations for limiting the transmission of SARS‐COV‐2 from carriers to dentists and vice versa. This paper aims to provide a review of these guidelines, and concludes with a brief look at how the practice of dentistry may be impacted by COVID‐19, in the post‐pandemic era.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32428372/; https://doi.org/10.1111/odi.13431";3/6/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9655
1954;Cellular mechanisms underlying neurological/neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19.;10.1002/jmv.26720;Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection manifest mainly respiratory symptoms. However, clinical observations frequently identified neurological symptoms and neuropsychiatric disorders related to COVID-19 (Neuro-SARS2). Accumulated robust evidence indicates that Neuro-SARS2 may play an important role in aggravating the disease severity and mortality. Understanding the neuropathogenesis and cellular mechanisms underlying Neuro-SARS2 is crucial for both basic research and clinical practice to establish effective strategies for early detection/diagnosis, prevention, and treatment paradigms. In this review, we will comprehensively examine current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various neural cells including neurons, microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, pericytes/endothelial cells, ependymocytes/choroid epithelial cells, and neural stem/progenitor cells. Although significant progress has been made in studying Neuro-SARS2, much remains to be learned about the neuroinvasive routes (transneuronal and hematogenous) of the virus and the cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying the development/progression of this disease.

1955;Allostructions revisited;10.1016/j.pragma.2020.08.016;An important recent innovation in Construction Grammar (CxG) has been to assume the existence of a general underspecified construction underlying two or more alternating constructions, which themselves are considered to be formally and functionally related allostructions of the general construction. Despite this novel proposal, the meaning side of the general construction has either been neglected or couched in a single-layered view of meaning that does not adequately distinguish semantics from pragmatics. Building on state-of-the-art developments at the semantics-pragmatics interface, this article proposes an account whereby the distinction between the meaning of the general construction and the meaning of the allostructions aligns with the distinction between encoded (semantic) and inferred (pragmatic) meaning. We argue in favor of an allostructional account for two grammatical alternations which have previously been treated as an epiphenomenon of two underlying independent constructions: the German ditransitive alternation and the English genitive alternation. While demonstrating the fruitfulness of an allostructional analysis for these two new cases, we also provide critical observations about the wider applicability of allostructional analyses. In particular, we argue that an allostructional analysis proves to be trivial for Lambrechtian ‘allosentences’.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378216620301983; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pragma.2020.08.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921896/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216620301983";4/9/2020;Construction Grammar;0.984

1960;Videotherapy and therapeutic alliance in the age of COVID‐19;10.1002/cpp.2521;The arrival of the coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic has confronted us with a global and unprecedented challenge of community‐wide psychological distress alongside reduced access to therapeutic services in the traditional face‐to‐face format, due to the need to self‐isolate. This previously unimagineable set of circumstances provides a unique opportunity, and indeed an imperative, for videotherapy to fulfil its potential in addressing mental health and well‐being needs from a distance. Historically, the uptake of videotherapy has been hindered by psychotherapist expectations of inferior therapeutic alliance and outcomes, in spite of considerable research evidence to the contrary. Research suggests that videotherapy provides a powerful pathway for clients to experience enhanced opportunities for self‐expression, connection and intimacy. This more neutral therapeutic ‘space’ provides clients with multifarious opportunities for self‐awareness, creative experience and collaboration, with potentially a greater sense of agency over their own experience. This paper explores ways in which videotherapy can lead to a revitalisation of the concept of the therapeutic relationship, in order to meet the challenges associated with COVID‐19.

Infection can cause fever, dry cough, fatigue, severe pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome and in some instances death. COVID-19 affects the immune system by producing a systemic inflammatory response, or cytokine release syndrome. Patients with COVID-19 have shown a high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. There are currently no effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral drugs or vaccines. COVID-19 disproportionately affects the elderly, both directly, and through a number of significant age-related comorbidities. Undoubtedly, nutrition is a key determinant of maintaining good health. Key dietary components such as vitamins C, D, E, zinc, selenium and the omega 3 fatty acids have well-established immunomodulatory effects, with benefits in infectious disease. Some of these nutrients have also been shown to have a potential role in the management of COVID-19. In this paper, evidence surrounding the role of these dietary components in immunity as well as their specific effect in COVID-19 patients are discussed.

The relative contribution of viral transmission via fomites is still unclear. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to survive on inanimate surfaces for several days, yet the factors that determine its survival on surfaces are not well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for human respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Although saliva microdroplets dried out rapidly at all tested RH levels (unlike SM that remained hydrated at RH ≥ 57%), survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly higher than in water or SM. Thus, RH and hydration conditions are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely affect physicochemical properties that determine virus survival. The observed high virus survival in dry saliva deposited on surfaces, under a wide range of RH levels, can have profound implications for human public health, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.152983;16/6/2020;coronavirus respiratory syndrome;0.9188
1963;26 COVID-19 Diagnosis in Patients with Acute Abdominal Pain Without Respiratory Symptoms: A UK Emergency General Surgical Unit Experience;10.1093/bjs/znab134.031;INTRODUCTION: Evidence has emerged reporting atypical symptoms of the coronavirus (COVID-19). There is a sparsity of existing studies examining COVID-19 related abdominal pain and the role of investigative imaging for the virus in these patients. Study aims were to determine COVID-19 incidence in those with acute abdominal pain in the absence of respiratory symptoms and to assess the performance of Computer Tomography (CT) thoracic imaging. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of all patients admitted to our emergency general surgical unit between 1(st) March 2020 and 31(st) May 2020 was performed. All patients underwent nasal and oro-pharyngeal COVID-19 RT-PCR swabs as well as CT on admission. RESULTS: From 112 patients admitted with acute abdominal pain in the absence of respiratory symptoms, 16 (14.3%) tested positive for COVID-19 on RT-PCR swab testing. 50% (8/16) of these patients had no intra-abdominal pathology on CT. The sensitivity and specificity of CT thoracic imaging for COVID-19 was 43.8% and 91.7%. CONCLUSIONS: One in seven patients with abdominal pain without any respiratory symptoms tested positive. Half these patients represented COVID-19 manifesting primarily as acute abdominal pain. Combined swab testing and CT imaging should be performed in all abdominal pain presentations due to the varying diagnostic performance of thoracic CT in diagnosing COVID-19.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135705/;4/5/2021;coronavirus;0.9236
1964;More than half of hypoxemia cases occurred during the recovery period after completion of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with planned moderate sedation.;10.1038/s41598-020-61120-0;Guidelines advise precautionary measures for possible adverse events that may occur due to sedation during endoscopic procedures. To avoid complications, intraprocedural and postprocedural monitoring during recovery is considered important. However, since not many studies have reported on hypoxemia during the recovery period, findings for specific monitoring methods are insufficient. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of hypoxemia during the recovery period using continuous central-monitoring by pulse oximetry and to characterize the hypoxemia cases. Among the 4065 consecutive esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures under planned moderate sedation, 84 (2.1%) procedures developed unexpected hypoxemia (SpO2 ≤ 90%). Hypoxemia was observed during the procedure, at the end of the procedure, and during the recovery period in 21, 17, and 46 (1.1%) procedures, respectively. More than half of the hypoxemia cases occurred during the recovery period. Many hypoxemia cases were characterized by neither serious co-morbid illness nor low body mass index which have been reported as risk factors of hypoxemia. The lack of risk factors is no guarantee that hypoxemia will not occur. Therefore, continuous monitoring by pulse oximetry is more important during the recovery period and is recommended in all EGD procedures under planned moderate sedation.;"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61120-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152344/";9/3/2020;esophagogastroduodenoscopy;0.9969
1965;Working with families: A systematic scoping review of family-centred care in universal, community-based maternal, child, and family health services.;10.1177/1367493520930172;Children's long- and short-term health and developmental outcomes can be improved when families are engaged and supported, and inform care planning. Family-centred care (FCC) underpins policy directions for universal, community-based, child and family health services in the early years, although its implementation in this context is poorly understood. This systematic scoping review of the current literature aimed to improve understanding of FCC implementation in maternal, child, and family health universal services. Key databases and grey literature were searched using descriptors of maternal, child, and family health population and context, and FCC concept. Reference checking identified further literature for analysis. Thirteen included papers reported on nine studies from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Limited participant representation of fathers and diverse community members was evident. Deductive thematic analysis identified four areas of FCC demonstrated in this literature: respectful relationships, effective communication to foster shared understanding, flexible and contextualized care, and support for autonomy and agency. The literature demonstrated the interplay between organizational, professional, and recipient factors and their impact on the implementation of FCC. For successful FCC implementation, all these elements should be considered.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/1367493520930172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602735/";30/6/2020;Family-centred care;0.9295
1966;Drug repositioning candidates identified using in-silico quasi-quantum molecular simulation demonstrate reduced COVID-19 mortality in 1.5M patient records;10.1101/2021.03.22.21254110;BACKGROUND: Drug repositioning is a key component of COVID-19 pandemic response, through identification of existing drugs that can effectively disrupt COVID-19 disease processes, contributing valuable insights into disease pathways. Traditional non in silico drug repositioning approaches take substantial time and cost to discover effect and, crucially, to validate repositioned effects. METHODS: Using a novel in-silico quasi-quantum molecular simulation platform that analyzes energies and electron densities of both target proteins and candidate interruption compounds on High Performance Computing (HPC), we identified a list of FDA-approved compounds with potential to interrupt specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Subsequently we used 1.5M patient records from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative to create matched cohorts to refine our in-silico hits to those candidates that show statistically significant clinical effect. RESULTS: We identified four drugs, Metformin, Triamcinolone, Amoxicillin and Hydrochlorothiazide, that were associated with reduced mortality by 27%, 26%, 26%, and 23%, respectively, in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings provide support to our hypothesis that in-silico simulation of active compounds against SARS-CoV-2 proteins followed by statistical analysis of electronic health data results in effective therapeutics identification.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.21254110v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851170/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.22.21254110";6/4/2021;Drug repositioning;0.9171
1967;Baseline pulmonary levels of CD8+ T cells and NK cells inversely correlate with expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2;10.1101/2020.05.04.075291;Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and currently has detrimental human health, community and economic impacts around the world. In SARS-CoV-2-infected lung, induction of immune cell-recruiting cytokines is initially poor. When induction does occur, this may in fact exacerbate infection. These observations suggest that baseline levels of leukocytes, already residing in the lung prior to infection, may be important for orchestrating an effective early immune response. Hence, we performed “in silico flow cytometry” on 1,927 human lung tissues to deconvolute the levels of seven leukocyte types involved in triggering an acute anti-viral cellular immune response. Baseline levels of CD8+ T cells, resting natural killer (NK) cells and activated NK cells are significantly lower in lung tissues with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor ACE2. We observe this in univariate analyses, in multivariate analyses that include sex, age, race, body mass index and smoking history, and in two independent datasets. Elevated ACE2 expression increases sensitivity to coronavirus infection. Thus, our results suggest that a subgroup of individuals may be exceedingly susceptible to COVID-19 due to concomitant high preexisting ACE2 expression and low baseline cytotoxic lymphocyte levels in the lung.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.075291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511391/";5/5/2020;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9743

Clinical studies and systematic reviews along with hand-searched preclinical studies as potential therapies have been included. They support the proof-of-concept that novel treatments are in the pipeline towards ground-breaking clinical therapies for orofacial bone regeneration, tooth regeneration, repair of the oral mucosa, periodontal tissue engineering, and dental implants. Biomimicry enhances the clinical outcomes and calls for an interdisciplinary approach integrating medicine, bioengineering, biotechnology, and computational sciences to advance the current research to clinics.

1969;Stilbene-based Natural Compounds as Promising Drug Candidates against COVID-19.;10.1080/07391102.2020.1762743;The pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents a great threat to public health. Currently, no potent medicine is available to treat COVID-19. Quest for new drugs especially from natural plant sources is an area of immense potential. The current study aimed to repurpose stilbenoid analogs, reported for some other biological activities, against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 receptor complex for their affinity and stability using molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy analysis based on molecular docking. Four compounds in total were probed for their binding affinity using molecular docking. All of the compounds showed good affinity (> -7 kcal/mol). However, fifty nanoseconds molecular dynamic simulation in aqueous solution revealed highly stable bound conformation of resveratrol to the viral protein: ACE2 receptor complex. Net free energy of binding using MM-PBSA also affirmed the stability of the resveratrol-protein complex. Based on the results, we report that stilbene based compounds in general and resveratrol, in particular, can be promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidates acting through disruption of the spike protein. Our findings in this study are promising and call for further in vitro and in vivo testing of stiblenoids, especially resveratrol against the COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1762743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345140/";29/4/2020;pandemic coronavirus disease;0.9685
1970;What Is the Community Pharmacists’ Role in Supporting Older Australians with Palliative Care Needs?;10.3390/healthcare9050489;As the population ages, the number of older populations globally requiring palliative care is rapidly growing, requiring services of multidisciplinary teams—including community pharmacists. The aim of this study is to describe the community pharmacists’ perceived role in providing services to community dwelling older Australians receiving palliative care. Utilising an eight-domain End of Life Directions for Aged Care (ELDAC) care model, a national cross-sectional questionnaire was designed and undertaken online with Australian community pharmacists. Respondents were asked questions relating to socio-demographic characteristics, practice characteristics, and scope of services provided. Of the 62 pharmacists who responded to the questionnaire, 51 were included in the final data analysis and reporting. Pharmacists working in dispensing roles made up about half of the respondents, while the remainder worked in settings such as general practice, residential aged care, or providing medication review services. Pharmacists can identify patients with indicators of poor life expectancy and mostly work with older Australians daily. Dispensing and non-dispensing pharmacists offer a range of services that complement each other. Organisations caring for the aged should consider the role of the pharmacist, in caring for people with palliative care needs, along with their carers.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9050489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919247/";21/4/2021;End of Life Directions for Aged Care;0.9229

Therefore, it is important to identify the associated factors. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe our experience with a 37-year-old man diagnosed with severe viral pneumonia (influenza A). He presented with acute respiratory failure type I on admission. During intubation, his blood pressure and heart rate decreased, and epinephrine and norepinephrine were administered. Although his clinical condition improved 8 days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, he experienced difficulty weaning. He remained conscious but had a poor spontaneous cough with sputum production and weak limb muscle strength. His cough reflex was absent during bronchoscopic sputum suction, and he used abdominal breathing during the T-tube test. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an Arnold–Chiari malformation type I, posterior dislocation of the odontoid process, and syringomyelia, with compression and deformation of the medulla and high cervical cord. The patient was successfully weaned from the ventilator at 20 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Arnold–Chiari malformation type I and posterior dislocation of the odontoid process, which aggravate medullary compression and increase the risk of cervical nerve injury, might be a rare factor affecting prolonged weaning in critical illness.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7014774/;11/2/2020;Prolonged and difficult weaning;0.9113

Convalescent sera after infection with variants of concern (VOCs: B.1.1.7, n = 10; B.1.351, n = 1) and sera from 100 vaccinees (Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2, n = 33; Moderna, mRNA-1273, n = 11; AstraZeneca, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, n = 56) were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed against the viral spike (S)-protein, its receptor-binding domain (RBD), the nucleoprotein (N) and for virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNA). For the latter, surrogate assays (sVNT) and a Vero-cell based neutralization test (cVNT) were used. Maturity of IgG was determined by measuring the avidity in an immunoblot (IB). Past VOC infection resulted in a broad reactivity of anti-S IgG (100%), anti-RBD IgG (100%), and anti-N IgG (91%), while latter were absent in 99% of vaccinees. Starting approximately two weeks after the first vaccine dose, anti-S IgG (75-100%) and particularly anti-RBD IgG (98-100%) were detectable. After the second dose, their titers increased and were higher than in the convalescents. The sVNT showed evidence of VNA in 91% of convalescents and in 80-100%/100% after first/second vaccine dose, respectively.

1973;Saliva as a promising biofluid for SARS-CoV-2 detection during the early stages of infection.;10.24875/bmhim.20000204;Background Diagnostic testing for coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is performed using nasopharyngeal swabs. This type of sampling is uncomfortable for the patient, dangerous for health workers, and its high demand has led to a global shortage of swabs. One of the alternative specimens is saliva. However, the optimal conditions for the test have not been established. Methods Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the viral genome in saliva samples kept at room temperature, in the fridge or frozen for 2 days. In addition, the influence of brushing teeth and feeding on the detection of the virus in saliva was addressed. Finally, the efficiency of saliva in revealing the presence of the virus during the hospitalization period was determined in children. Results The viral genome was consistently detected regardless of the storage conditions of saliva samples. Brushing teeth and feeding did not influence the sensitivity of the test. In hospitalized children, positive results were obtained only during the early days. Conclusions These results support the idea of the use of saliva as an alternative specimen for diagnostic testing for COVID-19. The viral genome is stable and endures perturbations in the oral cavity. However, clearance of the virus from the mouth during the infection may limit the use of the test only to the early stages of the disease.;"https://doi.org/10.24875/bmhim.20000204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064678/";1/1/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9313

The main purpose of this review is to analyze data from studies where CAVI is used to test the arterial wall stiffness in magistral vessels. CAVI measurement is non-invasive and performed by portable devices which makes it comfortable for ambulatory use in patients who come for a check-up and also in those who already are hospitalized. It does not require any special knowledge from investigator and the test lasts a couple of minutes long. CAVI does not depend on blood pressure changes and is more specific in structural changes of arterial wall assessment than brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). CAVI shows considerable correlation with markers of CVD like atherosclerotic plaques in vessels, diastolic disfunction of left ventricle and angina pectoris. CAVI may be used for early monitoring and assessing the lesions of target organs in patients with atherosclerosis, chronic hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Establishing CAVI as a standart parameter in assessing patients who are at risk of CVD can help to improve complications prevention, reduce mortality and prolong their lifespan.;"https://doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2021.01.200599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720632/";10/1/2021;cardio-ankle vascular index;0.9198

Even when carefully planned for and continuously critically reflected upon, conflicts are likely to occur as part of the process. This paper illustrates the lessons learned from “Building on Strengths in Naujaat”, a resiliency initiative with the objective of promoting sense of belonging, collective efficacy, and well-being in Inuit youth. Naujaat community members over time established strong meaningful relationships with academic researchers. Youth took on the challenge of organizing community events, trips out on the land, and fundraisers. While their creativity and resourcefulness are at the heart of the initiative, this paper explores conflicts and pitfalls that accompanied it. Based on three themes – struggles in coming together as academic and community partners, the danger of perpetuating colonial power structures, and the challenges of navigating complex layers of relations within the community – we examine the dilemmas unearthed by these conflicts, including an exploration of how much we as CBPR researchers are at risk of reproducing colonial power structures. Acknowledging and addressing power imbalances, while striving for transparency, accountability, and trust, are compelling guiding principles needed to support Indigenous communities on the road toward health equity.;"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.604668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777879/";12/3/2021;Community-based participatory research;0.9395

1977;A Multistakeholder-Centric Data Analytics Governance Framework for Medication Adherence and Improvement in Rural Settings;10.1007/978-3-030-45002-1_35;Good medication adherence is directly proportional to good health recovery and general improvement of a patient’s health condition. Although many good medication adherence monitoring methods/techniques exist, the level of medication adherence for some chronic diseases by patients in rural settings is still suboptimal. Hence, the need for healthcare organisations to devise viable governance frameworks that will facilitate effective medication adherence monitoring and improved adherence by patients. This paper presents the conceptual overview of a governance framework for medication adherence monitoring and improvement that enables the collaboration of multiple stakeholders and data analytics (MUCODAF) in support of the patient in the treatment journey. The framework allows relevant stakeholders such as Healthcare workers (HCW), family members, and close friends to collaborate in support of a patient through the engagement of critical human factors such as empathy, motivation, encouragement, flexibility, and negotiation. The use cases of the framework, its technical composition, and the implementation plan are discussed in this paper. A concrete example of the application of the governance framework for medication adherence monitoring and improvement for a Tuberculosis patient in the African Country of Lesotho is presented to highlight the plausibility of the framework.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134227/;10/3/2020;Healthcare workers;0.9917

On 29th April 2020, Malaysia reported more than 5,000 COVID-19 cases; the second highest in the Southeast Asian region after Singapore. Recently, a forecasting model was developed to measure and predict COVID-19 cases in Malaysia on daily basis for the next 10 days using previously-confirmed cases. A Recurrent Forecasting-Singular Spectrum Analysis (RF-SSA) is proposed by establishing L and ET parameters via several tests. The advantage of using this forecasting model is it would discriminate noise in a time series trend and produce significant forecasting results. The RF-SSA model assessment was based on the official COVID-19 data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) to predict daily confirmed cases between 30th April and 31st May, 2020. These results revealed that parameter L = 5 (T/20) for the RF-SSA model was indeed suitable for short-time series outbreak data, while the appropriate number of eigentriples was integral as it influenced the forecasting results. Evidently, the RF-SSA had over-forecasted the cases by 0.36%. This signifies the competence of RF-SSA in predicting the impending number of COVID-19 cases.

In particular, older persons tend to suffer more severely when infected with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and have higher case mortality rates; additionally, outbreaks frequently occur in hospitals and long-term care facilities where most of the residents are older persons. Unfortunately, it has been stated that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a medical collapse in some countries, resulting in the depletion of medical resources, such as ventilators, and triage based on chronological age. Furthermore, as some COVID-19 cases show a rapid deterioration of clinical symptoms and accordingly, the medical and long-term care staff cannot always confirm the patient's values and wishes in time, we are very concerned as to whether older patients are receiving the medical and long-term care services that they wish for. It was once again recognized that it is vital to implement advance care planning as early as possible before suffering from COVID-19.

To understand the differences between antibody responses in mild versus severe cases of COVID-19, we analyzed the B cell responses in patients 1.5 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe and not mild infection correlated with high titers of IgG against Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that were capable of viral inhibition. B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing revealed two VH genes, VH3–38 and VH3–53, that were enriched during severe infection. Of the 22 antibodies cloned from two severe donors, six exhibited potent neutralization against live SARS-CoV-2, and inhibited syncytia formation. Using peptide libraries, competition ELISA and RBD mutagenesis, we mapped the epitopes of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to three different sites on the Spike. Finally, we used combinations of nAbs targeting different immune-sites to efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of 49 healthy BCR repertoires revealed that the nAbs germline VHJH precursors comprise up to 2.7% of all VHJHs. We demonstrate that severe COVID-19 is associated with unique BCR signatures and multi-clonal neutralizing responses that are relatively frequent in the population.

The current study conducted a national online survey among vulnerable populations in China in early February 2020 to examine their engagement in coronavirus-related preventive health behaviors (e.g., frequent handwashing) and the potential determinants including factors from the Health Belief Model, trust in different media sources, and health literacy. The results suggested that the vulnerable populations' engagement in coronavirus-related preventive behaviors were significantly associated with barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, trust in doctors' social media, and trust in TV for COVID-19-related information. Besides, barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, trust in doctors' social media, and trust in TV mediated the effects of health literacy on preventive behaviors. Our findings provided directions for future health promotions and interventions targeting vulnerable populations to enhance their preventive behaviors in China.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1880684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557620/";8/2/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9624
1982;Predictive Value of Respiratory Viral Detection in the Upper Respiratory Tract for Infection of the Lower Respiratory Tract With Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation;10.1093/infdis/jiz470;"BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients are frequently infected with respiratory viruses (RVs) in the upper respiratory tract (URT), but the concordance between URT and lower respiratory tract (LRT) RV detection is not well characterized. METHODS: Hematopoietic cell transplant candidates and recipients with respiratory symptoms and LRT and URT RV testing via multiplex PCR from 2009 to 2016 were included. Logistic regression models were used to analyze risk factors for LRT RV detection. RESULTS: Two-hundred thirty-five HCT candidates or recipients had URT and LRT RV testing within 3 days. Among 115 subjects (49%) positive for a RV, 37% (42 of 115) had discordant sample pairs. Forty percent (17 of 42) of discordant pairs were positive in the LRT but negative in the URT. Discordance was common for adenovirus (100%), metapneumovirus (44%), rhinovirus (34%), and parainfluenza virus type 3 (28%); respiratory syncytial virus was highly concordant (92%). Likelihood of LRT detection was increased with URT detection (oods ratio [OR] = 73.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26.7–204) and in cytomegalovirus-positive recipients (OR = 3.70; 95% CI, 1.30–10.0). CONCLUSIONS: High rates of discordance were observed for certain RVs.

Three constructed wetland configurations including Typha angustifolia planted with enhanced atmospheric aeration by using perforated pipes networks (CWA), planted without perforated pipe network (CWR), and a control non-planted and without perforated pipes wetland (Control) were used in the study. Changes in physicochemical properties and microbial community over four seasons and hydraulic loading rate (HLR) (50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 L day-1 m-1) were monitored using influent from Marriott Lake in Egypt. Overall, the removal performance followed the sequence CWA>CWR>control. Turbidity removal of 98.4%; biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) removal of 83.3%; chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 95.8%; NH3-N removal of 99.9%; total nitrogen (TN) removal of 94.7%; NO3--N and NO2--N increased; total P (TP) removal of 99.7%, Vibrio sp. of 100%, Escherichia coli 100%; total bacterial count of 92.3%; and anaerobic bacteria reduction of 97.5% were achieved by using CWA.

1984;ASSESSING THE AGE SPECIFICITY OF INFECTION FATALITY RATES FOR COVID-19: META-ANALYSIS & PUBLIC POLICY IMPLICATIONS;10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895;This paper assesses the age specificity of the infection fatality rate (IFR) for COVID-19. Our benchmark meta-regression synthesizes the age-specific IFRs from four recent large-scale seroprevalence studies conducted in Belgium, Geneva, Spain, and Sweden. The estimated IFR is close to zero for children and younger adults but rises exponentially with age, reaching about 0.3 percent for ages 50-59, 1 percent for ages 60-69, 4 percent for ages 70-79, and 24 percent for ages 80 and above. We compare those predictions to the age-specific IFRs computed using recent seroprevalence studies of six U.S. geographical areas, three countries that have engaged in comprehensive tracking and tracing of COVID-19 infections, and three small-scale seroprevalence studies. We also review more than 30 other seroprevalence studies whose design was not well-suited for estimating age-specific IFRs. Our findings indicate that COVID-19 is not just dangerous for the elderly and infirm but also for healthy middle-aged adults, for whom the fatality rate is roughly 50 times greater than the risk of dying in an automobile accident. Consequently, the overall IFR for a given location is intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. In a scenario where the U.S. infection rate reaches nearly 30%, our analysis indicates that protecting vulnerable age groups could prevent over 200,000 deaths.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.23.20160895v1?rss=1";24/7/2020;infection fatality rate;0.9082
1985;Trust, Connection and Equity: Can Understanding Context Help to Establish Successful Campus Community Gardens?;10.3390/ijerph17207476;"Campus community gardens (CCGs) can potentially improve student health and wellbeing, mitigate social and ecological problems, and nurture university-community relationships. However, CCGs are located in complex socio-political and ecological settings and many community gardens struggle or fail. However, few studies have assessed the socio-political/ecological context of a garden setting prior to its development to understand the potential barriers and enablers of success. Our study assessed the socio-spatial context of a proposed CCG at a student university accommodation site. We engaged diverse university and community stakeholders through interviews, focus groups and a survey to explore their perceptions of the space generally and the proposed garden specifically. Visual observations and public life surveying were used to determine patterns of behavior. Results confirmed known problems associated with an underutilized site that provides little opportunity for lingering or contact with nature; and unknown barriers, including socially disconnected stakeholders and community distrust of the university. The research also uncovered positive enablers, such as stakeholder appreciation of the social, wellbeing and ecological benefits that a CCG could deliver. Our findings suggest that an in-depth exploration of a proposed garden context can be an important enabler of its success.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7602408/;14/10/2020;Campus community gardens;0.9618
1986;Venous Thromboembolism among Critically Ill Children: A Narrative Review.;10.1055/s-0041-1722847;Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients, including children. In recent years, it has become clear that hospitalization and critical illness bestow an increased VTE risk in pediatrics and relate to mortality and life-limiting comorbidities. For critically ill children, reported rates of VTE vary by study sampling techniques, presence of inherited or acquired thrombophilia, acute and chronic immobility, underlying illness prompting hospitalization, and clinical factors related to illness severity such as central venous catheterization, length of stay, mechanical ventilation, and patient age. Accordingly, critically ill children with new signs of venous congestion, acute inflammation, or unexplained acute organ dysfunction should be routinely evaluated for VTE. This narrative review summarizes recent and historical literature regarding risk factors, prevention, presentation, treatment, and outcomes of VTE in critically ill children. In addition, we identify knowledge gaps and priorities for future collaborative research on this vital condition. Special attention is given to the clinical trial opportunities, challenges, and ongoing efforts in thromboprophylaxis in critically ill children, including those hospitalized for disease related to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and multisystem inflammatory disease in children.;"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1722847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34058768/";31/5/2021;coronavirus;0.91
1987;Innovations with tele-ultrasound in education sonography: the use of tele-ultrasound to train novice scanners;10.1186/s13089-021-00210-0;OBJECTIVES: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has become increasingly integrated into medical education given the growing role of evaluative and procedural techniques in practice today. Tele-ultrasound is a new and promising venture that aims to expand medical knowledge and education to previously unreached or underserved areas. This study aimed to determine the non-inferiority of teaching ultrasound remotely using tele-ultrasound via the Philips Lumify (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, WA) system, which utilizes video conferencing technology and real-time imaging that can be viewed by the operator and educator simultaneously. METHODS: Three commonly used ultrasound exams were taught and evaluated in 56 ultrasound-naive medical participants: Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST), Lower Extremity Deep Venous Thrombosis (LEDVT) screening, and ultrasound-guided vascular access. The participants were randomized into either in-person traditional learning or tele-ultrasound learning with the Philips Lumify (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, WA) units. The primary outcome of interest was the ability to perform certain tasks for each exam RESULTS: Competency on each exam was tested across all exams and no inferiority was found between in-person and remote learning (p < 0.05).

1988;Containment to outbreak tipping points in COVID-19;10.1101/2020.09.14.20194159;Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been a cornerstone in managing emergent diseases such as COVID-191-4. However, despite their potential to contain or attenuate the epidemic, the effects of NPIs on disease dynamics are not well understood1,5-7. We show that saturation of NPIs with the increase in infected individuals, an expected consequence of limited contact tracing and healthcare capacities, produces a positive feedback in the disease growth rate and a threshold between two alternative states--containment and outbreak8. These alternative states were previously related with the strength of NPIs but not with the infection number2,9-11. Furthermore, the transition between these states involves an abrupt acceleration in disease dynamics, which we report here for several COVID-19 outbreaks around the world. The consequences of a positive feedback in population dynamics at low numbers is a phenomenon widely studied in ecology--the Allee effect. This effect is a determinant of extinction-outbreak states, geographic synchronization, spatial spread, and the effect of exogenous variables, as vaccination12-15. As countries are relaxing containing measures, recognizing an NPI-induced Allee effect may be essential for deploying containment strategies within and among countries16 and acknowledges the need for early warning indicators of approaching epidemic tipping points17.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.14.20194159; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20194159v1?rss=1";15/9/2020;Non-pharmaceutical interventions;0.9303
1989;Association of COVID-19 with skin diseases and relevant biologics: a cross-sectional study using nationwide claim data in South Korea.;10.1111/bjd.19507;BACKGROUND As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread, information about COVID-19 and skin disease or related biologics is still lacking. OBJECTIVE We aimed to identify the association between COVID-19 and skin diseases or biologics. METHOD A nationwide claim dataset relevant to COVID-19 in South Korea was analysed. This dataset included insurance claim data before and during COVID-19 treatment and clinical outcomes. Claim data related to skin diseases and relevant biologics were analysed to figure out the association of COVID-19 with skin diseases and relevant biologics. RESULTS The dataset contained a total of 234,427 (M/F: 111,947/122,480) subjects who underwent COVID-19 testing. Of them, 7,590 (3.2%) were confirmed as COVID-19 (+), and 227 (3.0%) confirmed patients died. Amongst various skin diseases and biologics, no significant increase in the presence of specific skin diseases or exposure to biologics was observed in the COVID-19 (+) group, even after adjusting for or matching covariates. The presence of skin diseases and exposure to biologics also did not seem to affect clinical outcomes including mortality. CONCLUSIONS Underlying skin diseases did not appear to increase susceptibility to COVID-19 or mortality from COVID-19.

Gold nanoparticles (GNP) of average size 12 nm were synthesized by citrate reduction method followed by functionalization with cysteamine hydrochloride for nano-conjugation. Immune response of nano-conjugates of GNP with 26 kDa protein (368-606 amino acids) and 54 kDa protein (112-606 amino acids) were evaluated. In vitro release kinetics of GNP-conjugated 54 kDa (GNP54) and 26 kDa (GNP26) proteins showed slower rate of release of 54 kDa protein as compared to 26 kDa protein. Humoral immune response of mice immunized intramuscularly with GNP54, GNP26 and GNP alone, exhibited HEV-specific IgG titer of 7.9 ± 2.9, 5.686 ± 4.098 and 0.698 ± 0.089, respectively, after 14 days of booster immunization. In addition to this, HEV-specific cell-mediated immune response was demonstrated by splenocyte proliferation assay. Analysis of results using one-way ANOVA, showed statistically significant (p value < 0.05) increase in splenocyte proliferation for GNP54- and GNP26-immunized mice in comparison to GNP alone immunized mice. Stimulation index of HEV ORF2 proteins in GNP54/GNP26-immunized mice were comparable to Concanavalin A-treated positive control. These results indicate GNP-based vaccine as a promising candidate for efficiently mediating both humoral and cell-mediated immune response against HEV.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7799426/;11/1/2021;booster immunization;0.9488

1993;Vaping induced pneumonitis: a small community hospital’s case series and analysis;10.1186/s12890-020-1158-2;BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes/e-cigarettes (ECs), or vaping, is currently the most popular form of smoking amongst youth in the United States. ECs are battery-powered devices that vaporize a liquid that comes in small cartridges, or pods, that contain various chemicals, nicotine, and an array of flavors that can be modified to include cannabinoids (THC). With increasing popularity, however, there is an epidemic of pulmonary and gastrointestinal illnesses associated with vaping in the continental U.S.A. METHODS: We analyzed medical charts of three patients who were active users of ECs and presented with pneumonitis to our community medical center between January and August 2019. RESULTS: We report three cases of vaping pneumonitis in young adults, ages 18 to 21, who presented with similar symptoms, profiles, imaging studies, and disease progression. The average length of stay was approximately one week, and all patients had an extensive work-up in addition to a relapsing and remitting course of their condition. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and diagnosis of vaping pneumonitis are essential in the treatment of the ongoing epidemic. Extensive unnecessary work up may lead to increased healthcare costs. Our case series echoes the concerns of the CDC such that ECs should be avoided, and those with any pulmonary or gastrointestinal symptoms should seek medical attention promptly.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197363/;4/5/2020;Electronic cigarettes/e-cigarettes;0.9066

The patient was taken to cesarean by providing isolation conditions, and she had a healthy baby with an uncomplicated delivery. There are no certain data about whether COVID-19 infection is worse in pregnant patients or not. On the basis of the limited data in the literature, we cannot see intrauterine transmission from infected mother to baby. However, we know that there would be serious pulmonary complications for the infected mother.

1997;Use of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) in Chronic Airway Diseases;10.3390/cells9102210;Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a key component of the extracellular matrix of the lungs. A unique attribute of HA is its water-retaining properties, so HA has a major role in the regulation of fluid balance in the lung interstitium. Hyaluronic acid has been widely used in the treatment of eyes, ears, joints and skin disorders, but in the last years, it has been also proposed in the treatment of certain lung diseases, including airway diseases, due to its anti-inflammatory and water-binding capacities. Hyaluronic acid aerosol decreases the severity of elastase-induced emphysema in murine models, prevents bronchoconstriction in asthmatics and improves some functional parameters in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Due to the protection of HA against bronchoconstriction and its hydration properties, inhaled HA would increase the volume of airway surface liquid, resulting in mucus hydration, increased mucous transport and less mucous plugging of the airways. In addition, it has been seen in human studies that the treatment with nebulised HA improves the tolerability of nebulised hypertonic saline (even at 6% or 7% of concentration), which has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment in bronchial secretion management in patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Our objective is to review the role of HA treatment in the management of chronic airway diseases.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7601363/;29/9/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9144

1999;Laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy using the transfissural Glissonean approach.;10.1007/s00423-020-01889-w;BACKGROUND Anatomical segmentectomy is a technically difficult procedure owing to the complexity of the segmental anatomy of the liver. In the conventional Glissonean approach from the liver hilum, the tertiary portal pedicles may be difficult to dissect because of their anatomical variations and deep location. We present a technique of purely laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy of the liver using the transfissural Glissonean approach. METHODS We performed purely laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy using the transfissural Glissonean approach. This approach involved initially opening the liver parenchyma along the fissure line (main portal, right portal, and umbilical fissures). Thereafter, the target tertiary portal pedicles were approached and ligated within the liver parenchyma above the liver hilum. RESULTS Between August 2014 and September 2019, we performed 17 cases of laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy using the transfissural Glissonean approach. The median operative time was 200 min (range 120-310 min), and the intraoperative blood loss was 80 mL (range 30-280 mL). The median postoperative hospital stay was 6 days (range 3-9 days). There was no major morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION The transfissural Glissonean approach in laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy is technically feasible because opening the fissure allows direct access to the tertiary portal pedicles.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-020-01889-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388715/";9/5/2020;Anatomical segmentectomy;0.9484

Furthermore, we studied a total of 1,000 individuals, who were 667 'healthy' (195 healthcare workers and 472 hospitalized patients with other disorders than COVID-19 infection) individuals and 333 infection-suspected patients with cough and fever, were tested. Results Serial dilution analysis showed the limit of detection of around 10-100 copies according to National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan. Spike-in experiment demonstrated RT-qPCR detect positive signal in pooling samples of SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive patient at the 5-, 10-, 20-fold dilution. By screening with pooling strategy by the end of April, 2020, there are 12 COVID-19 patients in 333 infection suspected patients (3.6%) and zero in 667 'healthy'. We obtained these results with total running 538 times (instead of 1,000 times) by pooling strategy. Conclusion Pooling samples is feasible for saving test reagents and detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical setting to prevent the spread of the virus and nosocomial transmission.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20088146; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20088146v1?rss=1";6/5/2020;19 infection;0.9661
2001;Toothpastes with Enzymes Support Gum Health and Reduce Plaque Formation;10.3390/ijerph18020835;"Enzymes in toothpastes can support host immune responses, and thus maintain oral health. This study aimed to investigate gingival health and the plaque-reducing effects of enzyme-containing toothpastes. A laboratory study tested the antimicrobial potential of different enzyme-containing toothpaste formulations. Two promising formulations (enzyme-containing toothpastes with glucose oxidase and D-glucose with (C+) and without Citrox (C−) Citrox) were investigated in a clinical crossover trial (two slurries: sodium lauryl sulfate-containing (SLS), a toothpaste without SLS (reference), and water). Subjects (n = 20) abstained from toothbrushing for four days and rinsed with a toothpaste slurry. Bleeding on probing (BOP) and plaque indices (PI) were measured. A mixed linear model was used to statistically compare the slurries with respect to BOP and PI change. The in vitro bacterial growth-inhibiting evaluation showed the best results for SLS, followed by C+ and C−. The change in BOP and PI exhibited statistically significant differences to water rinsing (BOP; PI changes in % points (difference of the baseline and post-rinse values: water = 8.8%; 90.0%; C+ = −1.4%; 80.4%; SLS = 1.5%; 72.1%; reference = 0.8%; 77.5%; C− = −1.8%; 75.1%).

2002;Duration of SARS-CoV-2 Sero-Positivity in a Large Longitudinal Sero-Surveillance Cohort: The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership;10.1101/2021.01.27.21250615;Background: Estimating population prevalence and incidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to formulate public health recommendations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. However, interpreting estimates based on sero-surveillance requires an understanding of the duration of elevated antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the large number of people with pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Methods: We examined >30,000 serology assays for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM assays acquired longitudinally in 11,468 adults between April and November 2020 in the COVID-19 Community Research Partnership. Findings: Among participants with serologic evidence for infection but few or no symptoms or clinical disease, roughly 50% sero-reverted in 30 days of their initial positive test. Sero-reversion occurred more quickly for IgM than IgG and for antibodies targeting nucleocapsid protein compared with spike proteins, but was not associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, or healthcare worker status. Interpretation: The short duration of antibody response suggests that the true population prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly higher than presumed based on earlier sero-surveillance studies. The impact of the large number of minimally symptomatic COVID-19 cases with only a brief antibody response on population immunity remains to be determined.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250615; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250615v1?rss=1";29/1/2021;Community Research Partnership;0.9383

Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is close to Amraz-e-Wabai (epidemic diseases) which was described by Hippocrates, Galen, Aristotle, Razes, Haly Abbas, Avicenna, Jurjani etc. Presently, there is no specific or challenging treatment available for COVID-19. Renowned Unani Scholars recommended during epidemic situation to stay at home, and fumigate the shelters with aromatics herbs like Ood kham (Aquilaria agallocha Roxb.), Kundur (Boswellia serrata Roxb), Kafoor (Cinnamomum camphora L.), Sandal (Santalum album L), Hing (Ferula foetida L.) etc. Use of specific Unani formulations are claimed effective for the management of such epidemic or pandemic situation like antidotes (Tiryaqe Wabai, Tiryaqe Arba, Tiryaqe Azam, Gile Armani), Herbal Decoction (Joshandah), along with Sharbate Khaksi, Habbe Bukhar, Sharbate Zanjabeel, Khamira Marwareed, Jawarish Jalinus, and Sirka (vinegar).

COVID-19 is caused by a novel virus SARS-CoV2 (2019-nCoV), against which there is currently no vaccine available; and current antiviral therapies have failed, causing a very high mortality rate. Drug repurposing i.e. utilizing an approved drug for different indication, offers a time- and cost-efficient alternative for making new therapies available to patients. Although there are several reports presenting novel approaches to treat COVID-19, still an attentive review of previous scientific literature is essential to overcome their failure to exhibit efficacy. There is an urgent need to provide a comprehensive outlook toward utilizing drug repurposing as a tool for discovery of new therapies against COVID-19. In this article, we aim to provide a to-the-point review of current literature regarding efficacy of repurposed drugs against COVID-19 and other respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses. We have briefly discussed COVID-19 epidemiology, and then have discussed drug repurposing approaches and examples, specific to respiratory viruses.

2005;Learning from and Leveraging Multi-Level Changes in Responses to the COVID 19 Pandemic to Facilitate Breast Cancer Prevention Efforts.;10.3390/ijerph18136999;The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has had multilevel effects on non-COVID-19 health and health care, including deferral of routine cancer prevention and screening and delays in surgical and other procedures. Health and health care use has also been affected by pandemic-related loss of employer-based health insurance, food and housing disruptions, and heightened stress, sleep disruptions and social isolation. These disruptions are projected to contribute to excess non-COVID-19 deaths over the coming decades. At the same time municipalities, health systems and individuals are making changes in response to the pandemic, including modifications in the environmental to promote health, implementation of telehealth platforms, and shifts towards greater self-care and using remote platforms to maintain social connections. We used a multi-level biopsychosocial model to examine the available literature on the relationship between COVID-19-related changes and breast cancer prevention to identify current gaps in knowledge and identify potential opportunities for future research. We found that COVID-19 has impacted several aspects of social and economic life, through a variety of mechanisms, including unemployment, changes in health care delivery, changes in eating and activity, and changes in mental health. Some of these changes should be reduced, while others should be explored and enhanced.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208878/";30/6/2021;coronavirus pandemic;0.9132
2006;Emergence From the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic and the Care of Chronic Pain: Guidance for the Interventionalist;10.1213/ane.0000000000005000;BACKGROUND: The current Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to a significant disruption in the care of pain from chronic and subacute conditions. The impact of this cessation of pain treatment may have unintended consequences of increased pain, reduced function, increased reliance on opioid medications, and potential increased morbidity, due to the systemic impact of untreated disease burden. This may include decreased mobility, reduction in overall health status, and increase of opioid use with the associated risks. METHODS: The article is the study of the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) COVID-19 task force to evaluate the policies set forth by federal, state, and local agencies to reduce or eliminate elective procedures for those patients with pain from spine, nerve, and joint disease. The impact of these decisions, which were needed to reduce the spread of the pandemic, led to a delay in care for many patients. We hence review an emergence plan to reinitiate this pain-related care. The goal is to outline a path to work with federal, state, and local authorities to combat the spread of the pandemic and minimize the deleterious impact of pain and suffering on our chronic pain patients. RESULTS: The article sets forth a strategy for the interventional pain centers to reemerge from the current pandemic and to set a course for future events.

Here we studied a prospective cohort of individuals with long COVID (the ADAPT study) compared to age/gender matched subjects without long COVID, healthy donors and individuals infected with other non-SARS CoV2 human coronaviruses (the ADAPT-C study). We found an elevated diffuse serum inflammatory cytokine profile in symptomatic long COVID subjects that was maintained at 8 months post-infection and was not observed in asymptomatic COVID-19 survivors. This inflammatory profile consisted of 15 cytokines that positively correlated; revealing an apparent diffuse, potentially coordinated, low level up regulation of a spectrum of immune and inflammatory mediators. In addition, we found an absence of subsets of un-activated naive T and B cells in peripheral blood of long COVID subjects, that did not reconstitute over time. In contrast, individual serum cytokines from the interferon I and III classes, T cell activation markers and plasma ACE2, while elevated in the serum of people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were not further elevated in subjects with long COVID symptoms.

2008;Advances in immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma;10.1038/s41575-021-00438-0;Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent disease with a progression that is modulated by the immune system. Systemic therapy is used in the advanced stage and until 2017 consisted only of antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has shown strong anti-tumour activity in a subset of patients and the combination of the anti-PDL1 antibody atezolizumab and the VEGF-neutralizing antibody bevacizumab has or will soon become the standard of care as a first-line therapy for HCC, whereas the anti-PD1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab are used after TKIs in several regions. Other immune strategies such as adoptive T-cell transfer, vaccination or virotherapy have not yet demonstrated consistent clinical activity. Major unmet challenges in HCC checkpoint immunotherapy are the discovery and validation of predictive biomarkers, advancing treatment to earlier stages of the disease, applying the treatment to patients with liver dysfunction and the discovery of more effective combinatorial or sequential approaches. Combinations with other systemic or local treatments are perceived as the most promising opportunities in HCC and some are already under evaluation in large-scale clinical trials.

2010;Gains and Losses in Virtual Mentorship: A Descriptive Case Study of Undergraduate Mentees and Graduate Mentors in STEM Research during the COVID-19 Pandemic.;10.1187/cbe.20-06-0128;Participating in mentored undergraduate research experiences can improve students' grade point averages, retention, and job placement. Graduate students also benefit from serving as mentors, as they gain teaching and research management experience. In early 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic caused many institutions to shut down physical work spaces and move research and teaching online. In this study, we explore how graduate student mentors and undergraduate student mentees at Washington University in St. Louis adapted to virtual research mentoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined changes in mentoring methods, research productivity, and the impact on the future plans of both mentors and mentees across six science/engineering departments. Survey responses from 79 mentees and 38 mentors indicated that a majority of mentees were able to have meaningful and productive virtual mentoring experiences, while other mentors failed to adequately involve their mentees in continued mentoring. Focusing virtual research experiences on activities such as literature review and data analysis and collaborating on goal setting can serve as a way for mentors to engage mentees even when they are unable to access lab equipment. Data from the present study reveal opportunities and challenges of virtual mentoring and can be used to inform effective research mentoring practices in the future.;"https://doi.org/10.1187/cbe.20-06-0128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734867/";1/6/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.9621
2011;Resveratrol extracted from Chinese herbal medicines: A novel therapeutic strategy for lung diseases;10.1016/j.chmed.2020.07.003;Lung diseases and their related complications represent a critical source of morbidity and mortality globally and have become a research focus in recent years. There are plenty of hazards that threaten the health of lung by exposure to external environmental stimuli, such as dust, cigarette smoke, PM2.5, air pollution and pathogen infection. These risks lead to the impairment of lung function and subsequent lung diseases including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Compared with antibiotics and corticosteroids therapies, traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions are more effective with fewer side effects. A considerable variety of bioactive ingredients have been extracted and identified from Chinese herbal medicines and are used for the treatment of different lung diseases, including resveratrol. Increasing studies have reported promising therapeutic effects of resveratrol against lung diseases by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation, aging, fibrosis and cancer both in vitro and in vivo. In this review, the recent progress in the studies of lung-protective effects and underlying mechanisms of resveratrol and also highlight the potency of resveratrol and traditional Chinese prescriptions containing resveratrol as promising therapeutic options were summarized for the treatment of lung and respiratory diseases.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674638420300897?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chmed.2020.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32963508/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1674638420300897";18/9/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9685
2012;COVID-19 pandemic and troponin: indirect myocardial injury, myocardial inflammation or myocarditis?;10.1136/heartjnl-2020-317186;The initial mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of ACE2, which is mainly expressed in the lung. Since the heart and the vessels also express ACE2, they both could become targets of the virus. However, at present the extent and importance of this potential involvement are unknown. Cardiac troponin levels are significantly higher in patients with more severe infections, patients admitted to intensive care units or in those who have died. In the setting of COVID-19, myocardial injury, defined by an increased troponin level, occurs especially due to non-ischaemic myocardial processes, including severe respiratory infection with hypoxia, sepsis, systemic inflammation, pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, cardiac adrenergic hyperstimulation during cytokine storm syndrome, and myocarditis. At present, there are limited reports on definite diagnosis of myocarditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans and limited demonstration of the virus in the myocardium. In conclusion, although the heart and the vessels are potential targets in COVID-19, there is currently limited evidence on the direct infection of the myocardium by SARS-CoV-2. Additional pathological studies and autopsy series will be very helpful to clarify the potentiality of COVID-19 to directly infect the myocardium and cause myocarditis.;"https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2020-317186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32499236/";4/6/2020;myocardial injury;0.9115

2014;Capturing the Spatial Relatedness of Long-Distance Caregiving: A Mixed-Methods Approach;10.3390/ijerph17176406;Long-distance caregiving (LDC) is an issue of growing importance in the context of assessing the future of elder care and the maintenance of health and well-being of both the cared-for persons and the long-distance caregivers. Uncertainty in the international discussion relates to the relevance of spatially related aspects referring to the burdens of the long-distance caregiver and their (longer-term) willingness and ability to provide care for their elderly relatives. This paper is the result of a first attempt to operationalize and comprehensively analyze the spatial relatedness of long-distance caregiving against the background of the international literature by combining a longitudinal single case study of long-distance caregiving person and semantic hierarchies. In the cooperation of spatial sciences and geoinformatics an analysis grid based on a graph-theoretical model was developed. The elaborated conceptual framework should stimulate a more detailed and precise interdisciplinary discussion on the spatial relatedness of long-distance caregiving and, thus, is open for further refinement in order to become a decision-support tool for policy-makers responsible for social and elder care and health promotion. Moreover, it may serve as a starting point for the development of a method for the numerical determination of the long-distance caregivers on different spatial reference scales.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887508/";2/9/2020;Long-distance caregiving;0.9853
2015;Online Identity Theft on Consumer Purchase Intention: A Mediating Role of Online Security and Privacy Concern;10.1007/978-3-030-45002-1_13;This study measures the influence of fear of financial loss (FOFL), fear of reputational damage (FORD), with the mediating effect of online security and privacy concern (OSPCON) towards online purchase intentions in an emerging economy’s context. Data was conveniently collected from University students of four of the public higher institutions in Ghana. Out of the 201 questionnaires distributed, 179 were eligible for analysis. A Quantitative methodological approach was adopted which relied on the Partial Least Square approach to Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) for the statistical analysis. Seemingly, FOFL and FORD constructs were not seen to be a significant direct predictor of online purchase intention. However, the mediating effect of OSPCON for both FOFL and FORD towards online purchase intention in the Ghanaian context was found to be significant, hence the mediated-hypotheses were supported. Nonetheless, we have highlighted the need for additional and further research taking a cue from the study’s limitations. The study contributes to our knowledge of how online identity theft practices lead to the unwillingness of online customers to embark on online transactions in an emerging economy, given the rampant outburst of online transactions in the developed world. The originality of this study is in the fact that it focuses on an emerging economy, which is under-researched.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134379/;10/3/2020;fear of reputational damage;0.9423

2019;A Comprehensive Review of Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Major Mental and Neurological Disorders and Suicide: A Biostatistical Perspective on Data Mining;10.3390/diagnostics11030393;The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that mental disorders, neurological disorders, and suicide are growing causes of morbidity. Depressive disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, and other dementias account for 1.84%, 0.60%, 0.33%, and 1.00% of total Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Furthermore, suicide, the 15th leading cause of death worldwide, could be linked to mental disorders. More than 68 computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods published in peer-reviewed journals from 2016 to 2021 were analyzed, among which 75% were published in the year 2018 or later. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was adopted to select the relevant studies. In addition to the gold standard, the sample size, neuroimaging techniques or biomarkers, validation frameworks, the classifiers, and the performance indices were analyzed. We further discussed how various performance indices are essential based on the biostatistical and data mining perspective.

2020;Increased alpha-helicity of a supercharged coiled-coil protein increases siRNA delivery efficiency of protein-lipid hybrid vehicle;10.1101/2021.05.03.442303;Gene therapy has the potential to treat various diseases and has recently gained new interest due to the deployment nucleic acid based vaccines for COVID-19. Despite these developments, there still remains a need for further development of gene delivery vehicles to increase their safety and efficacy.. We have recently developed a lipoproteoplex (LPP) consisting of a super-charged coiled-coil protein (CSP) and a cationic liposomal carrier, that has the ability to condense nucleic acids and deliver them in vivo. The LPP is distinct from other liposomal gene delivery systems in that it utilizes a modular protein component to drive transfection activity as opposed to relying on the passive effects of the cationic lipids. A CSP library has been rationally designed to improve the efficacy of the LPP compared to the parent protein via improved alpha-helical structure and increased nucleic acid binding through the use of extended histidine tags and increased positive charge. The secondary structure and nucleic acid binding ability of each library member was assessed, then compared to functional transfection data in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Structural and functional data suggests that increasing alpha-helicity of the protein component of the LPP compared to the parent sequence doubles nucleic acid binding affinity and increases transfection activity almost 3-fold with a favorable safety profile.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.03.442303;4/5/2021;nucleic acid based vaccines;0.9481
2021;Clinical significance of changes in serum inflammatory factors in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary infection;10.1177/03000605211013275;BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often accompanied by pulmonary infection, inflammatory responses, decreased immunity, and decreased lung function. The relationships among the pulmonary inflammation index (PII), lung function, and immunity in COPD patients with pulmonary infection remain unclear. METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled 234 participants (patients with COPD and pulmonary infection, patients with COPD without pulmonary infection, and healthy individuals) from January 2017 to December 2019. RESULTS: Levels of interleukin (IL)-6 were lower and levels of IL-8 were higher in patients with COPD and pulmonary infection. Levels of white blood cells (WBCs), C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and CD8+ cells were higher, while levels of CD3+ and CD4+ cells, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1 % predicted (FEV1%pred), and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) (FEV1%FVC) were lower in patients with COPD and pulmonary infection. Levels of WBCs, CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α were negatively associated with FEV1, FEV1%pred and FEV1%FVC. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD and pulmonary infection have high PIIs, decreased immunity, and poor lung function. PII is closely related to lung function and may represent a useful biomarker for the assessment of patients with COPD and pulmonary infection.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/03000605211013275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34018839/";21/5/2021;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.986
2022;Dental Pain, Parental SARS‐Cov2 Fear and Distress on Quality of Life of 2‐6‐Year‐Old Children During COVID‐19;10.1111/ipd.12757;"BACKGROUND: Corona virus disease (COVID‐19) has crippled life, families and oral health care delivery in India due to nation wide lockdown. AIM: Through cross‐sectional design we investigated the impact of child’s dental pain, caregiver’s fear of SARS‐CoV2 and parental distress on oral health related quality of life (OHRQOL) of preschoolers during the nationwide COVID‐19 pandemic lockdown. DESIGN: Preschool children self‐reported their pain using pieces of hurt scale; caregiver SARS‐CoV2 fear was assessed using fear of COVID‐19 scale and parental distress evaluated using 4‐item scale. Child’s oral health assessed using dmft index and OHRQOL evaluated using early childhood oral health impact scale. Bivariate, multivariate regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors; statistical significance was set at 5%. RESULTS: Sample mean age was 4.58 years, and about 69% were boys. Children reporting higher pain scores (OR=1.9) due to decayed teeth and having dmft >5 (OR=4.25); followed by greater parental distress (OR=4.13) and fear of SARS‐CoV2 (OR=3.84) were significantly associated with poor OHRQOL during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

2023;Visual Field Artifacts from Face Mask Use.;10.1097/ijg.0000000000001605;PURPOSE The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound impact on how glaucoma care is delivered, necessitating reduced clinic flow, social distancing, and use of face coverings by patients and staff. This case highlights the need to be aware of improperly fitted face masks as a cause of artifact on standard automated perimetry (SAP). CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 32-year-old female underwent SAP with the 24-2 SITA Fast test of the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) wearing an ear-loop surgical face mask. At the end of testing it was noted that the mask had ridden up the patient's face. Small amounts of condensate were noted on the perimeter lens. CLINICAL FINDINGS SAP demonstrated good reliability indices but in both eyes there was a marked reduction in sensitivity inferiorly. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test was outside normal limits. It was ensured the upper border of mask was well sealed with the loops secured around the ears and nasal strip of the mask pinched down. Visual fields were repeated and were found to be normal. CONCLUSIONS Poorly fitting face masks represent a new cause of visual field artifact which may mimic pathological field defects. Without careful attention during testing, the cause of such artifacts may not be apparent, especially as reliability indices may be normal. Adjustments to the fit of face masks may help prevent fogging or mask slippage and increase test reliability.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32675556/";14/7/2020;coronavirus;0.9789
2024;Social support and acute stress symptoms (ASSs) during the COVID-19 outbreak: deciphering the roles of psychological needs and sense of control;10.1080/20008198.2020.1779494;Background: A cute stress symptoms (ASSs) are likely to be a common mental health problem in the acute period following the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak. To address this risk, substantial social support has been provided to relieve ASSs during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the effectiveness of these support methods for relieving ASSs has not yet been assessed. Objective: The current study sought to examine the underlying mechanisms by which social support relieves ASSs, among primary and secondary school teachers. Method: A sample of 751 primary and secondary school teachers was selected to answer self-reported questionnaires regarding ASSs, social support, psychological needs, and the sense of control. Results: Structural equation modelling revealed that social support had a non-significant direct relationship with ASSs, and a significant indirect relationship with reduced ASSs via the needs for autonomy and relatedness, and via the paths from three types of psychological needs to the sense of control. Conclusion: These findings suggest that social support can play a relieving role in ASSs when the support satisfies individuals’ psychological needs and improves their sense of control. To alleviate ASSs among primary and secondary school teachers, more attention should be paid to satisfying their specific psychological needs and improving their sense of control.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2020.1779494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33062202/";8/9/2020;coronavirus pneumonia;0.979
2025;An evaluation of mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19;10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa016;Mathematical modelling performs a vital part in estimating and controlling the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this epidemic, most countries impose severe intervention measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The policymakers are forced to make difficult decisions to leverage between health and economic development. How and when to make clinical and public health decisions in an epidemic situation is a challenging question. The most appropriate solution is based on scientific evidence, which is mainly dependent on data and models. So one of the most critical problems during this crisis is whether we can develop reliable epidemiological models to forecast the evolution of the virus and estimate the effectiveness of various intervention measures and their impacts on the economy. There are numerous types of mathematical model for epidemiological diseases. In this paper, we present some critical reviews on mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19. Some elementary models are presented as an initial formulation for an epidemic. We give some basic concepts, notations, and foundation for epidemiological modelling. More related works are also introduced and evaluated by considering epidemiological features such as disease tendency, latent effects, susceptibility, basic reproduction numbers, asymptomatic infections, herd immunity, and impact of the interventions.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7376265/;22/5/2020;Mathematical modelling;0.9393
2026;RT qLAMP--Direct Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Raw Sewage;10.1101/2020.10.01.20205492;The project purpose was to examine ability of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to quantify SARS-CoV-2 in raw sewage, directly, using no preliminary sample processing for virus concentration and RNA extraction. An objective was to take advantage of extensive recently published work to facilitate process development, principally primer selection, and to use readily available off the shelf materials with conventional lab procedure and equipment. Well-developed and referenced primers for ORF1a, E, and N-gene targets were selected and applied, using commercially available synthetic RNA standards, and raw sewage from a local wastewater agency serving 650,000. County health department monitoring provided current COVID-19 data. Testing defined performance characteristics for each primer set, with significant differences between them. Specific amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed using each of the primer sets, with E-gene and N-gene primers most effective. Positive analysis results from all raw sewage samples corresponded to calculated concentrations of virus in 5-10 L raw sewage aliquots for 25 L reactions. Results show that even at low reported case rates e.g. 1-10/100,000, SARS-CoV-2 is present in raw sewage at > 1-5/ L, permitting direct LAMP-based detection. Use of RT qLAMP will facilitate wastewater-based epidemiology as an important component for COVID-19 control.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.01.20205492; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205492v1?rss=1";4/10/2020;County health department monitoring;0.9561
2027;Unusual echocardiographic evidence of hypercoagulation in usual left atrium appendage as the first and only sign of COVID-19.;10.5603/fm.a2021.0059;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a condition caused by a novel virus, SARS-CoV-2. The disease's course ranges from entirely asymptomatic to severely ill patients. Hypercoagulation is often a complication of this disease, worsening the prognosis, which is extremely important in patients at higher risk of thromboembolic events, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), where thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage (LAA) is frequent. LAA could be of various sizes, volumes, and shapes, distinguish several morphologies, from which the WindSock LAA is the most frequent. In contrast, thromboembolic complications occur most frequently in patients with AF and the Cactus LAA. We present a clinical case of a 70-year-old woman with an initial negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, suspicion of device-related infection after dual pacemaker implantation, AF, and LAA without thrombus in the initial transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Despite apixaban treatment, spontaneous restoration of sinus rhythm, and WindSock LAA morphology, the sludge in LAA was diagnosed in control TEE. The patient did not present any typical clinical COVID-19 symptoms but re-checked the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection was positive. The described case presents echocardiographic evidence of hypercoagulation as the first and only feature of SARS-CoV-2 condition besides the usual morphological presentation of the WindSock LAA.;"https://doi.org/10.5603/fm.a2021.0059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34060640/";1/6/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9693
2028;COVID-19 Surveillance and Competition in Sport: Utilizing Sport Science to Protect Athletes and Staff during and after the Pandemic;10.3390/jfmk5030069;The ongoing Coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic abruptly halted athletic competition and standard training practices, consequently generating great confusion surrounding when and how to safely reintroduce sports. Therefore, tangible solutions disseminated to performance staff, coaches, and athletes are warranted to ensure optimal levels of health and physical performance for all personnel during both the current social distancing standards as well as the impending return of competition despite continued risks. In this commentary, we offer strategies for utilizing technology and data tools as components of longitudinal COVID-19 surveillance based on ongoing research efforts as well as current guidance from governing bodies, while also serving the performance needs of the athletes and staff. Recommended data sources include digital symptom and well-being surveys, standardized and routine physical performance testing, sleep and sleep physiology monitoring, cognitive applications, and temperature. This system is flexible to numerous commercially available products and is designed for easy implementation that permits instant feedback provided directly to the athlete as well as their support staff for early intervention, ultimately mitigating COVID-19 risks.

2029;The Diagnosis of SARS‐CoV2 Pneumonia: A Review of Laboratory and Radiological Testing Results;10.1002/jmv.26081;The rapid emergence of COVID‐19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has necessitated the implementation of diverse pandemic control strategies throughout the world. In order to effectively control the spread of this disease, it is essential that it be diagnosed at an early stage so that patients can be reliably quarantined such that disease spread will be slowed. At present, the diagnosis of this infectious form of coronavirus pneumonia is largely dependent upon a combination of laboratory testing and imaging analyses of variable diagnostic efficacy. In the present report, we reviewed prior literature pertaining to the diagnosis of different forms of pneumonia caused by coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS‐CoV‐2) and assessed two different potential diagnostic approaches. We ultimately found that computed tomography (CT) was associated with a higher rate of diagnostic accuracy than was a real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)‐based approach (P = 0.0041), and chest radiography (P = 0.0100). Even so, it is important that clinicians utilize a combination of laboratory and radiological testing where possible in order to ensure that this virus is reliably and quickly detected such that it may be treated and patients may be isolated in a timely fashion, thereby effectively curbing the further progression of this pandemic.

2030;729 Effect Of COVID-19 On Orthopaedic Trauma Admissions in A London District General Hospital;10.1093/bjs/znab134.080;INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has presented orthopaedic services with new challenges across all aspects of healthcare delivery. This study explores the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on trauma admissions at a London District General Hospital. METHOD: Data was collected retrospectively from electronic patient records during the lockdown period (16(th) March -30(th)April 2020) and compared to the same dates in 2019. Patient age, date and time of admission, operation and anaesthesia timings and length of stay (LOS) were analysed. RESULTS: Fewer trauma patients were admitted in 2020 (108 vs. 65). Additionally, there was a patient demographics shift, with mean age increasing from 55.6 years to 64.1 years (p = 0.038). Falls remained the leading cause of injury, although the proportion dropped from 75% to 62%. Anaesthesia duration was longer in 2020 (136 vs 83 minutes, p < 0.00001). Similarly, there was a 13.6% increase in median operation length. Finally, although LOS was similar, admission-operation was greatly reduced in 2020 (1.22 days vs 4.74, p < 0.0000001). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic trauma care remains a vital service, particularly in high-volume hospitals. By understanding the effects of the lockdown on trauma admissions, healthcare managers can more effectively plan for future changes in non-emergent trauma service delivery as we move towards easing lockdown restrictions.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135889/;4/5/2021;coronavirus pandemic;0.9057
2031;Rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 using potential point-of-care electrochemical immunosensor: Toward the future prospects.;10.1080/08830185.2021.1872566;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an emerging and highly infectious disease making global public health concern and socio-economic burden. It is caused due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). It has the tendency to spread rapidly through person-to-person. Currently, several molecular diagnostic platforms such as PCR, qRT-PCR, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), CRISPR are utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. These conventional techniques are costly, time consuming and require sophisticated instrumentation facility with well trained personnel for testing. Hence, it is tough to provide testing en-masse to the people in developing countries. On the other hand, several serological biosensors such as lateral flow immunosensor, optical, electrochemical, microfluidics integrated electrochemical/fluorescence is currently utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. In current pandemic situation, there is an urgent need of rapid and efficient diagnosis on mass scale of SARS-CoV-2 for early stage detection. Early monitoring of viral infections can help to control and prevent the spreading of infections in large chunk of population. In this review, the SARS-CoV-2 and their biomarkers in biological samples, collection of samples and recently reported potential electrochemical immunosensors for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/08830185.2021.1872566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448909/";15/1/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9801
2032;Online psychological counselling during lockdown reduces anxiety symptoms and negative affect: Insights from Italian framework.;10.1002/cpp.2608;"Several studies have shown how COrona-VIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19) and the consequent isolation and quarantine measures could affect physical and mental well-being. Therefore, the increased request for support and assistance represents a critical challenge for clinicians requiring a reorganization of care systems. In this regard, online counselling has been identified as a useful tool in providing psychological assistance and support. Thus, the main purpose of the current study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of a single online counselling session in reducing psychopathological symptoms (i.e., state anxiety and negative affect) and increasing individual well-being and positive affect during the first Italian lockdown. Fifty-three subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive an online counselling session (Online Counselling Group; OCG= 26) or to act as controls (Waiting List Group; WLG= 27). In the post-assessment, compared to WLG, the OCG showed a significant decrease in negative affect (18.04±6.30 vs 30.26±8.61; F1:47 = 29.448; p< .001; dppc2 = .92) and state anxiety (36.65±8.35 vs 48.04±11.51; F1:47 = 17.857; p< .001; dppc2 = .49).

Previous studies have shown that females report higher depression and anxiety than males. The present study aims to test the differences in depression and anxiety between males and females who have experienced COVID-19. This a descriptive, observational, comparative study, among Saudi Arabian population. A total of 686 participants have been recruited. Participants completed an online questionnaire that contains questions about sociodemographic, COVID-19, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to measure anxiety and depression, respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of the participants were excluded and our final sample consisted of 507 participants (median age 23; 65% females). Of the final sample, 23% (118) have been previously diagnosed with COVID-19. There is no significant difference in GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores between COVID-19- positive and COVID-19-negative populations. However, females who have experienced COVID-19 reported significantly higher GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores compared to males. CONCLUSION: The results of our study show that females are significantly at a higher risk for depression and anxiety as a result of COVID-19 infection compared to males. Further epidemiological studies are required for a better understanding of this correlation.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8165132/;31/5/2021;Psychological disorders;0.9392

The present study challenged COVID-19 Ab RDTs with pre-pandemic samples of patients exposed to tropical pathogens. A retrospective study was performed on archived serum (n = 94) and EDTA whole blood (n = 126) samples obtained during 2010-2018 from 196 travelers with malaria (n = 170), schistosomiasis (n = 25) and dengue (n = 25). COVID-19 Ab RDTs were selected based on regulatory approval status, independent evaluation results and detecting antigens.

2035;In Silico Identification of Small Molecules as New Cdc25 Inhibitors through the Correlation between Chemosensitivity and Protein Expression Pattern;10.3390/ijms22073714;The cell division cycle 25 (Cdc25) protein family plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation, making it an excellent target for cancer therapy. In this work, a set of small molecules were identified as Cdc25 modulators by applying a mixed ligand-structure-based approach and taking advantage of the correlation between the chemosensitivity of selected structures and the protein expression pattern of the proposed target. In the first step of the in silico protocol, a set of molecules acting as Cdc25 inhibitors were identified through a new ligand-based protocol and the evaluation of a large database of molecular structures. Subsequently, induced-fit docking (IFD) studies allowed us to further reduce the number of compounds biologically screened. In vitro antiproliferative and enzymatic inhibition assays on the selected compounds led to the identification of new structurally heterogeneous inhibitors of Cdc25 proteins. Among them, J3955, the most active inhibitor, showed concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells, with GI(50) in the low micromolar range. When J3955 was tested in cell-cycle perturbation experiments, it caused mitotic failure by G2/M-phase cell-cycle arrest. Finally, Western blotting analysis showed an increment of phosphorylated Cdk1 levels in cells exposed to J3955, indicating its specific influence in cellular pathways involving Cdc25 proteins.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8038176/;2/4/2021;induced-fit docking;0.9932

In doing so, opportunities for physical activity were likely reduced, potentially causing detrimental effects to older adults. Therefore, the present study investigated the influence of the initial six weeks of lockdown on physical activity levels, perceived physical function and mood in older adults. A cross-sectional, mixed-methods, observational study was conducted using self-administered, fortnightly online surveys throughout the UK between 21st March-4 May 2020.

Despite lockdown restrictions, this group of older adults maintained their pre-lockdown physical activity levels, but also increased their self-reported sedentary time. Subsequently, perception of physical function was maintained across lockdown. With regards to mood; the only strong evidence for an increase in depression was for males (ps = 95.35%; >0.3 AU), although self-reported levels of depression were similar between sexes at week six.

This disease spread to 215 countries affecting a wide range of people. World health organization (WHO) called it a pandemic and it was officially named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2 (SARS CoV-2), also known as Corona virus disease (COVID-19). These pandemic compelled countries to enforce a socio-economic lockdown to prevent its widespread. This paper focuses on how the particulate matter pollution was reduced during the lockdown period (23 March to 15 April 2020) as compared to before lockdown. Both ground-based and satellite observations were used to identify the improvement in air quality of Pakistan with primary focus on four major cities of Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar. Both datasets have shown a substantial reduction in PM(2.5) pollution levels (ranging from 13 to 33% in case of satellite observations, while 23 to 58 % in ground-based observations) across Pakistan. Result shows a higher rate of COVID-19 spread in major cities of Pakistan in cities of Pakistan with poor air quality conditions. Yet more research is needed in order to establish linkage between COVID-19 spread and air pollution. However, it can be partially attributed to both higher rate of population density and frequent exposure of population to enhanced levels of PM(2.5) concentrations before lockdown period.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110421; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120313189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33160973/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120313189?v=s5";6/11/2020;Corona virus disease;0.9488
2038;Universal trends in human cough airflows at large distances.;10.1063/5.0021666;Coughs are one of the primary means of transmission of diseases such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Disease spreading occurs by the expulsion of pathogen containing aerosol droplets. Fine droplets can pass through layers of masks and are carried away by the exhaled airflow unlike larger droplets that settle down due to gravity. Hence, it is important to quantitatively assess the maximum distance of travel of typical human coughs with and without different types of masks. Even though near field data are available near the mouth, far field data are scarce. In this study, the schlieren method that is a highly sensitive, non-intrusive flow visualization technique is used. It can directly image weak density gradients produced by coughs. An assessment of different methods of covering the mouth while coughing is arrived at by using observations from high speed schlieren images. The effectiveness of coughing into the elbow is examined. The velocity of propagation of coughs and the distance of propagation with and without masks are quantified. It is also found that normalizing the distance-velocity profiles causes all the data to collapse onto a universal non-dimensional curve irrespective of the usage of different types of masks or test subjects. Visualization of cough flow fields and analysis of experimental data reveal that the flow physics is governed by the propagation of viscous vortex rings.;"https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0021666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904942/";1/8/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9809
2039;Pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced ARDS: implications for an aging population;10.1183/13993003.02049-2020;The coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic has elicited a swift response by the scientific community to elucidate the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2-induced lung injury and develop effective therapeutics. Clinical data indicate that severe COVID-19 most commonly manifests as viral pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a clinical entity mechanistically understood best in the context of influenza A virus-induced pneumonia. Similar to influenza, advanced age has emerged as the leading host risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. In this review we connect the current understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and host response to the clinical presentation of COVID-19, borrowing concepts from influenza A virus-induced ARDS pathogenesis and discussing how these ideas inform our evolving understanding of COVID-19-induced ARDS. We also consider important differences between COVID-19 and influenza, mainly COVID-19's protean clinical presentation and associated lymphopenia, the contrasting role of interferon-γ in mediating the host immune response to these viruses, and SARS-CoV-2's tropism for vascular endothelial cells, commenting on the potential limitations of influenza as a model for COVID-19. Finally, we explore hallmarks of aging that could explain the association between advanced age and susceptibility to severe COVID-19.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747391/; https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.02049-2020";3/8/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9803
2040;Severe Urosepsis Secondary to Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis: A Case Report;10.7759/cureus.15190;Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is considered to be a rare variant of chronic pyelonephritis, which results in non-functioning kidneys in patients. The exact etiology of this disease is still unknown, and hence even its pathophysiology remains unclear. We present a case of a 27-year-old Saudi male patient who had been bed-bound with a known case of a congenital anomaly with severe kyphoscoliosis, bilateral lower limbs deformity with paraplegia, and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt since childhood. The patient was brought to the emergency department (ED) with right flank pain associated with fever and difficulty in breathing. The patient had a past medical history of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) with up to two incidences per year and renal stones. He had been recently discharged from the ICU of another hospital with sepsis due to UTI. An abdominal CT scan was performed, which showed a mass in the upper lobe of the right kidney measuring about 9 x 8 x 6 cm, suggestive of XGP. The final diagnosis was severe urosepsis secondary to right obstructive pyelonephritis. Patients with XGP usually present with nonspecific symptoms including back and abdominal pain, fever, UTI, and the condition is more common among middle-aged women. Ultimately, early detection and diagnosis, followed by prompt treatment with partial or total nephrectomy are associated witha good prognosis for patients with XGP.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046288/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15190";23/5/2021;emergency department;0.9384
2041;Impacts of carbon-based nanomaterials on nutrient removal in constructed wetlands: Microbial community structure, enzyme activities, and metabolism process.;10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123270;The increasing use of raw carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) will inevitably affect wastewater treatment systems. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are ecological wastewater treatment facilities and can intercept the vast particles pollutant, including CBNs. However, the impacts of CBNs on the treatment performance of CWs have no available knowledge. Therefore, we systematically inspected the effects of single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs and MWCNTs) and fullerene nanoparticles (C60) on CW performance under 180-day exposure to 0, 10 and 1000 μg/L concentrations. The results showed that CBNs had marginally adverse impacts on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP) removal, whereas nitrogen removal declined by 24.1 %-42.7 % following long-term exposure to CBNs. MWCNTs had the greatest inhibition effect on nitrogen removal, followed by SWCNTs and C60. The CBNs also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction as the increasing concentration, which confirmed that CBNs have biotoxic effects in CWs. The variation of functional microbial community and the inhibition of enzyme activities were the dominant reasons for the decline in nitrogen removal efficiency. Furthermore, predictive functional profiling showed that CBNs affected functional gene abundance, and caused a decline in the enzymes abundance connected to nitrogen removal by the end of the 180-day exposure period.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645543/";22/6/2020;chemical oxygen demand;0.9909
2042;COVID-19 and hepatitis B infection.;10.3851/imp3382;The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a major burden worldwide, resulting in serious public health challenges. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is another widely spread virus that chronically affects about 257 million people. The management of patients with HBV infection has gained attention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 have varying levels of liver involvements, resulting from direct viral effects on the liver as well as hepatotoxic drugs. This was demonstrated by elevated levels of liver enzymes, particularly evident in those patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, scarce information is available on the management of COVID-19 patients having an underlying chronic liver disease, including HBV infection. Studies have shown reactivation of HBV infection following treatment with tocilizumab and corticosteroids, emphasizing the need for caution when using these agents to treat COVID-19 patients with HBV infection. HBV screening and prophylaxis should be considered in patients with elevated transaminases levels and also in high prevalence populations. In patients with advanced liver disease, attention must be given to minimize the risk of liver decompensation. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to enable an evidence-based approach to the care of these patients.;"https://doi.org/10.3851/imp3382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616549/";22/2/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9362
2043;Fertility intentions among couples in Shanghai under COVID-19: A cross-sectional study.;10.1002/ijgo.13366;OBJECTIVE To evaluate fertility intensions among couples in Shanghai under the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) pandemic against the backdrop of persistently low fertility. METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out using data from studies conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected regarding sociodemographic characteristics, history of reproduction and gynecology, fertility intention before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, female psychological state, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life. RESULTS Under the influence of COVID-19, 296/447 (66.2%) participants did not change their original fertility intention to have children, while 151/447 (33.8%) of participants were affected by the outbreak. Participants who believed in government and hospital control policies were less likely to change their intention to become pregnant (P<10-3 , P<10-3 ). In contrast, concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on female and fetal health led participants to cancel their original pregnancy plans (P<10-3 ). CONCLUSION Three in ten couples of childbearing age, who originally expressed their intention of becoming pregnant, canceled their pregnancy plans after the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 outbreak has brought new challenges to people's physical and mental health. Effective policies and measures can help to improve people's fertility intentions with respect to having children.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32880942/";2/9/2020;coronavirus infection;0.9424
2044;Low-field thoracic magnetic stimulation increases peripheral oxygen saturation levels in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients: a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study;10.1101/2021.05.21.21256456;The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may cause low oxygen saturation (SpO2) and respiratory failure in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. Hence the increase of SpO2 levels could be crucial for the quality of life and recovery of these patients. Here we introduce an electromagnetic device termed low-field thoracic magnetic stimulation (LF-ThMS) system. This device was designed to non-invasively deliver a pulsed magnetic field from 100 to 118 Hz and 10.5 to 13.1 mT (i.e., 105 to 131 Gauss) to the dorsal thorax. We show that these frequencies and magnetic flux densities are safe for the patients. We also present a proof-of-concept that a single session of LF-ThMS applied for 30 minutes to the dorsal thorax of 17 COVID-19 patients significantly increases their SpO2 levels. We designed a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study on 5 COVID-19 patients who underwent two sessions of the study (real and sham LF-ThMS) and 12 COVID-19 patients who underwent only the real LF-ThMS. We found a statistically significant correlation between magnetic flux density, frequency, or temperature associated with the real LF-ThMS and SpO2 levels in all COVID-19 patients. However, the five patients of the sham-controlled study did not exhibit a significant change in their SpO2 levels during sham stimulation. All the patients did not present adverse events after the LF-ThMS intervention.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.21.21256456; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.21.21256456v1?rss=1";25/5/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9856
2045;A Machine Learning Explanation of Incidence Inequalities of SARS-CoV-2 Across 88 Days in 157 Countries;10.1101/2020.06.06.20124529;Because the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic viral outbreaks will likely continue until effective vaccines are widely administered, (1) new capabilities to accurately predict incidence rates by location and time to know in advance the disease burden and specific needs for any given population are valuable to minimize morbidity and mortality. In this study, a random forest of 9,250 regression trees was applied to 6,941 observations of 13 statistically significant predictor variables targeting SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates per 100,000 across 88 days in 157 countries. One key finding is an algorithm that can predict the incidence rate per day of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic cycle with a pseudo-R2 accuracy of 98.5% and explain 97.4% of the variances. Another key finding is the relative importance of 13 demographic, economic, environmental, and public health modulators to the SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate. Four factors proposed in earlier research as potential modulators have no statistically significant relationship with incidence rates (2)(3). These findings give leaders new capabilities for improved capacity planning and targeting stay-at-home interventions and prioritizing programming by knowing the atypical social determinants that are the root causes of SARS-CoV-2 incidence variance. This work also proves that machine learning can accurately and quickly explain disease dynamics for zoonoses with pandemic potential.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.06.20124529; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.06.20124529v1?rss=1";8/6/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9187
2046;Variations of Serum Oxidative Stress Biomarkers under First-Line Antituberculosis Treatment: A Pilot Study;10.3390/jpm11020112;"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the highest infectious burdens worldwide, and pathogenesis is yet incompletely elucidated. Bacilli dissemination is due to poor antioxidant defense mechanisms and intensified oxidative stress. There are few recent studies that analyzed and compared free radicals or antioxidant status before and after anti-TB treatment. Hence, the present study underlines the need to identify oxidative stress as it could be a useful tool in TB monitorisation. Thirty newly diagnosed patients with pulmonary TB were included after signing an informed consent. Blood was collected before receiving first-line anti-tubercular therapy (T0) and after 60 days (T2). Spectrophotometric methods were used to quantify oxidative parameters (TBARS—thiobarbituric acid reactive species); enzymatic antioxidants such as SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), GPx (glutathione peroxidase), and TAC (total antioxidant capacity); and non-enzymatic antioxidants such as GSH (reduced glutathione). A moderate positive correlation was found between GSH and TAC (r = 0.63, p-value = 0.046) and GSH and SOD (r = 0.64, p-value = 0.041) at T2. Increased values of GSH, CAT, and SOD were noted at T2 in comparison with T0, while GPx, TAC, and TBARS decreased at T2. A better monitorisation in TB could be based on oxidative stress and antioxidant status.

2047;COVID-19-Related Coagulopathy—Is Transferrin a Missing Link?;10.3390/diagnostics10080539;SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 disease has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, but the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related coagulopathy remain unknown. The risk of severe COVID-19 disease is higher in males than in females and increases with age. To identify gene products that may contribute to COVID-19-related coagulopathy, we analyzed the expression of genes associated with the Gene Ontology (GO) term “blood coagulation” in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database and identified four procoagulants, whose expression is higher in males and increases with age (ADAMTS13, F11, HGFAC, KLKB1), and two anticoagulants, whose expression is higher in females and decreases with age (C1QTNF1, SERPINA5). However, the expression of none of these genes was regulated in a proteomics dataset of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and none of the proteins have been identified as a binding partner of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Hence, they may rather generally predispose individuals to thrombosis without directly contributing to COVID-19-related coagulopathy. In contrast, the expression of the procoagulant transferrin (not associated to the GO term “blood coagulation”) was higher in males, increased with age, and was upregulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, transferrin warrants further examination in ongoing clinic-pathological investigations.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32751741/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10080539";30/7/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9178
2048;Subtypes of Depression: Latent Class Analysis in Spanish Old People with Depressive Symptoms;10.3390/life10050070;Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most disabling disorders and the one that most contributes to disability. When it occurs in older people, it is an additional burden to their potential physical and cognitive deficiencies, making MDD an important public health problem that supposes a large investment in health. There is a clear lack of consistency between the subtypes of depression found in the literature, ranging from two to seven classes, with three being the most commonly found non-melancholic, melancholic and psychotic, or putative psychotics. The aim of this research is to add knowledge to the profiles of depressive symptoms in a representative sample of older Spanish people, and to study the possible relationship of these symptom profiles with variables that have traditionally been related to depression. Spanish data from the sixth wave of SHARE were used, with 612 Spanish older adults living in Spain. A routine of several LCAs with a different number of classes was performed to answer this first aim to classify Spanish adults with depression symptoms. The results pointed out the presence of three different classes among the participants in the study: psychosomatic (11.12%), melancholic (14.21%), and anhedonic (74.67%). This work represents a step forward to understand the heterogeneity of major depressive disorder, facilitating the diagnosis, and subsequent treatment of older adults.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32443474/; https://doi.org/10.3390/life10050070";18/5/2020;Major depressive disorder;0.9763
2049;Challenges, opportunities and progress in solid waste management during COVID-19 pandemic;10.1016/j.cscee.2020.100060;At the end of December 2019, Wuhan City became the epicenter of the highly contagious virus known as the novel coronavirus. Now that mid-2020 has already passed, almost every country is adversely affected by Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). The routine activities of people of all ages are overturned, which has led to a shift in the trends of waste created by households, streets, and most importantly, medical facilities and quarantine centers. Compulsive use of personal protection equipment such as masks, gloves, sanitizers, etcetera by the frontline workers from the medical sector, banks, daily need stores, waste collection industries, etc. and the use of masks by every common man stepping out has skewed the trend of waste generation to a different direction. Recently, the replacement of single-use plastic was accepted by the masses, and the pandemic suddenly rebounded to the previous situation, it is expected to be worse in the long run. Another secondary outcome is reduced waste collection and recycling due to lockdown, leading to a pile-up of wastes. But several nations are adopting strategies to break the transmission chain of the virus by trying to minimize human contact. The study discusses the effect of COVID-19 on the generation, recycling, and disposal of solid waste. A brief collection of different countries' efforts to restrict the transmission of virus through solid waste is also discussed.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266601642030058X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S266601642030058X";25/11/2020;Corona Virus Disease;0.9865
2050;Natural Photosensitizers in Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy;10.3390/biomedicines9060584;"Health problems and reduced treatment effectiveness due to antimicrobial resistance have become important global problems and are important factors that negatively affect life expectancy. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) is constantly evolving and can minimize this antimicrobial resistance problem. Reactive oxygen species produced when nontoxic photosensitizers are exposed to light are the main functional components of APDT responsible for microbial destruction; therefore, APDT has a broad spectrum of target pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Various photosensitizers, including natural extracts, compounds, and their synthetic derivatives, are being investigated. The main limitations, such as weak antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, solubility, specificity, and cost, encourage the exploration of new photosensitizer candidates. Many additional methods, such as cell surface engineering, cotreatment with membrane-damaging agents, nanotechnology, computational simulation, and sonodynamic therapy, are also being investigated to develop novel APDT methods with improved properties. In this review, we summarize APDT research, focusing on natural photosensitizers used in in vitro and in vivo experimental models. In addition, we describe the limitations observed for natural photosensitizers and the methods developed to counter those limitations with emerging technologies.";"https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9060584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063973/";21/5/2021;Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy;0.9511
2051;Priorities, actions and risks in the COVID-19 pandemic: a flash SoMe survey among surgical oncologists;10.1515/pp-2020-0142;OBJECTIVES: Corona virus-induced disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has globally affected the surgical treatment of cancer patients and has challenged the ethical principles of surgical oncologists around the world. Not only treatment but also diagnosis and follow-up have been disrupted. METHODS: An online survey was sent through Twitter and by the surgical societies worldwide. The survey consisted of 29 closed-ended questions and was conducted over a period of 24 days beginning in March 26, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 394 surgical oncologists from 41 different countries answered the questionnaire. The predominant guiding principle was “saving lives” 240 (62%), and the different aspects of lock-down found hence large support (mean 7.1–9.3 out of 10). Shut-down of elective surgery and modification of cancer care found a mean support of 7.0 ± 3.0 and 5.8 ± 3.1, respectively. Modification of cancer care longer than two weeks was considered unacceptable to 114 (29%) responders. Hundred and fifty six (40%) and 138 (36%) expect “return to normal” beyond six months for surgical practice and cancer care, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical oncologists show strong and long-lasting support for lock-down measures aiming to save lives. The impact of the pandemic on surgical oncology is perceived controversially, but the majority was forced already now to accept what is inacceptable for many of their colleagues.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8223800/;25/1/2021;Corona virus-induced disease 19;0.918

OBJECTIVE To analyze the existing scientific literature on strategies and recommendations to respond to VAW during the implementation of social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. SEARCH STRATEGY An integrative review was conducted based on articles published between December 2019 and June 2020. Suitable articles were identified from the PubMed, SciELO, and LILACS databases, using relevant terms. SELECTION CRITERIA Eligible studies included opinion and primary research articles describing the dynamics of VAW during quarantine and in the context of the restrictive measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic and proposing recommendations to respond to this issue. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data were extracted from eligible publications and qualitative synthesis was used. MAIN RESULTS The 38 articles included in the study showed that some factors increasing women's vulnerabilities to violence were exacerbated during the social distancing and lockdown period. Health professionals are essential for screening and responding to VAW during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Strategies must include integrated actions aiming to prevent and respond to violence during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. These must be designed based on lessons learned from previous public health emergencies.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32880941/";3/9/2020;BACKGROUND;0.9088
2053;Revisiting potential druggable targets against SARS‐CoV‐2 and repurposing therapeutics under preclinical study and clinical trials: A comprehensive review;10.1002/ddr.21709;Coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), is one of the most contagious diseases in human history that has already affected millions of lives worldwide. To date, no vaccines or effective therapeutics have been discovered yet that may successfully treat COVID‐19 patients or contain the transmission of the virus. Scientific communities across the globe responded rapidly and have been working relentlessly to develop drugs and vaccines, which may require considerable time. In this uncertainty, repurposing the existing antiviral drugs could be the best strategy to speed up the discovery of effective therapeutics against SARS‐CoV‐2. Moreover, drug repurposing may leave some vital information on druggable targets that could be capitalized in target‐based drug discovery. Information on possible drug targets and the progress on therapeutic and vaccine development also needs to be updated. In this review, we revisited the druggable targets that may hold promise in the development of the anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 agent. Progresses on the development of potential therapeutics and vaccines that are under the preclinical studies and clinical trials have been highlighted.

In this research, we report sensing of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus in seconds via an electrochemical platform consisting of gold micropillar array electrodes decorated with reduced graphene oxide and functionalized with recombinant viral antigens. The array electrodes are fabricated by Aerosol Jet (AJ) nanoparticle 3D printing, where gold nanoparticles (3-5nm) are assembled in 3D space, sintered, and integrated with a microfluidic device. The device is shown to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein and its receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at concentrations down to 1pM via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and read by a smartphone-based user interface. In addition, the sensor can be regenerated within a minute by introducing a low-pH chemistry that elutes the antibodies from the antigens, allowing successive testing of multiple antibody samples using the same sensor. The detection time for the two antibodies tested in this work is 11.5 seconds. S1 protein sensing of its antibodies is specific, which cross-reacts neither with other antibodies nor with proteins such as Nucleocapsid antibody and Interleukin-6 protein. The proposed sensing platform is generic and can also be used for the rapid detection of biomarkers for other infectious agents such as Ebola, HIV, and Zika, which will benefit the public health.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.13.20193722; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193722v1?rss=1";14/9/2020;receptor-binding-domain;0.9924

Materials and Methods: The measurements were conducted during rest and after performing SMWT (Six Minute Walk Test) and SCT (Stair Climb Test) in 26 patients after ischemic stroke (IS) and 26 healthy individuals. Results: In the SMWT, the post-stroke group (SG) walked a shorter distance (p < 0.001), achieving lower mean gait velocity (p < 0.001) and lower maximum gait velocity (p = 0.002). In the SCT, SG achieved a lower mean gait velocity (p < 0.001) and lower maximum gait velocity (p < 0.001) when compared to the control group (CG). In SG, myocardial ischemia in ECG was noted in four patients after SMWT and in three patients following SCT. Both in SG and in CG the increase in SBP (systolic blood pressure) value measured after SMWT and SCT compared to at rest (p < 0.001) was observed. In SG, in the compared ratios rest to SMWT and SCT as well as SMWT to SCT, there was an increase in HR (heart rate) (p < 0.001). Conclusions: ECG M-Trace Base II and Samsung Health are mobile applications that can assess cardiological parameters and exercise tolerance parameters in patients after IS, so they can be used to plan the intensity of exercise in rehabilitation programs.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8199294/;27/5/2021;systolic blood pressure;0.9649

Keywords included coronavirus, epidemic, quarantine, stress, mental health, and similar terms. Included studies enrolled participants under quarantine, quantitatively measured mental health or well-being, and characterized outcomes by age.Results: Of 894 initial results, 20 studies met the criteria and were included. Studies comprise 106,553 participants from eight countries, ages 6-100, two epidemics (COVID-19, SARS), and 27 assessment tools. One study found greater distress in older adults relative to younger adults, one found no significant differences, and 18 found lower negative outcomes in older participants in at least one metric.Conclusions: Older adults in this review generally have lower stress and less negative emotions under quarantine than younger adults. It is unknown how this compares to pre-pandemic measures. More representative and longitudinal studies are needed to measure the impact of quarantine on the mental health of older adults.Clinical Implications: As existing scales may not capture the full extent of pandemic psychological effects on older adults, clinicians must vigilantly monitor older adults' mental health.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2021.1928355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080527/";3/6/2021;two epidemics;0.92
2058;Experience of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Patient Care in the Amsterdam Region: Optimization of Acute Care Organization;10.1017/dmp.2020.446;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic causes a large number of patients to simultaneously be in need of specialized care. In the Netherlands, hospitals scaled up their intensive care unit and clinical admission capacity at an early stage of the pandemic. The importance of coordinating resources during a pandemic has already been emphasized in the literature. Therefore, in order to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 admissions, national and regional task forces were established for the purpose of coordinating patient transfers. This review describes the experience of Regionaal Overleg Acute Zorg (ROAZ) region Noord-Holland Flevoland, in coordinating patient transfers in the Amsterdam region. In total, 130 patient transfers were coordinated by our region, of which 73% patients were transferred to a hospital within the region. Over a 2-month period, similarities regarding days with increased patient transfers were seen between our region and the national task force. In parallel, an increased incidence in hospital admissions in the Netherlands was observed. During a pandemic, an early upscale (an increase in surge spaces) of hospital admission capacity is imperative. Furthermore, it is preferred to establish national and regional task forces, coordinated by physicians experienced and trained in handling crisis situations, adhering full transparency regarding hospital admission capacity.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33208200/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.446";19/11/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9752
2059;Clinical and Pathogenic Correlations Between SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome in Children.;10.26574/maedica.2020.15.3.376;Background The present paper examines the correlations between coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) from a clinical and pathophysiological point of view. Method: We describe COVID-19 and HUS by outlining the similarities and differences, detailing each one's pathway into the body, explaining the consequences of the inflammatory response, mainly on multiple organ dysfunction, the foremost complication that can lead to death in both cases. Using reviews from specialized literature and guidelines, we had an approach based on critical interpretive synthesis. Nonetheless, the present article has certain limitations, mainly due to the short period from the emergence of the virus and the everincreasing body of research that have been shedding light each day. Discussion: Both COVID-19 and HUS require binding to a membrane receptor to trigger the pathophysiological mechanism. Despite the evident difference in tropism, both conditions develop with severe endothelial dysfunction, microangiopathy and important inflammatory response, responsible for MODS. The role of the coagulation pathway is more significant in COVID-19 but less in HUS. Excessive complement activation appears to be a determinant of severe prognosis in both diseases. Regarding COVID-19, children have a milder symptomatology than adults, but in some cases the paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) is described.;"https://doi.org/10.26574/maedica.2020.15.3.376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312255/";1/9/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9933
2060;Assessing the immediate impact of COVID-19 on surgical oncology practice: Experience from an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the Northeastern United States.;10.1002/jso.26475;"BACKGROUND The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on surgical oncology practice are not yet quantified. The aim of this study was to measure the immediate impact of COVID-19 on surgical oncology practice volume. METHODS A retrospective study of patients treated at an NCI-Comprehensive Cancer Center was performed. ""Pre-COVID"" era was defined as January-February 2020 and ""COVID"" as March-April 2020. Primary outcomes were clinic visits and operative volume by surgical oncology subspecialty. RESULTS Abouyt 907 new patient visits, 3897 follow-up visits, and 644 operations occurred during the study period. All subspecialties experienced significant decreases in new patient visits during COVID, though soft tissue oncology (Mel/Sarc), gynecologic oncology (Gyn/Onc), and endocrine were disproportionately affected. Telehealth visits increased to 11.4% of all visits by April. Mel/Sarc, Gyn/Onc, and Breast experienced significant operative volume decreases during COVID (25.8%, p = 0.012, 43.6% p < 0.001, and 41.9%, p < 0.001, respectively), while endocrine had no change and gastrointestinal oncology had a slight increase (p = 0.823) in the number of cases performed. CONCLUSIONS The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are wide-ranging within surgical oncology subspecialties. The addition of telehealth is a viable avenue for cancer patient care and should be considered in surgical oncology practice.";"https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33765341/";25/3/2021;25.8%;0.9547
