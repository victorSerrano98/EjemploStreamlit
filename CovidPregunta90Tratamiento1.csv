As a response plan, numerous governments are turning toward economic mechanisms to support both local and national economies. While those are hailed, as the number for unemployment rises, economic stimulus packages are in essence a short-term solution but with the potential to impact on the long-term socioeconomic fabric. In this respect, if not carefully crafted, those emergency economic packages can bailout heavy and polluting industries, hence posing a long-term problem for the actualization of sustainability agendas and commitments. This chapter explores this scenario, supported by trends from past recessions, and further outlines the need for short-term economic emergency response plans while keeping in line with long-term sustainability needs.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128243138000073; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128243138000073";24/07/2020;coronavirus;0.9191

When a Taser is triggered, compressed gas propels two barbs with trailing insulated wires which deliver a pulsed electrical discharge on contact. A 51-year-old man presented with a single barb of the Taser embedded in the diaphysis of the proximal phalanx and an associated open fracture. The barb was removed under local anaesthesia. The fracture was stable and was mobilised in a flexible splint. Oral antibiotics were commenced in recognition of the risk of flexor sheath and bone inoculation. While the most severe complications associated with Taser are related to the electrical component, the most common injuries are associated with falls and barb penetrations.

First, given the unique structural characteristics of Met, two chemical modification methods are briefly introduced. Subsequently, due to the disordered metabolic state of tumor cells, applications of Met in cancer treatment and diagnosis are summarized in detail. Furthermore, the efficacy of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), as the most important metabolic derivative of Met, for treating liver diseases is mentioned. Finally, we analyze the current challenges and development trends of Met in the biomedical field, and suggest that Met-restriction therapy might be a promising approach to treat COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1039/d0bm02180f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33537687/";04/02/2021;Met-restriction therapy;0.9529
36;Usefulness of machine learning in COVID-19 for the detection and prognosis of cardiovascular complications.;10.31083/j.rcm.2020.03.120;Since January 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global concern, and its cardiovascular manifestations have highlighted the need for fast, sensitive and specific tools for early identification and risk stratification. Machine learning is a software solution with the ability to analyze large amounts of data and make predictions without prior programming. When faced with new problems with unique challenges as evident in the COVID-19 pandemic, machine learning can offer solutions that are not apparent on the surface by sifting quickly through massive quantities of data and making associations that may have been missed. Artificial intelligence is a broad term that encompasses different tools, including various types of machine learning and deep learning. Here, we review several cardiovascular applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence and their potential applications to cardiovascular diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in COVID-19 infection.;"https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm.2020.03.120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070540/";30/09/2020;therapy;0.971
37;Prediction and control of COVID-19 infection based on a hybrid intelligent model;10.1101/2020.10.22.20218032;The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that emerged in the late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and it has caused a worldwide outbreak, which represents a major threat to global health. It is important to design prediction research and control strategies to crush its exploding. In this study, a hybrid intelligent model is proposed to simulate the spreading dynamics of COVID-19. First, considering the control measures, such as government investment, media publicity, medical treatment and law enforcement. The infection rates are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA), then a modified susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered (SIQR) model is proposed, then the long short-term memory (LSTM) is imbedded into the SIQR model to design the hybrid intelligent model to further optimize other parameters of the system model to obtain the optimal predictive model and control measures. This study provide a reliable model to predict cases of infection and death, and reasonable suggestion to control COVID-19.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20218032v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.22.20218032";27/10/2020;medical treatment;0.9209
38;Social Distancing During the COVID‐19 Pandemic: Who Are the Present and Future Non‐compliers?;10.1111/puar.13240;Social distancing is an effective means for containing the spread of COVID‐19, but only so if we all participate. Who are the individuals who are the least likely to adhere to social distancing recommendations, presently and in the long‐term? Such knowledge is important for policymakers looking to sustain the public's buy‐in to social distancing. Using survey data from sample U.S. residents (n = 1,449), we show that some demographic factors (gender, age, race, political party) help predict intent to adhere to social distancing. Yet demographic factors are relatively poor predictors compared to individual attitudes and media diets. We argue that public officials should make efforts to inform and persuade the public of the importance of social distancing, targeting mediums like TV and radio where audiences are less likely to currently engage in social distancing or are less likely to envision themselves sustaining strict social distancing for several weeks or months.

39;Understanding and Addressing Latinx COVID-19 Disparities in Washington State.;10.1177/1090198120963099;The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed, and intensified, health inequities faced by Latinx in the United States. Washington was one of the first U.S. states to report cases of COVID-19. Public health surveillance shows that 31% of Washington cases are Latinx, despite being only 13% of the state population. Unjust policies related to immigration, labor, housing, transportation, and education have contributed to both past and existing inequities. Approximately 20% of Latinx are uninsured, leading to delays in testing and medical care for COVID-19, and early reports indicated critical shortages in professional interpreters and multilingual telehealth options. Washington State is taking action to address some of these inequities. Applying a health equity framework, we describe key factors contributing to COVID-19-related health inequities among Latinx populations, and how Washington State has aimed to address these inequities. We draw on these experiences to make recommendations for other Latinx communities experiencing COVID-19 disparities.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/1090198120963099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33148042/";01/12/2020;medical care;0.9032
40;Neighbourhood income and physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.;10.1038/s41562-020-00998-2;Physical distancing has been the primary strategy to control COVID-19 in the United States. We used mobility data from a large, anonymized sample of smartphone users to assess the relationship between neighbourhood income and physical distancing during the pandemic. We found a strong gradient between neighbourhood income and physical distancing. Individuals in high-income neighbourhoods increased their days at home substantially more than individuals in low-income neighbourhoods did. Residents of low-income neighbourhoods were more likely to work outside the home, compared to residents in higher-income neighbourhoods, but were not more likely to visit locations such as supermarkets, parks and hospitals. Finally, we found that state orders were only associated with small increases in staying home in low-income neighbourhoods. Our findings indicate that people in lower-income neighbourhoods have faced barriers to physical distancing, particularly needing to work outside the home, and that state physical distancing policies have not mitigated these disparities.;"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-00998-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33144713/";03/11/2020;Physical distancing;0.9641
41;Coronavirus: Hotspot on coronavirus disease 2019 in India;10.25259/ijms_33_2020;The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or also known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized as the cause of respiratory infection in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019. As of April 5, 2020, this epidemic had spread to worldwide with 12,03,485 confirmed cases, including 62,000 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Global Public Health Crisis. Coronavirus causes respiratory illness coughing, sneezing, breathlessness, and fever including pneumonia. The disease is transmitted person to person through infected droplets. At present, the research on novel coronavirus is still in the primary stage. Based on the published study, we thoroughly summarize the history and origin, microbiology and taxonomy, mode of transmissions, target receptor, clinical features, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment about COVID-19. This short report writes in hope for providing platform to community and researcher dealings against with the novel coronavirus and providing a reference for further studies.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217275/;30/04/2020;treatment;0.9431
42;Invisible No More: The Impact of COVID-19 on Essential Food Production Workers.;10.1080/1059924x.2020.1814925;From the farms to the packing plants, essential workers in critical food production industries keep food on our tables while risking their and their families' health and well-being to bring home a paycheck. They work in essential industries but are often invisible. The disparities illuminated by COVID-19 are not new. Instead, they are the result of years of inequities built into practices, policies, and systems that reinforce societal power structures. As a society, we are now at an antagonizing moment where we can change our collective trajectory to focus forward and promote equity and justice for workers in agriculture and food-related industries. To that end, we describe our experience and approach in addressing COVID-19 outbreaks in meat processing facilities, which included three pillars of action based on public health ethics and international human rights: (1) worksite prevention and control, (2) community-based prevention and control, and (3) treatment. Our approach can be translated to promote the health, safety, and well-being of the broader agricultural workforce.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924x.2020.1814925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32945241/";18/09/2020;treatment;0.9429
43;A Tale of Two Crises: The 2008 Mortgage Meltdown and the 2020 COVID-19 Crisis;10.1093/rapstu/raaa019;"The causes and consequences of the 2008 mortgage meltdown and 2020 COVID-19 crisis are quite different: the 2008 mortgage meltdown reflected infection of the financial system due to excess leverage and poor-quality mortgage loans, and the recent crisis reflects a substantial global economic shock to contain the viral outbreak of the coronavirus. Yet the financial and medical systems share many elements, such as opacity and interconnectedness as well as adequate buffers and reserves. We examine these themes as well as asset pricing, moral hazard (though it was at the root of the crisis only in the Great Recession), the consequences for government as a systemic actor, economic concentration, and capital market regulation in the two crises. In both crises, interventions in financial markets and disruptions in the housing market played important, but differing, roles. The recent crisis elucidates open questions about the foundation of financial economics and risk sharing.

44;Dynamics of Public Spending on Health and Socio-Economic Development in the European Union: An Analysis from the Perspective of the Sustainable Development Goals;10.3390/healthcare9030353;In recent years, healthcare has become a fundamental pillar of the level of well-being of any society. With the aim of improving the lives of countries and societies, in 2015 the United Nations (UN) approved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Among the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out in the Agenda are health and well-being (O3) and the reduction of inequalities (O10). The general objective of this paper is to analyse the impact that the level of socioeconomic development, as well as the evolution of inequalities, have had on public spending on health in European Union countries. The research methodology is based on the application of a regression model and statistical techniques such as sigma convergence, beta convergence and the Gini index. We can see that the levels of public spending on health per capita, the level of socio-economic development and the degree of inequality are closely related in these countries. For this reason, we suggest maintaining sustainable economic growth to reduce the economic disparities between EU countries, and also the current differences in public spending on health per capita.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33804622/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9030353";20/03/2021;healthcare;0.9163
45;Perspectives of a 2nd-year medical student on 'Students as Partners' in higher education - What are the benefits, and how can we manage the power dynamics?;10.1080/0142159x.2020.1779922;"The 'Students as Partners' model has been redefining the way we see student-staff relationships in Higher Education. In a world where hierarchical teaching and learning has dominated for decades, this concept has been refreshing. I have seen the benefits first-hand, having participated in a 2-week student-staff collaboration to redesign the year-one medical curriculum at the Imperial College School of Medicine. However, inherent to such partnerships can be imbalanced power dynamics, which may pose a barrier and prevent the project from achieving its potential. The sources and impacts of these power dynamics are complex and the solutions multi-faceted. In our project, these imbalances of power were mitigated because the correct steps were taken both by the educators, as well as by the organisation. We produced outputs that led to significant change in the curriculum, in the short space of 2 weeks. I attribute this largely to the careful management of power dynamics throughout. In the current milieu of COVID-19, student-staff collaboration will be a valuable source of research; mitigating the impacts of power dynamics will undoubtedly improve productivity and motivation.";"https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2020.1779922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33086905/";17/06/2020;medical;0.91

To assess safety, we conducted a retrospective chart review evaluating mortality and other patient safety outcomes after implementation of the NCRP protocol (April 3, 2020, to April 15, 2020) for adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, compared with preimplementation outcomes (March 15, 2020, to April 2, 2020). During the study, there were 469 COVID-19 admissions. Fewer patients underwent intubation after implementation (10.7% [23 of 215]), compared with before implementation (25.2% [64 of 254]) (P < .01). Overall, 26.2% of patients died (24% before implementation vs 28.8% after implementation; P = .14). In patients without a do not resuscitate/do not intubate order prior to admission, mortality was 21.8% before implementation vs 21.9% after implementation.
