0;The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on psoriasis patients, and their immunosuppressive treatment: a cross-sectional multicenter study from Turkey.;10.1080/09546634.2021.1927947;"BACKGROUND Immunosuppressive therapy has been a great concern during the pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the pandemic's impact on psoriasis patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS The multicenter study was conducted in 14 tertiary dermatology centers. Demographic data, treatment status, disease course, and cases of COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with psoriasis using the immunosuppressive treatment. RESULTS Of 1827 patients included, the drug adherence rate was 68.2%. Those receiving anti-interleukin (anti-IL) drugs were more likely to continue treatment than patients receiving conventional drugs (OR = 1.50, 95% CI, 1.181-1.895, p = .001). Disease worsening rate was 24.2% and drug dose reduction increased this rate 3.26 and drug withdrawal 8.71 times. Receiving anti-TNF or anti-IL drugs was associated with less disease worsening compared to conventional drugs (p = .038, p = .032; respectively). Drug withdrawal causes were 'unable to come' (39.6%), 'COVID concern' (25.3%), and 'physician's and patient's co-decision' (17.4%). Four patients had COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms. The incidence was 0.0022% while it was 0.0025% in the general population. CONCLUSION Our study shows that psoriasis patients using systemic immunosuppressive do not have a higher, but even lower COVID-19 risk than the general population, and treatment compliance with biological drugs is higher.";"https://doi.org/10.1080/09546634.2021.1927947; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030547/";24/05/2021;concern;0.9017
1;The Effect of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Physician Assistant Educators.;10.1097/jpa.0000000000000312;PURPOSE The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has presented physician assistant (PA) educators with unprecedented challenges in delivering content remotely with minimal time to develop new pedagogical strategies. We surveyed faculty about their experience during the early weeks of adapting to these new instructional techniques. METHODS An anonymous quantitative and qualitative survey was distributed to all individuals registered by programs as Physician Assistant Education Association members. RESULTS The survey response rate was 22.3% (667/2991) with 32% of program directors (PD), and 23.7% of faculty reporting they had taught online synchronous content prior to COVID-19 adaptations. Prior experience with technology was associated with significantly lower levels of faculty stress during the pivot to online instruction. A majority of the respondents felt educational quality had remained consistent despite the transition to online teaching, and a majority of both faculty and program directors anticipate only minor changes to program structure once they are able to return to traditional classroom learning. Concerns about technology were most commonly cited as stressors and as causes of decreased quality of instruction. CONCLUSION Educational challenges and stress during the pandemic were most prominently associated with unfamiliar technology. It remains to be seen what changes persist when the pandemic subsides.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/jpa.0000000000000312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32732664/";28/07/2020;coronavirus;0.9877
2;Understanding Economic and Health Factors Impacting the Spread of COVID-19 Disease;10.1101/2020.04.10.20058222;The rapid spread of the Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) had drastically impacted life all over the world. While some economies are actively recovering from this pestilence, others are experiencing fast and consistent disease spread, compelling governments to impose social distancing measures that have put a halt on routines, especially in densely-populated areas. Aiming at bringing more light on key economic and public health factors affecting the disease spread, this initial study utilizes a quantitative statistical analysis based on the most recent publicly-available COVID-19 datasets. The study had shown and explained multiple significant relationships between the COVID-19 data and other country-level statistics. We have also identified and statistically profiled four major country-level clusters with relation to different aspects of COVID-19 development and country-level economic and health indicators. Specifically, this study has identified potential COVID-19 under-reporting traits as well as various economic factors that impact COVID-19 Diagnosis, Reporting, and Treatment. Based on the country clusters, we have also described the four disease development scenarios, which are tightly knit to country-level economic and public health factors. Finally, we have highlighted the potential limitation of reporting and measuring COVID-19 and provided recommendations on further in-depth quantitative research.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20058222;11/04/2020;Coronavirus 2019 disease;0.9195
3;In silico identification of RBD subdomain of spike protein from Pro(322)-Thr(581) for applications in vaccine development against SARS-CoV2;10.1016/j.molstruc.2021.130534;The three-dimensional hybrid structures of coronavirus spike proteins including the C-terminal sequence and receptor binding motif (RBM) was remodeled and energy minimized. Further, protein-protein docking show that Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARSCoV 2 Lys(457)-Pro(490) bind on the surface of ACE2 receptor near N-terminal helices to form host-pathogen attachment. In this binding interface, SARS-CoV 2 shows a tight network of hydrogen bonds than other spike proteins from BtRsRaTG13-CoV, SARS-CoV, BtRsBeta-CoV, BtRsCoV-related, Pangolin-CoV (PCoV), human-CoV (hCoV), MERS-CoV (MCoV), Avian-CoV (ACoV) and PEDV1-CoV. Further studies show that subdomains from SARS-CoV 2 RBD Pro(322)-Thr(581), SARS-CoV RBD Pro(309)-Pro(575), BtRsRaTG13 RBD Thr(581)-Thr(323), BtRsBeta-CoV RBD Ser(311)-Thr(568), BtRsCoV-related Arg(306)-Pro(575) and PCoV RBD Gln(319)-Ser(589) show binding conformations with ACE2 like their full-length structures of spike proteins. In addition, the subdomains MCoV RBD Gly(372)-Val(616), ACoV RBD Gly(372)-Val(616) and PEDV1-CoV RBD Ala(315)-Tyr(675) also binds on the surface of ACE2 similar to their full-length spike proteins. The B-Cell epitope mapping also identified main antigenic determinants predicting that these nine subdomains are highly useful in recombinant vaccine development in inducing cross neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV 2 spike protein and inhibits its attachment with ACE2.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967342/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286021006670?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022286021006670; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2021.130534";30/04/2021;Receptor Binding Domain;0.9607
4;Antibodies at work in the time of SARS-CoV-2;10.1016/j.jcyt.2020.08.009;Even after a decade of continuous emergence of coronaviruses, there aren't any licenced vaccines or therapeutics against the deadly infection. The age-old passive immunization with protective antibodies to neutralize the virus is one of the strategies for emergency prophylaxis and therapy for COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the up-to-date advances in immune-based therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma therapy as the first line of defences to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been established with encouraging results. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or blocking the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor have been found very promising as the countermeasure to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 infection, though clinical trials are underway. Considering the counterproductive antibody-dependent enhancement of the virus, the mAbs therapy that is safe and efficacious even in people with an underlying condition will be a significant breakthrough. The emerging immunotherapeutic interventions using nanobodies and cellular immunotherapy are also the promising avenues to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss the implication of mAbs against mediators of cytokine storm syndrome to modify the immune response of COVID-19 patients, thus reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2020.08.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32988772/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S146532492030846X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S146532492030846X?v=s5";31/08/2020;immune-based therapy;0.9439
5;Disrupted classes, undisrupted learning during COVID-19 outbreak in China: application of open educational practices and resources;10.1186/s40561-020-00125-8;With the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China, the Chinese government decided to ban any type of face-to-face teaching, disrupting classes and resulting in over 270 million students being unable to return to their universities/schools. Therefore, the Ministry of Education (MoE) launched an initiative titled ‘Ensuring learning undisrupted when classes are disrupted’ by reforming the entire educational system and including an online education component. However, this quick reform in this unexpected critical situation of widespread COVID-19 cases harbours several challenges, such as the lack of time and teacher/student isolation. This paper discusses the possibility of using open educational resources (OER) and open educational practices (OEP) as an effective educational solution to overcome these challenges. Particularly, this study presents a generic OEP framework built on existing open-practice definitions. It then presents, based on this framework and based on the challenges reported by several Chinese education specialists during two national online seminars, a set of guidelines for the effective use of OER and OEP for both teaching and learning. Finally, this study presents some recommendations for the better adoption of OER and OEP in the future. The findings of this study can help researchers and educators apply OER and OEP for better learning experiences and outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7336082/;06/07/2020;coronavirus;0.9571
6;Rapid and Sensitive Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Label-Free Manner Using Micromechanical Sensors.;10.3390/s21134439;"Coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified as a deadly pandemic. The genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is performed using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique for identifying viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in infected patients. However, the RT-PCR diagnostic technique is manually laborious and expensive; therefore, it is not readily accessible in every laboratory. Methodological simplification is crucial to combat the ongoing pandemic by introducing quick, efficient, and affordable diagnostic methods. Here, we report how microcantilever sensors offer promising opportunities for rapid COVID-19 detection. Our first attempt was to capture the single-stranded complementary DNA of SARS-CoV-2 through DNA hybridization. Therefore, the microcantilever surface was immobilized with an oligonucleotide probe and detected using complementary target DNA hybridization by a shift in microcantilever resonance frequency. Our results show that microcantilever sensors can discriminate between complementary and noncomplementary target DNA on a micro to nanoscale. Additionally, the microcantilever sensors' aptitude toward partial complementary DNA determines their potential to identify new variants of coronavirus. Therefore, microcantilever sensing could be a vital tool in the effort to extinguish the spreading COVID-19 pandemic.";"https://doi.org/10.3390/s21134439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209484/";29/06/2021;Coronavirus;0.918
7;Dataset of enhanced UV-C emitting properties of Pr(3+)-activated rare earth phosphates driven by structural lattice distortion through a substitutional doping strategy;10.1016/j.dib.2021.107145;Ongoing global pandemic crisis of coronavirus (COVID-19) and its fast- and wide-spreading into entire worlds, critically intimidating our current and future lives, put more emphasis on the development of efficient UV-C emitting phosphors for the germicidal and medical applications due to the intense UV-C emission, which can effectively deactivate such viruses. In this regard, UV-C emitting Pr(3+)-activated three presentative rare earth phosphate such as YPO(4), LaPO(4), and La (x mol.%, x =0-0.21)-doped YPO(4) have been systematically investigated in terms of crystallographic evolution and their impact on the UV-C emitting properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images along with X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns attested the substitutional doping of La into YPO(4) host matrices. Optical properties mainly investigated using the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy in the spectral range from 220-300 nm corresponding to UV-C energy region clearly demonstrated that the substitutional doping of La into YPO(4):Pr(3+) leads to the increase in transition probability of UV-C emission, resulted from the electronic transition of activator corresponding to [Xe]4f(1)5d(1)→[Xe]4f(2). The data presented here are related to the research article entitled “Structural distortion induced enhancement in UV-C emitting properties of Pr(3+)-activated La-substituted yttrium phosphates (Y(1-)(x)La(x)PO(4):Pr(3+))”.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.107145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113700/";17/05/2021;coronavirus;0.9566
8;Is Gluten the Only Culprit for Non-Celiac Gluten/Wheat Sensitivity?;10.3390/nu12123785;The gluten-free diet (GFD) has gained increasing popularity in recent years, supported by marketing campaigns, media messages and social networks. Nevertheless, real knowledge of gluten and GF-related implications for health is still poor among the general population. The GFD has also been suggested for non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS), a clinical entity characterized by intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms induced by gluten ingestion in the absence of celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). NCG/WS should be regarded as an “umbrella term” including a variety of different conditions where gluten is likely not the only factor responsible for triggering symptoms. Other compounds aside from gluten may be involved in the pathogenesis of NCG/WS. These include fructans, which are part of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and glyphosate. The GFD might be an appropriate dietary approach for patients with self-reported gluten/wheat-dependent symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet (LFD) should be the first dietary option for patients referring symptoms more related to FODMAPs than gluten/wheat and the second-line treatment for those with self-reported gluten/wheat-related symptoms not responding to the GFD. A personalized approach, regular follow-up and the help of a skilled dietician are mandatory.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33321805/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12123785";10/12/2020;gluten-free diet;0.9237
9;Productivity loss/gain in cost-effectiveness analyses for vaccines: a systematic review.;10.1080/14737167.2021.1881484;INTRODUCTION The kinds of costs included in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) for vaccines, such as direct medical costs and indirect costs, may affect their outcomes. While some guidelines recommend inclusion of costs associated with productivity losses/gains, very little guidance is provided about the productivity elements to include and their calculation approach. Areas covered: We conducted a systematic review of CEAs for vaccines and vaccine programs published between 1 January 2010 and 19 November 2019 that included productivity costs using Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The kind of productivity elements included their calculation approach, and the impact of their inclusion on cost-effectiveness are summarized. Among 88 studies identified, productivity elements included were reported for 71 studies (81%) with absenteeism being the most commonly included element. Only 24 studies (27%) reported the approach used to calculate productivity costs (human capital vs. friction approach). Most studies (81%) reported a more favorable cost-effectiveness with the inclusion of productivity losses/gains. Expert opinion: Inclusion of productivity losses/gains for CEAs for vaccines has resulted in more favorable cost-effectiveness based on the studies reviewed. However, clearer guidance on the productivity elements to include by disease area and more transparency on the calculation method used may be needed.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1881484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593223/";16/02/2021;cost-effectiveness analyses;0.9236
10;Factors affecting women entrepreneurs’ success: a study of small- and medium-sized enterprises in emerging market of Pakistan;10.1186/s13731-021-00145-9;In the present era, women are recognized as successful entrepreneurs through their strong desire, qualities, and capabilities for robust economic development. Due to such an important contribution of women in economic development, we propose to investigate the factors which affect women entrepreneur’s success in Pakistan. Data were collected through structured questionnaires from 181 registered SMEs operating in Pakistan. A conceptual model is developed, while SPSS and AMOS software’s are used for analysis. The results indicate that the internal factors including the need for achievements, risk-taking, and self-confidence and external factors including economic factors and socio-cultural factors have a positive and significant influence on the success of women-owned enterprises. This research recommends Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA), policymakers, and practitioners to encourage women entrepreneurs to run their businesses for the long term by providing a variety of incentives and supports related to those internal and external factors. Numerous studies have been conducted to test the different factors’ effects on women’s entrepreneurial success, but our study investigated some psychological, cultural, and religious factors that are still almost untouched especially in Pakistan. The current study also contributes to the existing literature through empirical shreds of evidence.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33686362/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13731-021-00145-9";03/03/2021;Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority;0.901
11;Sialylation of host proteins as targetable risk factor for COVID‐19 susceptibility and spreading: A hypothesis;10.1096/fba.2020-00073;Individuals infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐related coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) develop a critical and even fatal disease, called Coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19), that eventually evolves into acute respiratory distress syndrome. The gravity of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic, the escalating number of confirmed cases around the world, the many unknowns related to the virus mode of action, and the heterogenous outcome of COVID‐19 disease in the population ask for the rapid development of alternative approaches, including repurposing of existing drugs, that may dampen virus infectivity. SARS‐CoV‐2 infects human cells through interaction with sialylated receptors at the surface of epithelial cells, such as angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Glycan composition on virus entry receptors has been shown to influence the rate of infection of SARS‐CoV‐2 and spreading of virions has recently been linked to altered lysosomal exocytosis. These processes could concurrently involve the lysosomal system and its glycosidases. We hypothesize that modulating the activity of one of them, the lysosomal sialidase NEU1, could impinge on both the sialylation status of ACE2 and other host receptors as well as the extent of lysosomal exocytosis. Thus NEU1‐controlled pathways may represent therapeutic targets, which could impact on SARS‐CoV‐2 susceptibility, infectivity, and spread.;"https://doi.org/10.1096/fba.2020-00073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33733058/";13/01/2021;Coronavirus disease‐19;0.9863
12;Practical and Ethical Concerns in Implementing Enhanced Surveillance Methods to Improve Continuity of HIV Care: Qualitative Expert Stakeholder Study;10.2196/19891;BACKGROUND: Retention in HIV care is critical to maintaining viral suppression and preventing further transmission, yet less than 50% of people living with HIV in the United States are engaged in care. All US states have a funding mandate to implement Data-to-Care (D2C) programs, which use surveillance data (eg, laboratory, Medicaid billing) to identify out-of-care HIV-positive persons and relink them to treatment. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify and describe practical and ethical considerations that arise in planning for and implementing D2C. METHODS: Via purposive sampling, we recruited 43 expert stakeholders—including ethicists, privacy experts, researchers, public health personnel, HIV medical providers, legal experts, and community advocates—to participate in audio-recorded semistructured interviews to share their perspectives on D2C. Interview transcripts were analyzed across a priori and inductively derived thematic categories. RESULTS: Stakeholders reported practical and ethical concerns in seven key domains: permission and consent, government assistance versus overreach, privacy and confidentiality, stigma, HIV exceptionalism, criminalization, and data integrity and sharing. CONCLUSIONS: Participants expressed a great deal of support for D2C, yet also stressed the role of public trust and transparency in addressing the practical and ethical concerns they identified.;"https://doi.org/10.2196/19891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886069/";04/09/2020;Retention in HIV care;0.9605
13;Psychometric characteristics of the of COVID Stress Scales-Arabic version (CSS-Arabic) in Egyptian and Saudi university students;10.1186/s43045-021-00095-8;BACKGROUND: Mental health sufferings due to the COVID-19 pandemic were reported in many countries worldwide. However, there is a lack of a validated Arabic tool to measure stress related to this pandemic in the Arab countries. This study aims to translate into Arabic and measure the psychometric characteristics of the previously developed English COVID Stress Scales (CSS). Using a forward-backward translation, the CSS was translated into Arabic and 22 jurors assessed its content validity. An online-based survey was carried out among 1080 university students (Egyptian and Saudi) to assess internal consistency and validity of the Arabic version (CSS-Arabic) using Cronbach’s α and factor analysis. RESULTS: The content validity indices of the scale were 0.943 and 0.932 for both relevance and clarity. The internal consistency of the total CSS-Arabic was satisfactory (with α = 0.94) within the acceptable range for different subscales. Confirmatory factor analysis reveals 5-factor model with 36 retained items similar to the original English CSS. CONCLUSIONS: CSS-Arabic is a reliable and valid self-reporting tool for screening of stress due to COVID-19 among the university students. Further work should be done by healthcare providers to assess the magnitude of the stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

14;Oral nano-curcumin formulation efficacy in management of mild to moderate hospitalized coronavirus disease-19 patients: An open label nonrandomized clinical trial.;10.1002/ptr.7004;Curcumin is proposed as a potential treatment option for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) by inhibiting the virus entrance, encapsulation and replication, and modulating various cellular signaling pathways. In this open-label nonrandomized clinical trial, efficacy of nano-curcumin oral formulation has been evaluated in hospitalized patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. Forty-one patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were allocated to nano-curcumin (n = 21) group (Sinacurcumin soft gel, contains 40 mg curcuminoids as nanomicelles, two capsules twice a day) or control (n = 20) group, for 2 weeks. Patients' symptoms and laboratory data were assessed at baseline and during follow-up period. Most of symptoms including fever and chills, tachypnea, myalgia, and cough resolved significantly faster in curcumin group. Moreover, SaO2 was significantly higher in treatment group after 2, 4, 7, and 14 days of follow-up and lymphocyte count after 7 and 14 days. Duration of supplemental O2 use and hospitalization was also meaningfully shorter in treatment group. It is also noteworthy to mention that no patient in treatment group experienced deterioration of infection during follow-up period, but it occurred in 40% of control group. Oral curcumin nano-formulation can significantly improve recovery time in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Further randomized placebo controlled trials with larger sample size are recommended.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.7004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389761/";03/01/2021;coronavirus disease-19;0.9516

METHODS: We collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China. RESULTS: Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged; the incubation period was 3–7 days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3–38.0 °C). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others had ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) were exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir because of adverse effects, two of them deteriorated, one was hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir use. Levels of potassium, albumin, and lymphocytes were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3–14, 6–8 and 7–9 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of COVID-19 improvement.

16;Characterizing and Forecasting Emergency Department Visits Related to COVID-19 Using Chief Complaints and Discharge Diagnoses;10.1101/2020.06.01.20116772;In response to the unprecedented public health challenge posed by the SARS CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) in the United States, we and our colleagues at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) have developed a model of COVID-19 progression using emergency department (ED) visit data from the National Capital Region (NCR). We obtained ED visits counts through targeted queries of the NCR Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE). To focus on ED visits by COVID-19 patients, we adjusted the query results for typical ED visit volumes and for reductions in ED volumes due to COVID-19 precautions. With these ED visit data, we fitted a logistic growth model to characterize and forecast the increase in cumulative COVID-19 ED visits. Our model achieves the best fit when we assume that the first NCR visit occurred in early January. We estimate that approximately 15,000 COVID-19 ED visits occurred prior to May 2020 and that approximately 17,000 more visits will occur in subsequent months. We plan to deploy an operational pilot of this model in the NCR ESSENCE environment, assisting local public health authorities as they brace for a second wave of COVID-19. Additionally, we will iteratively assess potential model refinements, aiming to maximize the relevance of our model for the situational awareness and decision-making of local public health authorities.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.20116772v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.01.20116772";03/06/2020;SARS CoV-2 virus;0.9457
17;Prenatal Alcohol Exposure in Rats Diminishes Postnatal Cxcl16 Chemokine Ligand Brain Expression;10.3390/brainsci10120987;Maternal ethanol consumption during pregnancy is one of the main causes of Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) produces several adverse manifestations. Even low or moderate intake has been associated with long-lasting behavioral and cognitive impairment in offspring. In this study we examined the gene expression profile in the rat nucleus accumbens using microarrays, comparing animals exposed prenatally to ethanol and controls. Microarray gene expression showed an overall downward regulatory effect of PAE. Gene cluster analysis reveals that the gene groups most affected are related to transcription regulation, transcription factors and homeobox genes. We focus on the expression of the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 16 (Cxcl16) which was differentially expressed. There is a significant reduction in the expression of this chemokine throughout the brain under PAE conditions, evidenced here by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Chemokines are involved in neuroprotection and implicated in alcohol-induced brain damage and neuroinflammation in the developing central nervous system (CNS), therefore, the significance of the overall decrease in Cxcl16 expression in the brain as a consequence of PAE may reflect a reduced ability in neuroprotection against subsequent conditions, such as excitotoxic damage, inflammatory processes or even hypoxic-ischemic insult.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33333834/; https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10120987";15/12/2020;Neurodevelopmental disorders;0.9922

The current treatment strategy relies on the extensive usage of classical inactivated vaccine which is marred by large doses, short immunization cycles and safety concerns. METHODS: The present study aimed at optimization of RDPV VP2 gene, subcloning the gene into plasmid pET30a, and its subsequent transfer to Escherichia coli with trigger factor 16 for co-expression. The protein thus expressed was purified with ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic chromatography, and endotoxin extraction procedures. VLPs were examined by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and the efficacy of VLPs vaccine was tested in vivo. RESULTS: Results indicated that RDPV VP2 protein could be expressed soluble. Transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering results indicated that RDPV VP2 self-assembled into VLPs. Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers elicited by Al(OH)(3) adjuvanted RDPV VLPs were comparable with RDPV inactivated vaccines, and the viral loads in the blood of the struck raccoon dogs were greatly reduced. Hematoxylin and eosin and Immunohistochemical results indicated that RDPV VLPs vaccine could protect raccoon dogs against RDPV infections. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that RDPV VLPs can become a potential vaccine candidate for RDPV therapy.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8047598/;15/04/2021;Raccoon dog parvovirus;0.9129
19;Recent Advances in Discovery of Potent Proteases Inhibitors Targeting the SARS Coronaviruses.;10.2174/1568026620999201111160035;Across the globe, countries are being challenged by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in ways they have never been before. Global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 with an uncertain fatality rate has imposed extreme challenges on global health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, after the disease caused by the new coronavirus spread to more than 100 countries. To date, various therapeutic approaches has been proposed and are being implemented to combat this pandemic, but unfortunately, no sovereign remedy has been es-tablished yet. Protease enzymes are important targets to develop therapies for the treatment of infections caused by SARS coronaviruses. In this review, an overview is given on recent advances in discovery of potent protease inhibitors targeting the SARS coronaviruses. Different classes of natural product inhibitors targeting protease enzymes of SARS coronaviruses have been studied in detail along with their structure activity relationship analysis. This study emphasized on important covalent and non-covalent small molecule inhibitors which effectively inhibited chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) of two SARS coronaviruses i.e. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Repurposing of drugs has been also outlined in this study to understand their roles as quick-to-be-identified therapy to combat these zoonotic coronaviruses.;"https://doi.org/10.2174/1568026620999201111160035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33183205/";11/11/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9666
20;Infections after hematopoietic cell transplantation are not a burden for mortality at a limited-resource center in a developing country.;10.1111/tid.13414;BACKGROUND Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) outcomes, including infectious complications, change between centers and countries. Thus, the aim of this study was to report the incidence of infections and isolated pathogens among recipients of HCT and the association with mortality at a tertiary referral center in Mexico. METHODS Two hundred and eighty-two patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic HCT between January 2005 and December 2018 at the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, were included. RESULTS In autologous HCT (n=176), within the preengraftment and the early postengraftment, 130 (74%) and 31 (18%) recipients presented infections, respectively. Within the preengraftment, the early postengraftment, and the late postengraftment, 81 (76%), 34 (33%), and 58 (60%) allogeneic HCT recipients presented infections, respectively. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) as a result of infections occurred in 1 (0.6%) and 5 (5%) autologous and allogeneic HCT recipients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrated that despite our limited resources, infections were not a significant burden for NRM among HCT recipients. More importantly, the isolation rates were higher than international studies, which could be explained by the existence of a specialized infectious diseases department and laboratory, which we consider key elements for the establishment of an HCT program worldwide.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668082/";15/07/2020;Hematopoietic cell transplantation;0.9083

The objective of this study was to use the digital image processing method to identify alveolar lesions in the lungs of rats submitted to chronic 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) inhalation exposure. We used forty adult male Wistar rats. The rats were divided into four groups: control group (CG), low concentration group (LCG), medium concentration group (MCG), and high concentration group (HCG). In a 6-month exposure period, we used two boxes connected to ultrasonic nebulizers for herbicide spraying. After this period, the rats were euthanized for the collection and study of lung tissue. For each image, counts of injuries and blisters were performed automatically using a methodology based on digital image processing techniques. For analysis of the results, an electronic database (Excel®) was created. We used the Pearson method for correlation analysis; values of p <0.05 were considered significant. In the evaluation of healthy alveoli, we recorded positive and significant correlations between analysis from a pathologist and computational analysis. In the evaluation of injured alveoli, we recorded a positive but non-significant correlation between analysis from a pathologist and computational analysis.

22;Pericardial effusion in patients with COVID-19: case series;10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa287;BACKGROUND: SARS-coronavirus-2 [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] infection is a public health issue affecting millions of people. It started in Wuhan in China in December 2019 spreading rapidly worldwide. CASE SUMMARY: Three patients aged 51–84 developed a pericarditis related to COVID-19, associated for two of them with a myocarditis. Case 1 was a COVID-19 cardiac tamponade without myocarditis, confirmed by a positive chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Case 2 showed a COVID-19 myopericarditis, confirmed by a positive chest CT scan and a SARS-coronavirus-2 positive swab. Case 3 was a cardiac tamponade due to COVID-19 pericarditis, with a positive polymerase chain reaction on pericardial fluid. They were all treated by colchicine and their condition improved rapidly. DISCUSSION: Presumably rare, we reported three cases of pericardial effusions (PEs) occurring in a single cardiology centre. There is a higher incidence of COVID-19-related cardiac diseases such as pericarditis that can manifest as a minimal PE to a cardiac tamponade, which should result in a higher awareness of cardiologists. A systematic measure of the high-sensitivity troponin kinetic in patients affected by COVID-19 could be interesting in order to screen for potential myocarditis. Any unexplained haemodynamic failure or increased cardiac biomarkers should make the medical team search for myopericarditis by a transthoracic echocardiography.;"https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33415315/";09/09/2020;single cardiology centre;0.9305
23;Combining Bioimpedance and Myographic Signals for the Assessment of COPD during Loaded Breathing.;10.1109/tbme.2020.2998009;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the most common chronic conditions. The current assessment of COPD requires a maximal maneuver during a spirometry test to quantify airflow limitations of patients. Other less invasive measurements such as thoracic bioimpedance and myographic signals have been studied as an alternative to classical methods as they provide information about respiration. Particularly, strong correlations have been shown between thoracic bioimpedance and respiratory volume. The main objective of this study is to investigate bioimpedance and its combination with myographic parameters in COPD patients to assess the applicability in respiratory disease monitoring. We measured bioimpedance, surface electromyography and surface mechanomyography in forty-three COPD patients during an incremental inspiratory threshold loading protocol. We introduced two novel features that can be used to assess COPD condition derived from the variation of bioimpedance and the electrical and mechanical activity during each respiratory cycle. These features demonstrate significant differences between mild and severe patients, indicating a lower inspiratory contribution of the inspiratory muscles to global respiratory ventilation in the severest COPD patients. In conclusion, the combination of bioimpedance and myographic signals provides useful indices to noninvasively assess the breathing of COPD patients.;"https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2020.2998009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32746014/";27/05/2020;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;0.9347
24;Extracellular vesicles from human plasma and serum are carriers of extravesicular cargo-Implications for biomarker discovery.;10.1371/journal.pone.0236439;"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) in human blood are a potential source of biomarkers. To which extent anticoagulation affects their concentration, cellular origin and protein composition is largely unexplored. To study this, blood from 23 healthy subjects was collected in acid citrate dextrose (ACD), citrate or EDTA, or without anticoagulation to obtain serum. EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation or by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) for fluorescence-SEC. EVs were analyzed by micro flow cytometry, NTA, TEM, Western blot, and protein mass spectrometry. The plasma EV concentration was unaffected by anticoagulants, but serum contained more platelet EVs. The protein composition of plasma EVs differed between anticoagulants, and between plasma and serum. Comparison to other studies further revealed that the shared EV protein composition resembles the ""protein corona"" of synthetic nanoparticles incubated in plasma or serum. In conclusion, we have validated a higher concentration of platelet EVs in serum than plasma by contemporary EV methods. Anticoagulation should be carefully described (i) to enable study comparison, (ii) to utilize available sample cohorts, and (iii) when preparing/selecting biobank samples. Further, the similarity of the EV protein corona and that of nanoparticles implicates that EVs carry both intravesicular and extravesicular cargo, which will expand their applicability for biomarker discovery.";"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32813744/";01/01/2020;acid citrate dextrose;0.9191
25;Molecular dynamics analysis of fast-spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants and their effects in the interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2;10.1101/2021.06.14.448436;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is evolving with mutations in the Spike protein, especially in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The failure of public health measures to contain the spread of the disease in many countries has given rise to novel viral variants with increased transmissibility. However, key questions about how quickly the variants can spread and whether they can cause a more severe disease remain unclear. Herein, we performed a structural investigation using molecular dynamics simulations and determined dissociation constant (KD) values using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays of three fastspreading SARS-CoV-2 variants, Alpha, Beta and Gamma ones, as well as genetic factors in the host cells that may be related to the viral infection. Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 variants facilitate their entry into the host cell by moderately increased binding affinities to the human ACE2 receptor, different torsions in hACE2 mediated by RBD variants, and an increased Spike exposure time to proteolytic enzymes. We also found that other host cell aspects, such as gene and isoform expression of key genes for the infection (ACE2, FURIN and TMPRSS2), may have few contributions to the SARS-CoV-2 variants infectivity. In summary, we concluded that a combination of viral and host cell factors allows SARS-CoV-2 variants to increase their abilities to spread faster than wild-type.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.14.448436;15/06/2021;receptor-binding domain;0.9539

AIM It was aimed to compare the symptoms of patients with COVID-19 positivity and patients without COVID-19 positivity hospitalized with suspicion of COVID-19. METHODS Patients presenting to the Sakarya University Training and Research Hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 were included in the study. Samples were obtained from the patients and PCR tests were performed; the patients were grouped as COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative; these two groups were questioned for 15 symptoms and the results were compared. RESULTS A total of 297 patients with suspicion of COVID-19 were included in the study. COVID-19 was positive in 143 patients and negative in 154 patients. The most common symptoms in the COVID-19 positive group were: cough (56.6%), weakness (56.6%), taste disorder (35.7%), myalgia (34.3%), and fever (33.6%); and in the COVID-19 negative group: cough (63%), weakness (45.5%), dyspnea (29.9%), headache (27.3%) and fever (24.7%). When these two groups were compared, taste disorder, smell disorder and diarrhea were significantly higher in the COVID-19 positive group (p = <0,00001, p = 0,00001 and p = 0,02).

All semi-urgent and elective medical care has come to a halt to conserve capacity to care for patients during this pandemic. As the numbers of COVID-19 cases decrease across Canada, our healthcare system also began to reopen various facilities and medical offices. The aim for this document is to compile the current evidence and provide expert consensus on the safe return to clinic practice in Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery. These recommendations will also summarize general precaution principles and practical tips for office across Canada to optimize patient and provider safety. Risk assessment and patient selection are crucial to minimizing exposure to COVID-19. Controversial topics such as COVID-19 mode of transmission, duration of exposure, personal protective equipment, and aerosol-generating procedures will be analyzed and discussed. Practical solutions of pre-visit office preparation, front office and examination room set-up, and check out procedures are explored. Specific considerations for audiology, pediatric population, and high risk AGMPs are also addressed.

Simple and rapid detection techniques with high sensitivity and specificity are always urgently needed. However, current nucleic acid detection techniques are still limited by traditional amplification and hybridization. To overcome this limitation, here we developed CRISPR-Cas9-assisted DNA detection (CADD). In this detection, a DNA sample is incubated with a pair of capture single guide RNAs (sgRNAs; sgRNAa and sgRNAb) specific to a target DNA, dCas9, a signal readout-related probe, and an oligo-coated solid support beads or microplate at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. During this incubation, the dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex is formed and captured on solid support by the capture sequence of sgRNAa, and the signal readout-related probe is captured by the capture sequence of sgRNAb. Finally, the detection result is reported by a fluorescent or colorimetric signal readout. This detection was verified by detecting DNA of bacteria, cancer cells, and viruses. In particular, by designing a set of sgRNAs specific to 15 high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), the HPV infection in 64 clinical cervical samples was successfully detected by the method. All detections can be finished in 30 min at RT.

However, neuropsychological assessment is not usually included as routine practice in alcohol rehabilitation programs. The aim of this study was to describe qualitatively the cognitive deficits in early-detoxified AUD patients undergoing rehabilitation and to explore relevant associations with socio-demographic, clinical and psychological factors. Patients and Methods Forty-one patients with a diagnosis of AUD were consecutively recruited from a residential rehabilitation hospital in Northern Italy. Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Brief Neuropsychological Examination 2 (ENB-2). Anxiety, depression and severity of alcohol dependence were also evaluated using validated self-report questionnaires. Alcohol relapse was investigated 1 month after discharge. Results Overall, 31.7% of AUD patients showed cognitive impairments according to the global score scale. However, 70.7% had an impaired performance on at least one test of the ENB-2, with particular regard to executive function, visuospatial and memory domains. Age, education and abstinence at admission were the most relevant factors associated with cognitive deficits in this clinical population.

This change may represent an opportunity for a different and more effective communication between professionals and patients, allowing better accessibility to medical care and more systematic and comprehensive approach to patients with hypertension and cardiovascular risk. However, organizational tools are needed to facilitate communication between patients and professionals, specifically with the exchange of clinical data by remote monitoring of variables associated with hypertension and cardiovascular risk (blood pressure, weight, height, blood tests…), and allow monitoring of adherence to treatments, lifestyles and risk factors.

Whole-genome sequencing, annotation and phylogenetic analyses of the genomes revealed that the closest relative of RIT668 is A. hydrophila ATCC 7966 and Citrobacter portucalensis A60 for RIT669. Resistome analysis showed that A. hydrophila and C. freundii harbor six and 19 different antibiotic resistance genes, respectively. Both bacteria colonize polyethylene and polypropylene, which are common plastics, found in the environment and are used to fabricate medical devices. The expression of six biofilm-related genes—biofilm peroxide resistance protein (bsmA), biofilm formation regulatory protein subunit R (bssR), biofilm formation regulatory protein subunit S (bssS), biofilm formation regulator (hmsP), toxin-antitoxin biofilm protein (tabA) and transcriptional activator of curli operon (csgD)—and two virulence factors—Vi antigen-related gene (viaB) and Shiga-like toxin (slt-II)—was investigated by RT-PCR. A. hydrophila displayed a > 2-fold increase in slt-II expression in cells adhering to both polymers, C. freundii adhering on polyethylene displayed a > 2-fold, and on polypropylene a > 6-fold upregulation of slt-II.

33;The role of case importation in explaining differences in early SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Canada - a mathematical modeling study of surveillance data;10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.046;OBJECTIVE: North American COVID-19 epidemics exhibited distinct early trajectories. In Canada, Quebec had the highest COVID-19 burden and its earlier March school break, taking place two weeks before those of the rest of the country, could have shaped early transmission dynamics. METHODS: We combined a semi-mechanistic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with detailed surveillance data from Quebec and Ontario (accounting for 85% of Canadian cases). We then explored the impact of case importation and timing of control measures on cumulative hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 1,544 and 1,150 cases among returning travelers were laboratory-confirmed in Quebec and Ontario, respectively (symptoms onset ≤2020-03-25). Hospitalizations could have been reduced by 55% (95%CrI: 51-59%) had no cases been imported after Quebec’s March break. However, had Quebec experienced Ontario’s number of introductions, hospitalizations would have only been reduced by 12% (95%CrI: 8-16%). Early public health measures mitigated epidemic spread as delaying them by one week could have resulted in twice as many hospitalizations (95%CrI: 1.7-2.1). CONCLUSION: Beyond introductions, factors such as public health preparedness, responses, and capacity could play a role in explaining interprovincial differences.

34;Cross-Project Vulnerability Prediction Based on Software Metrics and Deep Learning;10.1007/978-3-030-58811-3_62;Vulnerability prediction constitutes a mechanism that enables the identification and mitigation of software vulnerabilities early enough in the development cycle, improving the security of software products, which is an important quality attribute according to ISO/IEC 25010. Although existing vulnerability prediction models have demonstrated sufficient accuracy in predicting the occurrence of vulnerabilities in the software projects with which they have been trained, they have failed to demonstrate sufficient accuracy in cross-project prediction. To this end, in the present paper we investigate whether the adoption of deep learning along with software metrics may lead to more accurate cross-project vulnerability prediction. For this purpose, several machine learning (including deep learning) models are constructed, evaluated, and compared based on a dataset of popular real-world PHP software applications. Feature selection is also applied with the purpose to examine whether it has an impact on cross-project prediction. The results of our analysis indicate that the adoption of software metrics and deep learning may result in vulnerability prediction models with sufficient performance in cross-project vulnerability prediction. Another interesting conclusion is that the performance of the models in cross-project prediction is enhanced when the projects exhibit similar characteristics with respect to their software metrics.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974655/;19/08/2020;Vulnerability prediction;0.9157

Materials and Methods A nationwide cohort of confirmed COVID-19 (n=8,070) between January 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, and a 1:15 age-, sex-, and residence-matched cohort (n=121,050) were constructed. A nested case-control study to compare the proportion of patients with lung cancer between the COVID-19 cohort and the matched cohort. Results The proportion of patients with lung cancer was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort (0.5% [37/8,070]) than in the matched cohort (0.3% [325/121,050]) (p=0.002). The adjusted odds ratio [OR] of having lung cancer was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the matched cohort (adjusted OR = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-2.10). Among patients in the COVID-19 cohort, compared to patients without lung cancer, those with lung cancer were more likely to have severe COVID-19 (54.1% vs. 13.2%, p < 0.01), including mortality (18.5% vs. 2.8%, p < 0.01). The adjusted OR for the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer relative to those without lung cancer was 2.24 (95% CI = 1.08-4.74).

36;Managing psychological distress in children and adolescents following the COVID-19 epidemic: A cooperative approach.;10.1037/tra0000754;"Children and adolescents are susceptible to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic and tend to show posttraumatic distress. Immediately after an epidemic, governments and social organizations often provide psychological services for children and adolescents to relieve their distress. However, many adolescents report distress even long after a traumatic event because of the unaddressed traumatic atmosphere in schools or families. To advance this issue, this article proposes a cooperative model of psychological services provision for children and adolescents in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. This model suggests that psychological services should simultaneously include social, school, and family systems, which interact and have a synergistic effect. The social system provides direct services not only for children and adolescents but also for their school and family systems; school and family systems cooperate to support adolescents. Psychological work also needs to emphasize the key elements of school and family systems. Attention should be given to teachers' distress, teacher-student relationships, and peer relationships in the school system, as well as to parents' distress, parent-child relationships, and the marital relationship in the family system. In these ways, adolescents can achieve an efficient and sustainable recovery following a disaster.

37;Comparative Effectiveness of Commercial Bowel Preparations in Ambulatory Patients Presenting for Screening or Surveillance Colonoscopy.;10.1007/s10620-020-06492-z;"BACKGROUND Inadequate bowel preparation (IBP) is associated with reduced adenoma detection. However, limited research has examined the impact of different commercial bowel preparations (CBPs) on IBP and adenoma detection. We aim to determine whether type of CBP used is associated with IBP or adenoma detection. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated outpatient, screening or surveillance colonoscopies performed in the Cleveland Clinic health system between January 2011 and June 2017. IBP was defined by the Aronchick scale. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression was performed to assess the association between CBP type and IBP and adenoma detection. Fixed effects were defined as demographics, comorbidities, medication use, and colonoscopy factors. Random effect of individual endoscopist was considered. RESULTS Of 153,639 colonoscopies, 75,874 records met inclusion criteria. Median age was 54; 50% were female; 17.7% had IBP, and adenoma detection rate was 32.6%. In adjusted analyses, compared to GoLYTELY, only NuLYTELY [OR 0.66 (95% CI 0.60, 0.72)] and SuPREP [OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.40, 0.69)] were associated with reduced IBP. Adenoma detection did not vary based on the type of bowel preparation used. CONCLUSIONS Among patients referred for screening or surveillance colonoscopy, choice of CBP was not associated with adenoma detection. Decisions about CBP should be based on other factors, such as tolerability, cost, or safety.";"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06492-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691384/";20/07/2020;Inadequate bowel preparation;0.9033
38;Forced solar gazing—a common technique of torture?;10.1038/s41433-019-0742-2;BACKGROUND: Forced solar gazing (FSG) appears to be more regularly employed as a method of torture in certain parts of the world than has previously been documented. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of a case set of 17 torture survivors subjected to FSG, who were seen by the UK Charity Freedom from Torture in the period 2009–2019. RESULTS: All clients in our case set had experienced serious physical and sexual assaults, in addition to the FSG, as part of their mistreatment. All clients suffered with serious psychological conditions as a result of their torture, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These mental health conditions made ophthalmic assessment difficult, not simply because of the clients’ associated anxiety, but also because of avoidant behaviour and dissociation which was manifested in the clinical setting. In the two clients who could be examined by an ophthalmologist, both had visible retinal changes and a degree of impairment of visual acuity. CONCLUSION: FSG appears to be a method of torture which is regularly employed, and in our case set is seen with other serious manifestations of mistreatment, both physical, psychological and sexual. Psychiatric comorbidities present challenges in the clinical assessment of these cases. Ophthalmic examination can carry a risk of re-traumatisation of individuals who have experienced FSG in a context of torture.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608562/;27/02/2020;Forced solar gazing;0.934
39;Value of endoscopic examination of airways and swallowing in tracheostomy decannulation;10.1186/s43163-020-00001-9;"BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy decannulation decision is the major challenge in the clinical management of tracheostomy patients. Little evidence is available to guide the weaning process and optimal timing of tracheostomy tube removal. The purpose of the study was to investigate the value of endoscopic assessment in the tracheostomy decannulation decision. RESULTS: The study included 154 tracheostomized adult patients. Bedside assessment was done for 112 patients, and the other 42 patients were deceased. The results of bedside assessment lead to successful decannulation in 18 patients (16%), while 94 patients (84%) were unfit for decannulation. The most common cause of unfitness was aspiration and poor swallowing in 41% of patients. The endoscopic assessment was done for 59 patients out of 94 patients that were unfit for decannulation; thirteen patients of them were fit for decannulation (22%). The final status of the patients before discharge was decannulated in 31 cases and 81 patients were discharged with a tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated the importance of endoscopic assessment in the decannulation decision of tracheostomized patients. A large proportion of patients who are unfit for decannulation by bedside assessment could be fit after endoscopic assessment. Endoscopic assessment is essential particularly in tracheostomized patients who have failed to achieve decannulation through conventional protocols.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7269700/;04/06/2020;Tracheostomy decannulation decision;0.9391
40;Clinical characteristics of Egyptian male patients with COVID‐19 acute respiratory distress syndrome;10.1371/journal.pone.0249346;BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and in severe cases associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of patients with ARDS-COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study involved 197 male Egyptian participants, among them111 COVID-19 patients presented with ARDS, 60 COVID-19 patients presented with non-ARDS, and 26 Non-COVID-19 patients. We reported the analysis results of clinical and laboratory information, including blood routine tests, blood biochemistry parameters [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine and C‐reactive protein (CRP)], thrombotic activity (D‐dimer) and serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). RESULTS: The levels of hemoglobin, AST, creatinine, monocyte count, monocyte %, RBC count, TLC, and platelet count were not significantly different among the groups. The lymphopenia and increased CRP, ALT, D-dimer, ferritin, and LDH were observed in patients with ARDS-COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with ARDS presented with lymphopenia, increased thrombotic activity, increased CRP, LDH, and ferritin levels. The results revealed that CRP, D-dimer, LDH levels, and lymphopenia have a significant association with the COVID-19 severity and can be used as biomarkers to predict the disease severity.;"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861750/";16/04/2021;Coronavirus disease 2019;0.9146
41;Prone restraint cardiac arrest: A comprehensive review of the scientific literature and an explanation of the physiology.;10.1177/0025802420988370;"Deaths occurring among agitated or violent individuals subjected to physical restraint have been attributed to positional asphyxia. Restraint in the prone position has been shown to alter respiratory and cardiac physiology, although this is thought not to be to the degree that would cause asphyxia in a healthy, adult individual. This comprehensive review identifies and summarizes the current scientific literature on prone position and restraint, including experiments that assess physiology on individuals restrained in a prone position. Some of these experimental approaches have attempted to replicate situations in which prone restraint would be used. Overall, most findings revealed that individuals subjected to physical prone restraint experienced a decrease in ventilation and/or cardiac output (CO) in prone restraint. Metabolic acidosis is noted with increased physical activity, in restraint-associated cardiac arrest and simulated encounters. A decrease in ventilation and CO can significantly worsen acidosis and hemodynamics. Given these findings, deaths associated with prone physical restraint are not the direct result of asphyxia but are due to cardiac arrest secondary to metabolic acidosis compounded by inadequate ventilation and reduced CO. As such, the cause of death in these circumstances would be more aptly referred to as ""prone restraint cardiac arrest"" as opposed to ""restraint asphyxia"" or ""positional asphyxia.""";"https://doi.org/10.1177/0025802420988370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33629624/";25/02/2021;cardiac output;0.9902
42;Beyond Architectural Barriers: Building a Bridge Between Disability and Universal Design;10.1007/978-3-030-58820-5_51;"The paper is focused on the evolution of the concept of accessibility, by considering data of the World Health Organization (WHO) and of the Istat (Italian statistical institute). From these data it emerges that the population (worldwide and in Italy) dealing with disability represents an important share of the total. These disabilities are linked not only with disease, but also with other situation due to age, size, language, culture, job, etc. For this reason, this paper analyses how the way of seeing and dealing disability is changed over time, starting from the Italian Standard evolution. Then the action of the WHO is analyzed. The two WHO focus points are: i) disability is a health condition in an unfavorable environment; ii) disability is not a problem of a minority group within a community, but an experience that everyone, in their lifetime, can experience. All of these analyses underlined the importance of the environment influence on life of every person. Finally, the concept of Universal design UD is investigated, highlighting the importance of recognizing and understanding that human beings will have different steps in their abilities throughout their life. The originality of this research is the shifting of the attention also to people normally served by poor services, such as people of small stature, the elderly, pregnant women, parents with children in strollers, people who speak different languages and more.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974213/;26/08/2020;Universal design;0.9312
43;The evolving use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.;10.12968/jowc.2021.30.sup2.s8;The Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in significant and unprecedented shifts in the delivery of health care services in the United States. Although wound care remains an essential service during the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial consequences and infectious disease ramifications of the pandemic have resulted in closure or limitation of hours in many outpatient wound and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) centers. As HBOT patients often require daily treatment sessions for a period of months, it is necessary for facilities providing HBOT services to adjust to the COVID-19 pandemic while still maintaining availability of this important service. Modification of HBOT session timing and chamber decontamination procedures, utilisation of telehealth services for initial patient evaluations, and acceptance of novel patient populations and diagnoses are mechanisms by which HBOT centers can adapt to the evolving model of health care delivery throughout a pandemic. While COVID-19 is not a currently accepted indication for HBOT, patients may be referred for HBOT consultation due to the post-infectious sequelae of the virus, and thus HBOT facilities must be aware of the potential uses of this treatment for post-viral complications. By redefining paradigms for health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, HBOT and wound centers can continue to provide high-quality and uninterrupted care to vulnerable patient populations.;"https://doi.org/10.12968/jowc.2021.30.sup2.s8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33573494/";01/02/2021;Sars-CoV-2;0.9825
44;Participation in a Science Festival Promotes Inclusive Science Communication around Autism Spectrum Disorder;10.1101/2021.01.04.425324;As a high prevalence disorder with limited information about etiology, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been marked by confusion and miscommunication around its causes and treatments. To promote high-quality science communication, we participated in a local science festival, both providing information about the brain and ASD and asking passersby questions about their knowledge of ASD. We then asked the booth staffers to evaluate the program and conducted qualitative analyses of public and staffer responses. Public responses to the question “what would you like to know about autism?” most often concerned how the disorder was diagnosed or defined. In contrast, public responses to the question “what would you like others to know about autism?” centered around educating those unaffected by ASD on how to improve interactions and awareness, mentioning inclusivity and intersectionality, and dispelling negative stereotypes. The staffers overwhelmingly reported that in future years, they would include even more science and allow for more in-depth conversations with interested parties, as well as bringing materials in other languages. These responses are in keeping with a trend for more inclusive science communication, particularly in the field of behavioral health and ASD, and a desire to challenge myths around the condition. We conclude that our science festival interactions brought multiple benefits to public and staff.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.425324;05/01/2021;autism spectrum disorder;0.9764
45;How Are We Monitoring Brain Injuries in Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Device? A Systematic Review of Literature.;10.1097/mat.0000000000001204;Despite the common occurrence of brain injury in patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD), optimal neuromonitoring methods are unknown. A systematic review of PubMed and six electronic databases from inception was conducted until June 5, 2019. Studies reporting methods of neuromonitoring while on LVAD were extracted. Of 5,190 records screened, 37 studies met the inclusion criteria. The neuromonitoring methods include Transcranial Doppler ultrasound for emboli monitoring (TCD-e) (n = 13) and cerebral autoregulation (n = 3), computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (n = 9), serum biomarkers (n = 7), carotid ultrasound (n = 3), and near-infrared spectroscopy (n = 2). Of 421 patients with TCD-e, thromboembolic events (TEs) were reported in 79 patients (20%) and microembolic signals (MES) were detected in 105 patients (27%). Ischemic stroke was more prevalent in patients with MES compared to patients without MES (43% vs.13%, p < 0.001). Carotid ultrasound for assessing carotid stenosis was unreliable after LVAD implantation. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were associated with TEs. Significant heterogeneity exists in timing, frequency, and types of neuromonitoring tools. TCD-e and serial LDH levels appeared to have potential for assessing the risk of ischemic stroke. Future prospective research incorporating protocolized TCD-e and LDH may assist in monitoring adverse events in patients with LVAD.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512913/";01/02/2021;left ventricular assist device;0.9857
46;Impact of blood analysis and immune function on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19;10.1101/2020.04.16.20067587;Introduction: This retrospective study investigated the implications of changes in blood parameters and cellular immune function in patients with 2019-coronavirus infected disease (COVID-19). Methods: Records were reviewed of 85 patients with COVID-19 between February 4 and 16, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality at 28 days. Results: Fourteen patients died. The baseline leukocyte count, neutrophil count and hemoglobin was significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors, while the reverse was true of lymphocyte count, platelet, PaO2/FiO2, CD3+ count and CD4+ count. The percentage of neutrophil count > 6.3*109/L in death group was significantly higher than that in survival group, and multivariate logistic regression showed neutrophil count was independently associated with mortality. However, there were not significant difference in IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4 and the percentage of IgE > 100 IU/ml between the death group and survival group. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the following at baseline could significantly predict mortality: leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts. Conclusions: For patients with COVID-19, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts that marked decrease suggest a poor outcome. A high neutrophil count is independently associated with mortality. At admission, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts should receive added attention.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067587;22/04/2020;2019-coronavirus infected disease;0.9468
47;Europe’s War against COVID-19: A Map of Countries’ Disease Vulnerability Using Mortality Indicators;10.3390/ijerph17186565;Specific and older age-associated comorbidities increase mortality risk in severe forms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We matched COVID-19 comorbidities with causes of death in 28 EU countries for the total population and for the population above 65 years and applied a machine-learning-based tree clustering algorithm on shares of death for COVID-19 comorbidities and for influenza and on their growth rates between 2011 and 2016. We distributed EU countries in clusters and drew a map of the EU populations’ vulnerabilities to COVID-19 comorbidities and to influenza. Noncommunicable diseases had impressive shares of death in the EU but with substantial differences between eastern and western countries. The tree clustering algorithm accurately indicated the presence of western and eastern country clusters, with significantly different patterns of disease shares of death and growth rates. Western populations displayed higher vulnerability to malignancy, blood-related diseases, and diabetes mellitus and lower respiratory diseases, while eastern countries’ populations suffered more from ischaemic heart, cerebrovascular, and circulatory diseases. Dissimilarities between EU countries were also present when influenza was considered. The heat maps of EU populations’ vulnerability to diseases based on mortality indicators constitute the basis for more targeted health policy strategies in a collaborative effort at the EU level.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916973/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186565";09/09/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9797
48;The Impact of COVID-19 on Pre-Veterinary Opportunities and Recommendations for DVM Admissions.;10.3138/jvme-2020-0145;During the summer of 2020, a survey-based study was conducted at North Carolina State University, a land-grant university, to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on pre-veterinary students' ability to gain experience hours for Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) admissions. Of the 286 respondents (47% of the respondent pool), 92% reported losing at least one animal, veterinary, research, extracurricular, or work opportunity due to COVID-19, and 59% were not able to find a replacement. Of the lost experiences, 74 (20.8%) were for academic credit, resulting in 131 total academic credit hours lost, while only 12 credit hours were gained via alternative experiences. Of respondents, 30% (29.7%) identified as applicants of the 2020-2021 Veterinary Medical College Application Service (VMCAS) cycle. More than half (52.6%) of the sample identified being concerned about the strength of their VMCAS experiences due to these lost opportunities. Many respondents reported considering delaying application submissions by taking a gap year (17.5%) or have had their intended graduation timeline affected (14.8%). Since the majority of veterinary colleges utilize a holistic review process, this study provides a basis for understanding the effects of COVID-19 on the duration, depth, and diversity of experiences gained by future DVM applicants.

49;Correlations Between COVID-19 Cases and Google Trends Data in the United States: A State by State Analysis;10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.08.022;ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Since January 2020, Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases have risen exponentially in the United States. Accurate data on COVID-19 cases has been difficult to report due to lack of testing as well as the overload of the U.S. healthcare system. This study aims to evaluate whether a digital surveillance model using Google Trends is feasible, and whether accurate predictions can be made regarding new cases. METHODS Data on total and daily new cases in each U.S. state was collected and used in this study from late January to early April. Information regarding ten keywords was collected and correlation analyses were performed for individual states as well as for the United States overall. RESULTS Ten keywords were analyzed from Google Trends. “Face mask”, “Lysol”, and “COVID stimulus check” had the strongest correlations when looking at the United States as a whole, with R values of 0.88, 0.82 and 0.79 respectively. Lag and lead Pearson correlations were assessed for every state and all ten keywords from 16 days before the first case in each state to 16 days after the first case. Strong correlations were seen up to 16 days prior to the first reported cases in some states. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the feasibility of syndromic surveillance of internet search terms to monitor new infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This information could enable better preparation and planning of healthcare systems.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33164756/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619620309344?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619620309344; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.08.022";20/08/2020;Coronavirus;0.9339
50;The spectrum of neuropathology in COVID-19.;10.1111/nan.12667;There is increasing evidence that patients with Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) present with neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Anosmia, hypogeusia, headache, nausea and altered consciousness are commonly described, although there are emerging clinical reports of more serious and specific conditions such as acute cerebrovascular accident, encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Whether these presentations are directly due to viral invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) or caused by indirect mechanisms has yet to be established. Neuropathological examination of brain tissue at autopsy will be essential to establish the neuro-invasive potential of the SARS-CoV-2 virus but, to date, there have been few detailed studies. The pathological changes in the brain probably represent a combination of direct cytopathic effects mediated by SARS-CoV-2 replication or indirect effects due to respiratory failure, injurious cytokine reaction, reduced immune response and cerebrovascular accidents induced by viral infection. Further large-scale molecular and cellular investigations are warranted to clarify the neuropathological correlates of the neurological and psychiatric features seen clinically in COVID-19. In this review, we summarise the current reports of neuropathological examination in COVID-19 patients, in addition to our own experience, and discuss their contribution to the understanding of CNS involvement in this disease.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/nan.12667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935873/";16/09/2020;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9304

How can lessons learnt during the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa help to mitigate the likelihood of a long‐term devastating effect of the coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) outbreak on the African continent? Despite COVID‐19 spreading quickly across the globe after being first reported in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019, African countries remained relatively unaffected until the second week of March 2020. The majority of Africa countries have been at low to moderate risk. However, they have experienced many sociocultural, economic, political, and structural challenges. These have included laboratory capacity and logistical challenges; ill‐equipped public health systems; land border permeability, and delayed preparedness to transnational threats; and abject economic deprivation, lack of basic infrastructure, and associated sociocultural implications. There needs to be a strong country‐level leadership to coordinate and own all aspects of the responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic in a collaborative, transparent, and accountable way.

52;Association of substance use disorders and drug overdose with adverse COVID-19 outcomes in New York City: January–October 2020;10.1093/pubmed/fdaa241;BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that individuals with history of substance use disorder (SUD) are at increased risk of COVID-19, but little is known about relationships between SUDs, overdose and COVID-19 severity and mortality. This study investigated risks of severe COVID-19 among patients with SUDs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of data from a hospital system in New York City. Patient records from 1 January to 26 October 2020 were included. We assessed positive COVID-19 tests, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and death. Descriptive statistics and bivariable analyses compared the prevalence of COVID-19 by baseline characteristics. Logistic regression estimated unadjusted and sex-, age-, race- and comorbidity-adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for associations between SUD history, overdose history and outcomes. RESULTS: Of patients tested for COVID-19 (n = 188 653), 2.7% (n = 5107) had any history of SUD. Associations with hospitalization [AORs (95% confidence interval)] ranged from 1.78 (0.85–3.74) for cocaine use disorder (COUD) to 6.68 (4.33–10.33) for alcohol use disorder. Associations with ICU admission ranged from 0.57 (0.17–1.93) for COUD to 5.00 (3.02–8.30) for overdose. Associations with death ranged from 0.64 (0.14–2.84) for COUD to 3.03 (1.70–5.43) for overdose.

53;The relationship between cannabis use and patient outcomes in medication-based treatment of opioid use disorder: A systematic review.;10.1016/j.cpr.2020.101939;Despite high rates of cannabis use during medication-based treatment of opioid use disorder (MOUD), uncertainty remains around how cannabis influences treatment outcomes. We sought to investigate the relationship between cannabis use during MOUD and a number of patient outcomes. We searched seven databases for original peer-reviewed studies documenting the relationship between cannabis use and at least one primary outcome (opioid use, treatment adherence, or treatment retention) among patients enrolled in methadone-, buprenorphine-, or naltrexone-based therapy for OUD. In total, 41 articles (including 23 methadone, 7 buprenorphine, 6 naltrexone, and 5 mixed modalities) were included in this review. For each primary outcome area, there was a small number of studies that produced findings suggestive of a supportive or detrimental role of concurrent cannabis use, but the majority of studies reported that cannabis use was not statistically significantly associated with the outcome. No studies of naltrexone treatment demonstrated significantly worse outcomes for cannabis users. We identified methodological shortcomings and future research priorities, including exploring the potential role of adjunct cannabis use for improving opioid craving and withdrawal during MOUD. While monitoring for cannabis use may help guide clinicians towards an improved treatment plan, cannabis use is unlikely to independently threaten treatment outcomes.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2020.101939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33130527/";24/10/2020;opioid use disorder;0.9901
54;BCG Vaccination Program mitigates COVID19 Related Mortality: A Reality check.;10.2174/1389201022666210202142811;Since its origin in the Wuhan province of China in December 2019, Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has spread to most parts of the world and has infected millions of people. However, the significant variability in the mortality rate across the world indicates some underlying factors, especially the immunity factors that may have a potential role in this variability. One such factor that is being discussed and tested is the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. The available evidence suggests that BCG vaccination provides broad protection against respiratory infections as well as other infections. Therefore, BCG may prove to be a barrier for COVID-19 infection and may offer a ray of hope. In this review, we contrasted BCG vaccination program with COVID-19 mortality and analyzed trained immunity and cross protection against unrelated pathogens due to BCG vaccination. On analyzing the available data, we observed that countries without universal BCG vaccination policy are severely affected, while countries having universal BCG policies are less affected. Based on these data, we propose that the SARS-CoV-2 related qualified immunity, cross protection against unrelated pathogens and COVID-19 impact variations could be partly explained by the different national policies regarding BCG childhood vaccination. The combination of reduced morbidity and mortality may make BCG vaccination a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.2174/1389201022666210202142811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33530904/";02/02/2021;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9753
55;Temporary hospitals in times of the COVID pandemic. An example and a practical view.;10.37201/req/041.2021;We describe the most widely used temporary hospital in Europe during the first pandemic wave, its structure, function, and achievements. Other models of care developed during the pandemic around the world were reviewed including their capacity, total bed/ICU bed ratio and time of use. We particularly analyzed the common and differential characteristics of this type of facilities. IFEMA Exhibition Center was transformed into a temporary 1,300-bed hospital, which was in continuous operation for 42 days. A total of 3,817 people were treated, generally patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, 91% of whom had pneumonia. The average length of stay was 5 to 36 days. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (16.5%), diabetes mellitus (9.1%), COPD (6%), asthma (4.6%), obesity (2.9%) and dementia (1.6%). A total of 113 patients (3%) were transferred to another centers for aggravation, 19 (0.5%) were admitted to ICU and 16 patients (0.4%) died. An element of great help to reducing the overload of care in large hospitals during peaks of health emergencies could be these flexible structures capable of absorbing the excess of patients. These must be safe, breaking domestic transmission and guarantee social and emotional needs of patients. The success of these structures depends on delimitation in admission criteria taking into account the proportion of patients who may require, during admission, assistance in the critical care area.;"https://doi.org/10.37201/req/041.2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33752321/";22/03/2021;mild to moderate;0.9079
56;Humidified Warmed CO(2) Treatment Therapy Strategies Can Save Lives With Mitigation and Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: An Evidence Review;10.3389/fmed.2020.594295;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has presented enormous challenges for healthcare, societal, and economic systems worldwide. There is an urgent global need for a universal vaccine to cover all SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains to stop the current COVID-19 pandemic and the threat of an inevitable second wave of coronavirus. Carbon dioxide is safe and superior antimicrobial, which suggests it should be effective against coronaviruses and mutants thereof. Depending on the therapeutic regime, CO(2) could also ameliorate other COVID-19 symptoms as it has also been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammation, anti-cytokine effects, and to stimulate the human immune system. Moreover, CO(2) has beneficial effects on respiratory physiology, cardiovascular health, and human nervous systems. This article reviews the rationale of early treatment by inhaling safe doses of warmed humidified CO(2) gas, either alone or as a carrier gas to deliver other inhaled drugs may help save lives by suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infections and excessive inflammatory responses. We suggest testing this somewhat counter-intuitive, but low tech and safe intervention for its suitability as a preventive measure and treatment against COVID-19. Overall, development and evaluation of this therapy now may provide a safe and economical tool for use not only during the current pandemic but also for any future outbreaks of respiratory diseases and related conditions.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425942/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.594295";11/12/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9357
57;COVID‐19 Pandemic: Consensus Guidelines for Preferred Practices in an Aesthetic Clinic;10.1111/dth.13597;BACKGROUND: Strict infection control measures in response to the current COVID‐19 pandemic are expected to remain for an extended period. In aesthetic clinics, most procedures are provided on one to one basis by the physician or therapist. In such a scenario, guidelines detailing the infection control measures for aesthetic clinics are of particular importance. METHODS: An online meeting of an international group of experts in the field of aesthetic medicine, with experience in administration of an aesthetic clinic, was convened. The meeting aimed to provide a set of consensus guidelines to protect clinic staff and patients from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. RESULTS: Consensus guidelines for ‘preferred practices' were provided for scheduling of patients, patient evaluation and triaging, and for safety precautions about the different procedures. Procedures were categorized into low‐risk, moderate risk, and high‐risk based on the likelihood of transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 virus from the patient to the treating physician or therapist. CONCLUSIONS: While not intended to be complete or exhaustive, these guidelines provide sound infection control measures for aesthetic practices. Since guidelines regarding safety measures and use of PPEs may vary from country to country, the local guidelines should also be followed to prevent COVID‐19 infection in aesthetic clinics.

Objective To characterize mucocutaneous disease and its relation to clinical course among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C. Methods Descriptive cohort study of prospectively and consecutively hospitalized eligible patients between May 11, 2020 and June 5, 2020. Results In COVID-19 patients, 4/12 (33%) had rash and/or mucositis, including erythema, morbilliform pattern, and lip mucositis. In MIS-C patients, 9/19 (47%) had rash and/or mucositis, including erythema, morbilliform, retiform purpura, targetoid and urticarial patterns, along with acral edema, lip mucositis, tongue papillitis, and conjunctivitis. COVID-19 patients with rash had less frequent respiratory symptoms, PICU admission, and invasive ventilation, as well as shorter stay (vs COVID-19 without rash). MIS-C patients with rash had less frequent PICU admission, shock, ventilation, as well as lower levels of CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, and troponin (vs MIS-C without rash). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was similar for patients with and without rash in both groups. None of the MIS-C patients met criteria for Kawasaki disease. Limitations Small sample sizes. Conclusions Mucocutaneous disease is common among children and adolescents with COVID-19 and MIS-C. Laboratory trends observed in patients with rash may prognosticate a less severe course.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962220328723?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323343/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0190962220328723; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.10.060";24/10/2020;shorter stay;0.9362
59;Treatment of Covid19 ‐ Repurposing drugs commonly used in dermatology;10.1111/dth.13829;For the last two decades, the outbreaks of diseases caused by coronaviruses and intermittent worldwide public health emergences have reminded us that they still represent a severe threat to global health. The recent outbreak of Corona Virus disease 19 (COVID‐19) highlighted the urgent need for effective treatment, and initiated rapid search for therapies, able to counter the most severe disease effects. Many aspects of COVID‐19 pathogenesis are unknown, but complex interplay of direct viral damage and immune response dysregulation is underline. Intensive research is undergoing for therapeutic targets of virus and high‐efficiency and low toxicity targeted drugs. There is no available specific antiviral treatment of this disease, therefore repurposing of drugs already available for the treatment of other viral and autoimmune diseases has been a part of research efforts. Well known anti‐inflammatory properties of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, agents widely used in dermatology, made them potential candidates for the treatment of COVID‐19. We review pathogenesis and clinical characteristic of COVID‐19, as well as treatment options that have been under evaluation in past several months. In addition, we focus more on Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, their pharmacological properties, clinical utility, and current recommendations for their use in COVID‐19.

60;Feeling Seen, Being Heard: Perspectives of Patients Suffering from Mental Illness on the Possibility of Physician-Assisted Death in the Netherlands;10.1007/s11013-021-09726-5;Physician-assisted death (PAD) for patients suffering from a mental illness is allowed in the Netherlands under certain conditions but is a very controversial topic, mainly discussed by ethicists and physicians. The voice of the patient is rarely included in the debate, so we know little about what their views on the topic are. We aim to understand the views of patients with mental illness and wish to die with regard to the possibility of PAD in the Netherlands. The data for this qualitative study were collected through 21 in-depth interviews with Dutch patients who have a wish for PAD as a result of suffering from a mental illness. We identified four themes in relation to the meaning of PAD for the patients suffering from mental illness and wish to die. These themes are (1) Autonomy and self-determination, (2) ending the suffering, (3) recognition, and (4) a dignified end-of-life. The option of PAD for patients suffering from mental illnesses was considered of great importance to the patients who have a wish to die. We highlight the importance of ‘recognition’ for the situation of the patient, as this could lead to new perspective. We argue that psychiatrists need to reflect on providing this recognition in earlier phases of treatment, taking seriously and discussing a wish for PAD in treatment is beneficial to patients. It provides space for the patient to discuss their wishes and could cause them not wanting to die anymore.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34132955/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11013-021-09726-5";16/06/2021;Physician-assisted death;0.9652

This study aimed to identify and externally validate PPC risk prediction models in an international, prospective cohort. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify risk prediction models for PPC following abdominal surgery. External validation was performed using data from a prospective dataset of adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery from January to April 2019 in the UK, Ireland and Australia. The primary outcome was identification of PPC within 30-days (StEP-COMPAC criteria definition). Model discrimination and diagnostic accuracy were compared. RESULTS: Six unique risk prediction models were eligible from 2819 records. These were validated across 11,591 patients, with an overall PPC rate of 7.8% (n = 903). The Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalonia (ARISCAT) score provided the best discrimination (AUC: 0.709 (95% CI: 0.692-0.727), yet no risk prediction model demonstrated good discrimination (AUC >0.7). CONCLUSION: The risk of PPC for patients following major abdominal surgery in the pre-covid era is not well described by existing prediction tools. New prediction tools are required to account for additional variation introduced for patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083486/;08/04/2021;Postoperative pulmonary complications;0.9096
62;[Smoking cessation - achievable and effective].;10.1055/a-1259-8353;In hospital, effective smoking cessation can be organized through counselling, pharmacological aids and, above all, continuous care in outpatient structures following discharge. Pharmacological treatment has proven to be effective and safe with nicotine replacement therapy as well as varenicline. Counselling plus pharmacotherapy is more effective in combination than either therapy is on its own. To better implement structures medical societies in Germany are seeking adequate funding e. g. in the DRG system for hospitalised patients.There are obvious and relevant benefits in smoking cessation. Not only for the main tobacco-related diseases such as coronary heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), positive effects of quitting on morbidity and mortality have been confirmed by high-quality meta-analyses. Furthermore, quality of life is increasing following cessation. Presently, smoking is found to be a significant risk factor for severe disease and mortality following coronavirus infection.Do e-cigarettes offer an alternative in smoking cessation? No. Animal and human data are suggesting toxic effects especially following longer use. The long-term effectiveness of e-cigarettes in tobacco cessation is still uncertain and epidemiologic data clearly point toward ineffectiveness. Furthermore, dual use with potentiation of the toxic effects is common. Therefore, e-cigarettes cannot be recommended for tobacco cessation.;"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1259-8353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062591/";01/06/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9696
63;Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor with high-grade features masquerading as tubercular meningitis—a case report;10.1186/s43055-021-00522-0;BACKGROUND: Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT) has been recently described in the literature. The complete neuroimaging spectrum and histopathological characteristics of this entity are yet to be elucidated. In an endemic region, diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement on neuroimaging with associated communicating hydrocephalus is usually suggestive of infective meningitis and the patients are started on empirical anti-microbial therapy. However, it is important to consider other differential diagnosis of leptomeningeal enhancement in such cases, particularly if the clinical condition does not improve on anti-microbial therapy. An early diagnosis of a neoplastic etiology may be of particular importance as the treatment regimens vary considerably depending on the underlying disease condition. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report, we describe a case of DLGNT with high-grade histopathological features which was initially managed as tubercular meningitis based on the initial neuroimaging findings. Due to worsening of the clinical course and subsequent imaging findings at follow-up, a diagnosis of DLGNT was considered and subsequently proven to be DLGNT with features of anaplasia on histopathological examination of leptomeningeal biopsy specimen. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of recognizing certain subtle finding on MRI which may help in an early diagnosis of DLGNT which is crucial for appropriate treatment.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8193168/;11/06/2021;Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor;0.9679
64;A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Technique for Internet of Medical Things Data;10.3390/s21113726;The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in the medical world is growing, with a range of purposes: from the identification and prediction of possible diseases to patient monitoring and clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical devices, under the umbrella of the “Internet of Medical Things” (IoMT), has simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently large to train machine learning models. In this work, we apply the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform a data augmentation from patient data obtained through IoMT sensors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) monitoring. We also apply an explainable AI algorithm to demonstrate the accuracy of the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data recorded by the sensors. The results obtained demonstrate how synthetic datasets created through a well-structured GAN are comparable with a real dataset, as validated by a novel approach based on machine learning.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071944/";27/05/2021;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;0.9195
65;Sanal Flow Choking: A Paradigm Shift in Computational Fluid Dynamics Code Verification and Diagnosing Detonation and Hemorrhage in Real‐World Fluid‐Flow Systems;10.1002/gch2.202000012;The discovery of Sanal flow choking is a scientific breakthrough and a paradigm shift in the diagnostics of the detonation/hemorrhage in real‐world fluid flow systems. The closed‐form analytical models capable of predicting the boundary‐layer blockage factor for both 2D and 3D cases at the Sanal flow choking for adiabatic and diabatic fluid flow conditions are critically reviewed here. The beauty and novelty of these models stem from the veracity that at the Sanal flow choking condition for diabatic flows all the conservation laws of nature are satisfied at a unique location, which allows for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code verification. At the Sanal flow choking condition both the thermal choking and the wall‐friction‐induced flow choking occur at a single sonic fluid throat location. The blockage factor predicted at the Sanal flow choking condition can be taken as an infallible data for various in silico model verification, validation, and calibration. The 3D blockage factor at the Sanal flow choking is found to be 45.12% lower than the 2D case of a wall‐bounded diabatic fluid flow system with air as the working fluid. The physical insight of Sanal flow choking presented in this review article sheds light on finding solutions, through in silico experiments in base flow and nanoflows, for numerous unresolved problems carried forward over the centuries in physical, chemical, and biological sciences for humankind.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837737/; https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202000012";27/05/2020;computational fluid dynamics;0.916

The adverse neurobiological impact of pain and stress in the preterm infant has been well documented, including neuroimaging and neurobehavioral outcomes. Although many tools have been validated to assess acute pain, few methods are available to assess chronic pain or agitation (a clinical manifestation of neonatal stress). Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches are used to reduce the negative impact of pain and agitation in the preterm infant, with concerns emerging over the adverse effects of analgesia and sedatives. Considering benefits and risks of available treatments, units must develop a stepwise algorithm to prevent, assess, and treat pain. Nonpharmacologic interventions should be consistently utilized prior to mild to moderately painful procedures. Sucrose may be utilized judiciously as an adjunctive therapy for minor painful procedures. Rapidly acting opioids (fentanyl or remifentanil) form the backbone of analgesia for moderately painful procedures. Chronic sedation during invasive mechanical ventilation represents an ongoing challenge; appropriate containment and an optimal environment should be standard; when indicated, low-dose morphine infusion may be utilized cautiously and dexmedetomidine infusion may be considered as an emerging adjunct.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223850/;02/01/2020;neonatal intensive care unit;0.9034

As of April 24th, mortality from COVID-19 has reached almost 200,000 people, with the United States (US) leading the globe in levels of morbidity and mortality. Large volumes of high acuity patients, particularly those of advanced age and with chronic co-morbidities, have significantly increased the need for palliative care resources beyond usual capacity. More specifically, COVID-19 has changed the way we approach patient and family member interactions. Concern for nosocomial spread of this infection has resulted in strict visitation restrictions that have left many patients to face this illness, make difficult decisions, and even die, alone in the hospital. In order to meet the needs of COVID patients, services such as Emergency Medicine and Palliative Care have responded rapidly by adopting novel ways of practicing medicine. We describe the use of telepalliative medicine (TM) implemented in an Emergency Department (ED) setting to allow family members the ability to interact with their loved ones during critical illness, and even during end of life. Use of this technology has helped facilitate goals of care discussions, in addition to providing contact and closure for both patients and their loved ones. We describe our rapid and ongoing implementation of TM consultation for our ED patients and discuss lessons learned and recommendations for others considering similar care models.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0736467920308507; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.08.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736467920308507?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962902/";04/08/2020;Abstract Coronavirus-2;0.9739

The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to widespread concerns about the risk of infection in patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) receiving disease modifying ant-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and other immunosuppressants (IS). Methods. A SurveyMonkey based electronic survey was conducted amongst members of the Indian Rheumatology Association to understand the need for changes in prevailing practices. Results. Of the 861 invitees, 221 responded. In the wake of the pandemic, 47.5% would reduce biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) while only 12.2% would reduce the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs. 64.2% were likely to defer change in IS, the reluctance being most with rituximab (58.3%) followed by cyclophosphamide (53.3%), anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents (52.4%) and Janus kinase inhibitors (34.39%). Hydroxychloroquine was the preferred choice (81.9%) for the treatment of COVID-19 followed by protease inhibitors (22.1%) and intravenous immunoglobulin (8.1%). Chloroquine was less preferred (19%). More than two-thirds (70.5%) believed that COVID-19 might trigger macrophage activation syndrome.

With the rapidly virus spreading around the globe, the shortage of ventilators becomes a global challenge and numerus efforts are followed. While industry mobilizes toward producing medical grade equipment, a number of low‐cost and less complex emergency ventilators have been developed, mainly through academic and open‐source channels, with a hope to meet any temporary needs gap until medical grade ventilator provision becomes sufficient. Herein, the design and implementation of one such emergency ventilator called GlasVent is presented, which an automated version of manual resuscitator device, commonly known as big valve mask or artificial manual breathing unit bag and widely used prior to initiating the mechanical ventilation. GlasVent uses 3D printed mechanical parts, widely available materials and off‐the‐shelf electronic and sensing devices which can be fast assembled. Furthermore, it requires minimal training and can be operated manually by hands or legs, thus meeting the emergency requirements even in the low‐resource settings or regions with less developed healthcare systems.

70;Descending Flight Simulation of Tiltrotor Aircraft at Different Descent Rates;10.1007/978-3-030-50436-6_13;Helicopters and tiltrotor aircrafts are known to fall into an unstable state called vortex ring state when they descend rapidly. This paper presents a six degrees of freedom descending flight simulation of a tiltrotor aircraft represented by the V-22 Osprey, considering the interaction between fluid and a rigid body. That is, an aircraft affects the surrounding flow field by rotating the rotors, and flies with the generated force as thrust. Similarly, an orientation of the airframe is controlled by aerodynamic force which is generated by manipulating the shape. This numerical analysis is a complicated moving boundary problem involving motion of an air-frame or rotation of rotors. As a numerical approach, the Moving Computational Domain (MCD) method in combination with the multi-axis sliding mesh approach is adopted. In the MCD method, the whole computational domain moves with objects in the domain. At this time, fluid flow around the objects is generated by the movement of the boundaries. In addition, this method removes computational space restrictions, allowing an aircraft to move freely within the computational space regardless of a size of a computational grid. The multi-axis sliding mesh approach allows rotating bodies to be placed in a computational grid. Using the above approach, the flight simulation at two different descent rates is performed to reveal a behavior of a tiltrotor aircraft and a state of the surrounding flow field.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304758/;25/05/2020;Moving Computational Domain;0.9595
71;The Technique and Justification for Minimally Invasive Surgery in COVID-19 Pandemic: Laparoscopic Anterior Resection for Near Obstructed Rectal Carcinoma.;10.1089/lap.2020.0241;Introduction: The recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has made surgeons change and take on newer strategies and safe exercises. All elective cases have been put off, but oncology cases need to be done to prevent progression of the disease. There is concern about minimally invasive surgery due to aerosol formation. Here we discuss how we have dealt with this in our colorectal surgery department taking into account current evidence about the danger of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery. Discussion: We report a case of 28 years old female patient with carcinoma rectum. The patient had near total intestinal obstruction. She was operated on utilizing laparoscopic anterior resection. The air seal (CONMED, Utica, NY) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was utilized for safe gas evacuation. There is no evidence against laparoscopic surgery, which suggest viral transmission. One should take utmost precautions using N95 masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Air filtration products like aerosol, HEPA filters will be of great aid in safe evacuation of gases. Conclusion: At present, there is no solid evidence to suggest viral transmission through surgical smoke. We believe due to effective smoke containment, less blood loss, and less postoperative stay, laparoscopy will be a non-inferior option than open surgical procedure. We advise taking all precautions for operating room staff to lessen the danger of transmission.;"https://doi.org/10.1089/lap.2020.0241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315244/";20/04/2020;air seal;0.9056
72;Intrapulmonary distal airway stem cell transplantation repairs lung injury in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;10.1111/cpr.13046;OBJECTIVES: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by irreversible lung tissue damage including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, which could further develop into respiratory failure. Many studies have revealed a potential regenerative function of the distal airway stem/progenitor cells (DASCs) after lung injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse and human DASCs were expanded, analysed, and engrafted into injured mouse lungs. Single‐cell analyses were performed to reveal the differentiation path of the engrafted cells. Finally, human DASCs were transplanted into COPD mice induced by porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. RESULTS: We showed that isolated mouse and human DASCs could be indefinitely expanded and were able to further differentiate into mature alveolar structures in vitro. Single‐cell analysis indicated that the engrafted cells expressed typical cellular markers of type I alveolar cells as well as the specific secreted proteins. Interestingly, transplantation of human DASCs derived from COPD patients into the lungs of NOD‐SCID mice with COPD injury repaired the tissue damage and improved the pulmonary function. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated that functional lung structure could be reconstituted by intrapulmonary transplantation of DASCs, suggesting a potential therapeutic role of DASCs transplantation in treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960563/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13046";07/05/2021;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9863

Persistent olfactory dysfunction appears to be commonplace and will drive the demand for General Practitioner, Otolaryngology or Neurology consultation in the next months ‐ evidence regarding recovery will be essential in counselling our patients. METHODS: prospective survey‐based data collection and telemedicine follow‐up. RESULTS: 751 patients completed the study. The mean age of patients was 41 ± 13 (range: 18 – 60). There were 477 females and 274 males. There were 621 patients (83%) who subjectively report a total loss of smell and 130 (17%) a partial loss. After a mean follow‐up of 47±7 days (range: 30–71) from the first consultation, 277 (37%) of patients still reported a persistent subjective loss of smell, 107 (14%) reported partial recovery and 367 (49%) reported complete recovery. The mean duration of the OD was 10±6 days (range: 3–31) in those patients who completely recovered and 12±8 days (range: 7–35) in those patients who partially recovered. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, at this relatively early point in the pandemic, subjective patterns of recovery of olfactory disfunction in COVID‐19 patients are valuable for our patients, hypothesis generation and treatment development.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32677329/";16/07/2020;Post‐viral olfactory dysfunction;0.958
74;SARS-CoV-2 infects brain choroid plexus and disrupts the blood-CSF-barrier;10.1101/2020.08.20.259937;Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leads primarily to respiratory symptoms that can be fatal, particularly in at risk individuals. However, neurological symptoms have also been observed in patients, including headache, seizures, stroke, and fatigue. The cause of these complications is not yet known, and whether they are due to a direct infection of neural cells, such as neurons and astrocytes, or through indirect effects on supportive brain cells, is unknown. Here, we use brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We examine expression of the key viral receptor ACE2 in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealing that only a subset of choroid plexus cells but not neurons or neural progenitors express this entry factor. We then challenge organoids with both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate high viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but not stromal cells, and little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells of the choroid plexus are an apolipoprotein and ACE2 expressing subset of epithelial barrier cells. Finally, we show that infection with live SARS-CoV-2 leads to barrier breakdown of the choroid plexus. These findings suggest that neurological complications may result from effects on the choroid plexus, an important barrier that normally prevents entry of immune cells and cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.20.259937;21/08/2020;Coronavirus disease-19;0.9827
75;New Evidence of Potential Benefits of Dexamethasone and Added on Therapy of Fludrocortisone on Clinical Outcomes of Corticosteroid in Sepsis Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis;10.3390/jpm11060544;The aim of this study is to investigate clinical outcomes of corticosteroid treatment in patients with sepsis or septic shock. An electronic keyword searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were conducted per PRISMA guidelines. The pooled analyses on the corticosteroid impact on mortality, adverse events, and clinical outcomes were performed. Subgroup analyses on the clinical outcomes in relation to corticosteroid dose, duration, and agents were performed. Pooled analyses of 21 randomized control trials revealed substantially reduced mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88–0.99, p = 0.02) and length of stay in intensive care unit (SMD −1.66, 95% CI −1.91–−1.40, p < 0.00001) without increased risks of adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96–1.12, p = 0.38). No significant improvements of other clinical outcomes were observed. Subgroup analyses demonstrated substantially reduced mortality with short-term (≤7 days) low-dose (<400 mg/day) corticosteroid treatment (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87–0.95, p < 0.0001). Moreover, dexamethasone (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20–0.81, p = 0.01) and combined hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone treatment (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.84–0.94, p < 0.00001) provided substantial reduction of mortality whereas hydrocortisone alone did not reduce the mortality risk in sepsis patients. Thus, further controlled studies on the clinical outcomes of potential corticosteroid options on sepsis-related clinical outcomes are warranted.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208300/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11060544";11/06/2021;steroid treatment;0.9596
76;The impact of COVID‐19 pandemic on hospitality stock returns in China;10.1002/ijfe.2508;Coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) has already devastated the world, and the economy becomes the most critical challenge for any country worldwide. The increasing uncertainty of the COVID‐19 outbreak has made stock markets in China more turbulent and less predictable. Under the current exceptional circumstances, the hospitality industry suffered the most due to the travel restrictions. This research thus assesses the dynamic relationship among the COVID‐19 outbreak, macroeconomic fluctuations and hospitality stock returns based on a structural VAR framework from 13 January to 11 May 2020, in China. Evidence reveals that macroeconomic fluctuations and hospitality stock returns are significantly affected by shocks from the COVID‐19 outbreak. An unanticipated positive change of the COVID‐19 explosion triggers an addition in exchange rates and causes a reduction in the stock market and hospitality industry returns. For the impacts of the exchange rate, findings reveal that a surprise increase in exchange rates (currency depreciation) exerts a significant negative influence on stock market returns. Additionally, a positive change of stock market returns is linked to a decline in exchange rates and a rise in hospitality industry returns. Therefore, knowledge of these relationships can enable policymakers to evaluate and implement effective policies to stabilize the stock markets and help investors to make appropriate investment strategies.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8013846/;01/02/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9312

Methods: We optimize a set of simple finite impulse response (FIR) models comprising of a scaling factor and time-delay between officially reported cases, ICU admissions and deaths time series using the least squares method. Combined with randomized PCR study results, we utilize this simple model to estimate the total number of infections in Sweden, and the corresponding IFR. Results: The model class provides a good fit between ICU admissions and deaths throughout 2020. Cases fit consistently from July 2020, by when PCR tests had become broadly available. We observe a diminished IFR in late summer as well as a strong decline during 2021, following the launch of a nation-wide vaccination program. The total number of infections during 2020 is estimated to $1.3$ million. Conclusions: A FIR model with a delta filter function describes the evolution of epidemiological data in Sweden well. The fact that we found IFR, ICR and IIAR constant over large parts of 2020 is in contrast with claims of healthcare adaptation or mutated virus variants importantly affecting these ratios. The model allows us to retrospectively estimate the COVID-19 epidemiological trajectory, and conclude that Sweden was far from herd immunity by the end of 2020.";"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.27.21257900; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.27.21257900v1?rss=1";31/05/2021;infection-to-fatality ratio;0.907
78;How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms?;10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102410;The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused substantial public health burden and widespread anxiety. The adverse mental health effects caused by COVID-19 may be particularly acute for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). For the present study, we developed an online survey to investigate how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions to assess multiple facets of how the pandemic has affected individuals with OCD symptoms. Responses were collected from adults with self-identified OCD recruited from OCD-specific forums and websites (n = 252). The majority (76.2 %) of respondents reported that their OCD symptoms had worsened since the outbreak, though there was substantial variability in individual responses. Negative effects of COVID-19 were more strongly linked to contamination and responsibility for harm symptoms than for other symptom dimensions. The self-identified OCD group also reported heightened concerns about COVID-19 compared to a community control sample recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Lastly, many participants reported that the pandemic had interfered with their OCD treatment, yet they remained mostly satisfied with how their treatment providers had handled the crisis. These results highlight the importance of considering how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community, with possible implications for treatment providers.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965747/";30/04/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9673
79;Prevention and practice during the COVID-19 emergency declaration period in Japanese obstetrical/gynecological facilities.;10.1111/jog.14432;AIM A nationwide questionnaire survey was performed to evaluate how Japanese Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG) members dealt with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic during the declared nationwide emergency. METHODS We sent questionnaires to members of JSOG via official email. Participants answered anonymously using Google forms. RESULTS Two (0.08%) JSOG members had contracted COVID-19. There was a clear decrease in the number of patients scheduled for operation, not only for malignant but also for benign diseases. A decrease in the number of outpatients for infertility treatment was also observed. Polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was available in 20.4% of the facilities. Inpatients and outpatients were requested to wear masks, limit the number of contacts and check body temperature when visiting hospitals/clinics. During parturition care, caregivers and physicians wore gloves, masks (other than N-95), face shields and gowns. About 66% and 80% of the facilities decided to transfer pregnant women if they had asymptomatic and symptomatic infection, respectively. Cesarean section was typically chosen as delivery mode in infected women. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic provoked significant changes in obstetrics and gynecology practices in Japan. Apparently, nosocomial infections were largely prevented due to these changes, although some of them might not have been necessary.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.14432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32909322/";09/09/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9499
80;A county-level study of the effects of state-mandated COVID-19 lockdowns on urban and rural restaurant visits using consumers’ cell phone geo-location data;10.1007/s10389-020-01473-y;AIM: US federal, state, and local governments implemented numerous COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders (lockdowns) starting in March 2020 to ensure social distancing regulations and help stop the spread of COVID-19. It is important to know how these lockdowns affected businesses, such as restaurants, in regions that vary in terms of poverty status and geography. In this paper, we analyze the differential changes in rural and urban restaurant visits by the restaurants’ NAICS codes following the COVID-19 lockdowns. Our analysis contributes to the public policy literature and helps operational planning for food distribution during a pandemic. METHODS: Since urban and rural consumer behavior and food resources are significantly different, it is crucial to conduct a comparative analysis. Our study applies a difference-in-differences model to capture the differential effects lockdowns have on urban and rural restaurants. RESULTS: We find that restaurant visits declined significantly in both rural and urban counties after shelter-at-home orders. The decrease in total restaurant visits was almost twice as high in urban counties as in rural counties. We also find that visits to fast-food restaurants increased in rural counties during shelter-at-home orders. CONCLUSIONS: These results contribute to previous studies on the dearth of healthy food in rural and poorer regions, and inform important public policy response in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-020-01473-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469476/";15/01/2021;shelter-in-place orders;0.9772
81;Recent Advances in Molecular Docking for the Research and Discovery of Potential Marine Drugs;10.3390/md18110545;Marine drugs have long been used and exhibit unique advantages in clinical practices. Among the marine drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the protein–ligand interactions, such as cytarabine–DNA polymerase, vidarabine–adenylyl cyclase, and eribulin–tubulin complexes, are the important mechanisms of action for their efficacy. However, the complex and multi-targeted components in marine medicinal resources, their bio-active chemical basis, and mechanisms of action have posed huge challenges in the discovery and development of marine drugs so far, which need to be systematically investigated in-depth. Molecular docking could effectively predict the binding mode and binding energy of the protein–ligand complexes and has become a major method of computer-aided drug design (CADD), hence this powerful tool has been widely used in many aspects of the research on marine drugs. This review introduces the basic principles and software of the molecular docking and further summarizes the applications of this method in marine drug discovery and design, including the early virtual screening in the drug discovery stage, drug target discovery, potential mechanisms of action, and the prediction of drug metabolism. In addition, this review would also discuss and prospect the problems of molecular docking, in order to provide more theoretical basis for clinical practices and new marine drug research and development.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33143025/; https://doi.org/10.3390/md18110545";30/10/2020;computer-aided drug design;0.9813

In this study, we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes, and to explore potential causal effects. We used logistic regression to identify associations between different vitamin D variables (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25-OHD), ambient UVB and genetically-predicted 25-OHD concentrations) and COVID-19 (risk of infection, hospitalisation and death) in 495,780 participants from UK Biobank. We subsequently performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to test if there was any causal effect. In total, 1,746 COVID-19 cases and 399 COVID-19 deaths occurred between March and June 2020. We found significant inverse associations between COVID-19 infection and 25-OHD in univariable models, but these associations were non-significant after adjustment for confounders. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with hospitalization and death. Although the main MR analysis showed that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels were not causally associated with COVID-19 risk, MR sensitivity analysis using weighted mode method indicated a potential causal effect (OR=0.72, 95% CI:0.53-0.98; P=0.041).

83;Exposure to particulate matter upregulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the murine lung();10.1016/j.envres.2021.110722;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is currently a serious global issue. Epidemiological studies have identified air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection and severity of illness, in addition to numerous factors such as pre-existing conditions, aging and smoking. However, the mechanisms by which air pollution is involved in the manifestation and/or progression of COVID-19 is still unknown. In this study, we used a mouse model exposed to crude PM, collected by the cyclone method, to evaluate the pulmonary expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), the two molecules required for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells. Multiplex immunohistochemical analysis revealed that exposure to PM increased the expression of these two molecules at the same site. Furthermore, image cytometry analysis revealed increased expression of these proteins, particularly, in the alveolar type 2 cells and macrophages, which are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide an experimental evidence that exposure to PM may adversely affect the manifestation and progression of COVID-19, mediated by the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the site of entry. The study results suggest that examining these effects might help to advance our understanding of COVID-19 and aid the development of appropriate social interventions.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110722; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121000165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33422505/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121000165?v=s5";07/01/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.986
84;Discovery of Novel Coumarin Analogs against the α-Glucosidase Protein Target of Diabetes Mellitus: Pharmacophore-Based QSAR, Docking, and Molecular Dynamics Simulation Studies;10.1021/acsomega.0c03871;[Image: see text] Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease, the third killer of mankind. The finding of potent drugs against diabetes remains challenging. In the present study, coumarin derivatives with known biological activity against diabetic protein have been used to predict functional groups’ positions on coumarin derivatives. α-Glucosidase is a brush border membrane-bound lysosomal enzyme from the hydrolase enzyme family. It plays an important role in the metabolism of glycoproteins. Inhibitors of lysosomal α-glucosidase can reduce postprandial hyperglycemia. Due to this, lysosomal α-glucosidase is a good therapeutic target for drugs. A total of 116 coumarin derivatives with IC50 values against lysosomal α-glucosidase were selected for a CADD (computer-aided drug design) approach to identify more potent drugs. Pharmacophore modeling and atom-based 3-QSAR of 116 active compounds against lysosomal α-glucosidase were performed and identified positions and types of groups to increase activity. We performed molecular docking of 116 coumarin derivatives against the lysosomal α-glucosidase enzyme, and three compounds (isorutarine, 10_, and 36) resulted in a docking score of −7.64, −7.12, and −6.86 kcal/mol. The molecular dynamics simulation of the above three molecules and protein complex performed for 100 ns supported the interaction stability of isorutarine, 10_, and 36 with the lysosomal binding site α-glucosidase.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7758891/;10/12/2020;computer-aided drug design;0.907
85;Thrombocytopenia and Its Association with Mortality in Patients with COVID-19.;10.1111/jth.14848;BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is spreading rapidly around the world. Thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19 has not been fully studied. OBJECTIVE To describe thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19. METHODS For each of 1476 consecutive patients with COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, nadir platelet count during hospitalization was retrospectively collected and categorized into (0, 50], (50, 100], (100 - 150] or (150 - ) group after taking the unit (× 109/L ) away from the report of nadir platelet count. Nadir platelet counts and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS Among all patients, 238 (16.1%) patients deceased and 306 (20.7%) had thrombocytopenia. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older, were more likely to have thrombocytopenia and had lower nadir platelet counts. The in-hospital mortality was 92.1%, 61.2%, 17.5% and 4.7% for (0, 50], (50, 100], (100 - 150] and (150 - ) group, respectively. With (150 - ) as the reference, nadir platelet counts of (100 - 150], (50, 100] and (0, 50] group had a relative risk of 3.42 (95% CI 2.36 - 4.96), 9.99 (95% CI 7.16 - 13.94) and 13.68 (95% CI 9.89 - 18.92), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Thrombocytopenia is common in patients with COVID-19, and it is associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. The lower the platelet count is, the higher the mortality becomes.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302435/";17/04/2020;CONCLUSIONS Thrombocytopenia;0.9526
86;Laparoscopically Resected Venous Adventitial Cystic Disease that was Difficult to Distinguish from an Ovarian Tumor.;10.7888/juoeh.42.51;Adventitial cystic disease (ACD) is a rare condition in which a mucinous cyst forms within the adventitia, usually in arteries but rarely in veins. A 79-year-old patient presented with stomachache and nausea. Computerized tomography showed pelvic cysts on either side of the pelvis. The right tumor was 120×100 mm, and the left tumor was 45×35 mm. Our diagnosis was bilateral ovarian tumors and we performed laparoscopic tumor resection. In the abdominal cavity, we saw that the left ovary was swollen by about 3-4 cm and the right ovary was normal size. There was a mucous cyst located in the right retroperitoneal cavity that adhered around and bordered the right external iliac vein and the right obturator nerve. We peeled the adhesion away carefully and resected the tumor but the operation caused temporary obturator nerve paralysis. From pathological examination, we diagnosed the right retroperitoneal cyst to be venous ACD originating from the right external iliac vein. We found that venous ACD can grow as large as a pelvic tumor and is difficult to distinguish from an ovarian tumor, which is why we chose laparoscopic surgery. In this case, we performed the operation laparoscopically and no sequelae or recurrent tumor appeared during a 1-year follow-up. However, graft replacement is sometimes necessary for ACD, thus venous ACD should be considered a differential diagnosis and a surgical strategy should be developed when pelvic tumors are observed.;"https://doi.org/10.7888/juoeh.42.51; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213742/";01/01/2020;Adventitial cystic disease;0.9458
87;Interdisciplinary Telemedicine Services for Huntington's Disease: A 20-Year Experience.;10.1089/tmj.2020.0316;Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that causes impairment in cognitive, motor, and psychological function and requires subspecialty neurological and interdisciplinary care. Access to subspecialty care for HD is restricted by disability from the disease, lack of trained providers, and barriers to care for disadvantaged and rural populations. Program Description: Since 1999, the University of Virginia HD clinic has used telemedicine to provide clinical services, consultation, and staff training. Initially, encounters were scheduled with the neurologist on a case-by-case basis at outlying rural clinics and community hospitals. Since 2015, telemedicine visits have been conducted by the entire interdisciplinary HD team and access has been extended to homes and long-term care facilities. This infrastructure was used to conduct a virtual clinic 2 days after initiation of coronavirus disease (COVID) mitigation. The clinic has continued to provide subspecialty and interdisciplinary care through telemedicine while clinic access has been restricted. A total of 69 individuals have been seen in 127 telemedicine visits, 56 of which were conducted by the interdisciplinary team. Conclusions: Telemedicine can provide high-quality subspecialty neurological and interdisciplinary care for HD that offers continuity across a wide range of care settings, and can overcome both anticipated and unanticipated barriers to access.;"https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021901/";06/10/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9865

Methods A total of 204 Malaysian parents of children aged 2 to 11 years old were recruited for this study using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling approaches. Parents were required to fill an online questionnaire hosted on Google Forms, which consisted of socio-demographic characteristics (including child's gender, age, and ethnicity, as well as parental income during the MCO) and a 35-item list from the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ). Data analysis was conducted by further stratifying the children's eating behaviour according to socio-demographic characteristics. Results No significant differences were observed in the eating behaviour of the children across age and parental income groups during the MCO. Malaysian Indian children had significantly lower mean scores for the food responsiveness (2.50±0.64) and emotional over-eating (2.13±0.72) subscales than Malaysian Chinese children. Girls had a significantly higher mean score for the slowness in eating subscale during the MCO than boys. Conclusion Children's eating behaviour were comparable across socio-demographic characteristics.

In Hong Kong, clinicians and other healthcare personnel collaborated closely to combat the outbreak of COVID-19 and minimize the cross-transmission of disease among hospital staff members. In the field of otorhinolaryngology—head and neck surgery (OHNS) and its various subspecialties, contingency plans were required for patient bookings in outpatient clinics, surgeries in operating rooms, protocols in wards and other services. Infected patients may shed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) particles into their environments via body secretions. Therefore, otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel in this specialty face a high risk of contracting COVID-19 and must remain vigilant when performing examinations and procedures involving the nose and throat. In this article, we share our experiences of the planning and logistics undertaken to provide safe and efficient OHNS practices over the last 2 months, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among cases of TIBOLA, a case of scalp eschar and neck lymphadenopathy after tick bite (SENLAT) is diagnosed when an eschar is present on the scalp, accompanied by peripheral lymphadenopathy (LAP). Only a few cases of SENLAT caused by Bartonella henselae have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old male sought medical advice while suffering from high fever and diarrhea. Three weeks before the visit, he had been hunting a water deer, and upon bringing the deer home discovered a tick on his scalp area. Symptoms occurred one week after hunting, and a lump was palpated on the right neck area 6 days after the onset of symptoms. Physical examination upon presentation confirmed an eschar-like lesion on the right scalp area, and cervical palpation revealed that the lymph nodes on the right side were non-painful and enlarged at 2.5 × 1.5 cm. Fine needle aspiration of the enlarged lymph nodes was performed, and results of nested PCR for the Bartonella internal transcribed spacer (ITS) confirmed B. henselae as the causative agent. CONCLUSION: With an isolated case of SENLAT and a confirmation of B. henselae in Korea, it is pertinent to raise awareness to physicians in other Asian countries that B. henselae could be a causative agent for SENLAT.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7066777/;12/03/2020;Tick-borne lymphadenopathy;0.9306
92;Generating Game Levels to Develop Computer Science Competencies in Game-Based Learning Environments;10.1007/978-3-030-52240-7_44;Game-based learning environments hold significant potential for supporting K-12 computer science (CS) education by providing CS learning experiences embedded within engaging virtual worlds. However, many game-based learning environments do not adaptively support individual students based on their specific knowledge and skills. Often, this is because creating game levels is highly labor-intensive, which limits the number of levels created to support student learning. Procedural content generation (PCG) is a promising direction for addressing this challenge by dynamically creating game levels that address specific student needs without requiring extensive development effort. In this paper, we investigate a PCG framework driven by answer set programming (ASP), a variant of logic programming that utilizes well-formed logical rules to express constraints for valid game levels. We demonstrate how variations in CS learning objectives and game-playing skills can be incorporated into ASP-based rules to generate learner-adaptive levels in a middle-grades CS game-based learning environment. Evaluations of the generated levels suggest that the ASP-based level generator not only reliably generates desired CS educational game levels but also synthesizes a large set of diverse game levels. The findings suggest that the ASP-based PCG approach has considerable promise for creating highly engaging and adaptive game-based learning experiences for K-12 CS education.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334711/;10/06/2020;Procedural content generation;0.9495
93;Rabies encephalitis and extra-neural manifestations in a patient bitten by a domestic cat.;10.1590/s1678-9946202062001;"Rabies encephalitis is a fatal zoonotic viral disease transmitted to humans either by domestic animals like dogs and cats or by wild animals like bats, skunks and raccoons. We present the case of a 25-year-old woman admitted due to behavioral disorders, generalized paresthesiasand acute respiratory deterioration compatible with a respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring orotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation and empirical initiation of antibiotic and antiviral therapy. Chest tomography showed pneumomediastinum and changes suggestive of pulmonary infection. In the presence of neurological symptoms, a central nervous system (CNS) infection was suspected and the cerebrospinal fluid showed no pleocytosis, hiperproteinorrachy without glucose consumption; cranial CT scan was normal. During hospitalization, the family reported that the patient was bitten by a cat 30-day prior to the onset of rabies-like symptoms, and the animal was sacrificed. The patient had an unfavorable clinical evolution, with electroencephalographic activity dissociation evidenced by video telemetry. The zoonotic exposure led to the suspected diagnosis of rabies infection. The patient died and the suspected diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology, with presence of Negri bodies on cerebellum Purkinje cells and a positive immunofluorescence test for rabies virus. Both, initial extra-neural manifestations and late reporting of rabies exposure led to delayed diagnosis.";"https://doi.org/10.1590/s1678-9946202062001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31967209/";01/01/2020;respiratory distress syndrome;0.9701
94;A Novel Hybrid Membrane VAD as First Step Toward Hemocompatible Blood Propulsion.;10.1007/s10439-020-02590-1;Heart failure is a raising cause of mortality. Heart transplantation and ventricular assist device (VAD) support represent the only available lifelines for end stage disease. In the context of donor organ shortage, the future role of VAD as destination therapy is emerging. Yet, major drawbacks are connected to the long-term implantation of current devices. Poor VAD hemocompatibility exposes the patient to life-threatening events, including haemorrhagic syndromes and thrombosis. Here, we introduce a new concept of artificial support, the Hybrid Membrane VAD, as a first-of-its-kind pump prototype enabling physiological blood propulsion through the cyclic actuation of a hyperelastic membrane, enabling the protection from the thrombogenic interaction between blood and the implant materials. The centre of the luminal membrane surface displays a rationally-developed surface topography interfering with flow to support a living endothelium. The precast cell layer survives to a range of dynamically changing pump actuating conditions i.e., actuation frequency from 1 to 4 Hz, stroke volume from 12 to 30 mL, and support duration up to 313 min, which are tested both in vitro and in vivo, ensuring the full retention of tissue integrity and connectivity under challenging conditions. In summary, the presented results constitute a proof of principle for the Hybrid Membrane VAD concept and represent the basis for its future development towards clinical validation.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-020-02590-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901382/";08/09/2020;ventricular assist device;0.9545
95;Virus-host interactome and proteomic survey of PMBCs from COVID-19 patients reveal potential virulence factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis;10.1101/2020.03.31.019216;The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global public health concern due to relatively easy person-to-person transmission and the current lack of effective antiviral therapy. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized SARS-CoV-2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact with NKRF, a NF-КB repressor, and may precipitate the strong IL-8/IL-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Our integrative study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks to reflect disease etiology, but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms and represents a powerful resource in the quest for therapeutic intervention.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.019216;02/04/2020;coronavirus disease;0.983
96;Development Trend of Infectious Disease Hospitals in China 2002–2018: A Longitudinal Analysis of National Survey Data;10.2147/rmhp.s287841;BACKGROUND: Infectious disease hospitals (IDHs) play very important roles in the battle against the infectious disease. The present study aims to systematically analyze the development trends and possible problems of IDHs in China. METHODS: Most of the data came from the China Health Statistics Yearbook 2003–2019. Joinpoint Regression Model was used to analyze the development trends of IDHs between 2002 and 2018. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2018, the number of IDHs in China increased from 126 to 167, with an average annual percent change (AAPC) of 1.82%. The ratio of nurses to beds increased from 0.38 to 0.46 with the AAPC of 0.88%, and average business housing area per bed increased with an AAPC of 1.97%. The percentage of liabilities to total assets increased year by year and the percentage of medical business costs to total expenditure decreased. The segmented trend of daily visits per physician from 2014 to 2018 was stable, and the segmented trend of daily inpatients per physician from 2012 to 2018 decreased significantly. In 2017, the rates of surgical inpatients leaving the hospital without the doctor’s advice and surgical inpatients mortality were higher than 2016. CONCLUSION: Although the development of IDHs was generally good in China, the scale of IDHs was generally small, the ability to respond to major emergencies was weak, the problem of irrational resource allocation was still prominent, and the operation of IDHs was facing a dilemma.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469398/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s287841";13/01/2021;Infectious disease hospitals;0.9176
97;720 Outcomes of Conservative Management of Acute Appendicitis During The COVID-19 Pandemic;10.1093/bjs/znab134.078;"INTRODUCTION: During the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, appendicitis was managed conservatively to reduce peri-operative mortality; spread of infection; and hospital admissions. We describe the outcomes observed from conservative management during the pandemic. METHOD: This prospective single centre study included all patients with clinically acute appendicitis between 31/3/2020 to 31/5/2020. Length of admission and 30-day complications were recorded. This was compared to retrospective data from 31/3/2019 to 31/4/2019. RESULTS: Of the 35 patients included between 31/3/2020 to 31/5/2020: 19 patients were managed conservatively with antibiotics; 8 required operative management after trial of antibiotics; and 8 required surgery on admission. Of the initially conservatively managed patients, three suffered complications (Clavien Dindo >1). Length of admission in conservative patients averaged 1.3 days (0-5 day range). In May 2019, 30 patients admitted with clinical appendicitis were all managed with appendicectomy. The average admission was 2.93 days (1-50 day range) with 4 patient complications. There was no difference (P = 0.22) when comparing the length of admissions within the pandemic and non-pandemic cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates no increase in complications or length of admission during the pandemic. We support the recommendation that conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis is continued during the COVID-19 pandemic.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135878/;04/05/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.979
98;Opioid and neuroHIV Comorbidity – Current and Future Perspectives;10.1007/s11481-020-09941-8;With the current national opioid crisis, it is critical to examine the mechanisms underlying pathophysiologic interactions between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and opioids in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent advances in experimental models, methodology, and our understanding of disease processes at the molecular and cellular levels reveal opioid-HIV interactions with increasing clarity. However, despite the substantial new insight, the unique impact of opioids on the severity, progression, and prognosis of neuroHIV and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are not fully understood. In this review, we explore, in detail, what is currently known about mechanisms underlying opioid interactions with HIV, with emphasis on individual HIV-1-expressed gene products at the molecular, cellular and systems levels. Furthermore, we review preclinical and clinical studies with a focus on key considerations when addressing questions of whether opioid-HIV interactive pathogenesis results in unique structural or functional deficits not seen with either disease alone. These considerations include, understanding the combined consequences of HIV-1 genetic variants, host variants, and μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and HIV chemokine co-receptor interactions on the comorbidity. Lastly, we present topics that need to be considered in the future to better understand the unique contributions of opioids to the pathophysiology of neuroHIV.

99;Phase Angle and Frailty are Important Prognostic Factors in Critically ILL Medical Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study;10.1007/s12603-020-1487-0;"OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether phase angle (PhA) measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and frailty are associated with the outcomes of critical illnesses. DESIGN: A single-center prospective cohort study. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit (ICU) in Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. PARTICIPANTS: 97 patients who were admitted to the medical ICU. MEASUREMENTS: On admission, PhA was measured by BIA, and frailty was assessed by the Korean Modified Barthel Index (KMBI) scoring system. Patients were classified according to PhA and KMBI scores, and their impact on the outcomes of critical illnesses was evaluated. RESULTS: The patients’ mean age was 62.4 ± 16.4 years, and 56 of the patients (57.7%) were men. Having a high PhA above 3.5 at the time of ICU admission was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.42, p =.042), and a shorter duration of ICU stay (5.6 days vs. 9.8 days, p =.016) compared to those with a low PhA. Other indices measured by BIA were not significantly associated with outcomes of critical illnesses. Frailty (KMBI > 60) was associated with more mechanical ventilation days (2.3 days vs. 7.1 days; p =.018). CONCLUSION: Both PhA and frailty are important prognostic factors predicting the outcomes of critical illnesses. Low PhA scores were associated with increased mortality and a longer duration of ICU stay, and frailty was associated with more mechanical ventilation days.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7548529/;12/10/2020;ICU stay;0.9479
100;Social Support Promotes Mental Health During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Study from Turkey.;10.24869/psyd.2021.217;BACKGROUND Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has several negative effects on mental health, given its rapid transmission, hygiene and isolation measures and associated social and financial difficulties. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mental health burden of the Turkish population and vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 outbreak, especially exploring the effects of social support. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We assessed depression, anxiety, stress symptoms and perceived social support among 894 people all over Turkey, using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) two months after the declaration of the first COVID-19 case in Turkey. RESULTS According to DASS-21 subscale scores, the findings showed that the prevalence of moderate to severe depression, anxiety and stress-related symptoms was 24.8%, 21.9% and 12.6%, respectively. Female gender, being single, having a lifetime psychiatric disorder, lower education level and financial concerns were significantly associated with higher DASS-21 scores. Also, there was a negative correlation between all subgroups of perceived social support, especially from the family, and the total DASS-21 score. CONCLUSIONS Vulnerable groups should be identified and protected to reduce adverse psychiatric outcomes of COVID-19. Besides, further strategies should be provided to maintain protective factors, such as social support, under stressful conditions.;"https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185753/";01/01/2021;BACKGROUND Coronavirus-19;0.9427
101;De novo design of picomolar SARS-CoV-2 miniprotein inhibitors.;10.1101/2020.08.03.234914;"We used two approaches to design proteins with shape and chemical complementarity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein near the binding site for the human ACE2 receptor. Scaffolds were built around an ACE2 helix that interacts with the RBD, or de novo designed scaffolds were docked against the RBD to identify new binding modes. In both cases, designed sequences were optimized first in silico and then experimentally for target binding, folding and stability. Nine designs bound the RBD with affinities ranging from 100pM to 10nM, and blocked bona fide SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with IC 50 values ranging from 35 pM to 35 nM; the most potent of these - 56 and 64 residue hyperstable proteins made using the second approach - are roughly six times more potent on a per mass basis (IC 50 ~ 0.23 ng/ml) than the best monoclonal antibodies reported thus far. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer in complex with the two most potent minibinders show that the structures of the designs and their binding interactions with the RBD are nearly identical to the computational models, and that all three RBDs in a single Spike protein can be engaged simultaneously. These hyperstable minibinders provide promising starting points for new SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, and illustrate the power of computational protein design for rapidly generating potential therapeutic candidates against pandemic threats.";"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.03.234914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32793905/";03/08/2020;receptor binding domain;0.9274

It has rapidly spread over 216 countries, including the USA, UK, Europe, Russia, and many Asian countries. It has affected more than 4.5 million people, and around 0.3 million deaths have been reported globally. Many preventive measures have been adopted worldwide to mitigate its spread. The government of Pakistan has also taken many preventive measures to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, such as rapid response by governance, continuous monitoring of the pandemic spread in the affected areas, and integration of resources from multiple sectors, including health, education, defense, and media. According to global statistics, the number of COVID-19 cases in the country remained remarkably lower than the expected number for the first 169 days, as compared to other countries. A total of 286,674 confirmed cases, including 16,475 active, 6,139 deaths, and 264,060 (92%) recoveries were reported. The study finds that strict adherence to national policies, effective governance, and unity at the national level resulted in better outcomes. Hence, the preventive measures, rapid responses, and strategies adopted for combating the challenges could be adopted as a learning tool for other countries having similar work environments and financial constraints.

103;Central Venous Catheter Insertion in the Prone Position-A Last Resort in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients.;10.1177/0885066620959649;BACKGROUND In the setting of the COVID pandemic, many patients falling ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome eventually require prone positioning for gas exchange. Traditionally, central venous catheters are inserted with patient in the supine or Trendelenburg position. However, when a patient cannot tolerate supine position and the need for central venous access is urgent, catheter placement may be considered with the patient in the prone position. CASE SUMMARY A 69-year-old male with rapidly declining respiratory status secondary to COVID pneumonia quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, was rapidly intubated, and then placed in the prone position. Patient could not tolerate the supine position even briefly and required a central venous catheter insertion for continuous renal replacement therapy. We kept the patient in the prone position and successfully inserted a central venous catheter in such position with real-time ultrasound guidance and using micropuncture technique. CONCLUSION In the setting of the COVID pandemic, many cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome require patients to be prone in order to improve gas exchange. In the most severe situations, these patients would not be able to tolerate rotating back to the supine position but would still require central venous catheter insertion urgently. We demonstrated feasibility of central venous catheter insertion in the prone position in these severely ill patients.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620959649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935610/";16/09/2020;BACKGROUND;0.982
104;Food safety, hygiene, and awareness during combating of COVID-19;10.1016/b978-0-323-85780-2.00002-0;Novel coronavirus is a family of viruses that usually leads to respiratory illness. This coronavirus pandemic has affected human life drastically, and there is a chance that this virus persists on raw foods of animal origin. Also, food that is served to the customers by retail sectors passes through different operational steps, which involves multiple touchpoints by the food handlers on the surface of the food or to the food directly. This may lead to the spreading of the coronavirus through the food sector if proper hygiene, sanitization, and disinfection, social distancing, and other preventive measures are not followed. This chapter will give an overview of the type of foodborne viruses and their effects on human health. It will also provide an understanding of the possibilities of transmitting coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through food and food packaging. The review will also focus on the preventive measures, hygiene practices, and safety precautions that should be adopted by the food handlers or food business owners to mitigate the risk of transmitting COVID-19 in the food service and retail sector. Essential aspects of the food safety management system with respect to COVID-19 will be discussed, which should be followed by all the food companies. Finally, the role of different dietary supplements and bioactive ingredients of foods and herbs will be discussed that are known to improve the human immune system, which will fight against the virus.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323857802000020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323857802000020";28/06/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9304

To ensure continuity of cancer genetic counseling at a large academic medical center while also promoting the safety of patients and staff, our team transitioned to fully remote telephone genetic counseling and testing services within 48 hr. We compare differences in the six weeks following the shift to telephone genetic counseling (post-COVID) to the six weeks preceding the pandemic (pre-COVID). We maintained 99% of our total visit capacity and saw a decrease in patient no-show rate from 9.5% to 7.3%. Of all patients who received telephone genetic counseling, fewer consented to genetic testing as compared to patients seen in-person prior to the pandemic (79% pre-COVID v. 72% post-COVID; p = .012). Four weeks after this cohort was closed for analysis, 96 out of 303 samples (32%) had not been received by the genetic testing laboratory, despite at least one reminder phone call to the patient. In 13 reported instances, a second sample was required (quality not sufficient, lost or mislabeled sample), thus delaying test results. We conclude that a rapid transition to remote genetic counseling and testing allowed uninterrupted access to cancer genetics services during to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The required primary data were gathered from the end-users of mHealth in Bangladesh. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, this study has confirmed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, and facilitating conditions have a positive influence on behavioral intention whereas health consciousness has an impact on both intention and actual usage behavior. mHealth usage behavior has an affirmative and meaningful effect on the mental well-being of the service users. Moreover, self-quarantine has strong influence on actual usage behavior but does not moderate the intention-behavior relationship. In addition, due to the existence of a non-linearity problem in the data set, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was engaged to sort out relatively significant predictors acquired from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). However, this study contributes to the emergent mHealth literature by revealing how the use of the mHealth services elevates the quality of patients' mental well-being under this pandemic situation.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705856/";08/03/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9879

Considering that symptomatic patients with COVID‐19 generally undergo multidrug treatments, the occurrence of a possible adverse drug reaction presenting with cutaneous manifestations should be contemplated. Pleomorphic skin eruptions occurred in a 59‐year‐old Caucasian woman, affected by a stable form of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine sulfate, darunavir, ritonavir, sarilumb, omeprazole, ceftriaxone, high‐flow oxygen therapy devices, filgrastim (Zarzio®) as a single injection, and enoxaparin. The patient stopped all treatment but oxygen and enoxaparin were continued and the patient received a high‐dose Desametasone with complete remission of dermatological impairment in 10 days.

Most current masks used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are typically absence of biocidal properties. We designed a novel polymer, polystyrene grafted by 5, 5-dimethylhydantoin and trimethylamine (PSDT), which possesses halamine site and cationic quaternary ammonia salt site. Furthermore, PSDT/PU nanofiber@net membranes (PSDT/PU NNMs) were obtained by electrospinning technology. Our strategy enables inherent N-halamine and quaternary ammonia salt (QAS) group to be covalently integrated into membranes, realizing the efficient and stable biocidal properties. Meanwhile, the introduction of nanonets endows electrospun membranes with prominent air filtration performance. The resulting membranes exhibit integrated properties of high interception of fine particles (96.7%) and low pressure drop (95.4 Pa). Besides, chlorinated PSDT/PU nanofiber@net membranes (with active chlorine content of 0.60 wt% and quaternary ammonia salt content of 2.20 wt%) exhibited superior bactericidal (>99.9999%) and virucidal (>99.999%) efficiency in a short time (2 min), which enables chlorinated PSDT/PU NNMs to be served as the filtration material by providing bacterial interception (99.77%) and contact killing against pathogens.

However, reactogenicity, such as fever, caused by innate immune responses to the vaccine formulation remains to be improved. Here, we optimized a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based mRNA vaccine candidate, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (LNP-mRNA-RBD), which showed improved immunogenicity by removing reactogenic materials from the vaccine formulation and protective potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection in cynomolgus macaques. LNP-mRNA-RBD induced robust antigen-specific B cells and follicular helper T cells in the BALB/c strain but not in the C57BL/6 strain; the two strains have contrasting abilities to induce type I interferon production by dendritic cells. Removal of reactogenic materials from original synthesized mRNA by HPLC reduced type I interferon (IFN) production by dendritic cells, which improved immunogenicity. Immunization of cynomolgus macaques with an LNP encapsulating HPLC-purified mRNA induced robust anti-RBD IgG in the plasma and in various mucosal areas, including airways, thereby conferring protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, fine-tuning the balance between the immunogenic and reactogenic activity of mRNA-based vaccine formulations may offer safer and more efficacious outcomes.";https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.04.433852;04/03/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9624

Out of the included studies, most originated from the United States (n=12), 5 from Europe, 2 from China and 1 from Australia. Strategies described to limit the spread and impact of the virus could be divided into 9 distinct categories, including the suspension of non-essential services, use of telemedicine, use of personal protective equipment, screening patients for COVID-19, restructuring the healthcare team, adapting standard management practices, using distance-learning for trainees, promoting public education and initiatives, and minimising intra-hospital viral transmission. The ever-changing nature of the COVID-19 may prompt plastic surgeons to adapt special strategies as pandemic progresses and subsequently declines. The findings of this review can prove beneficial to other plastic surgery departments in informing their response strategies to the pandemic and in a second wave of the disease.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjps.2020.08.088; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1748681520304320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32950410/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1748681520304320?v=s5";07/09/2020;coronavirus disease-19;0.9088

PURPOSE This study examined 159 counties within Georgia to identify community characteristics associated with county-level COVID-19 case, hospitalization, and death rates. METHODS Data from the 2020 County Health Rankings, the 2010 US Census, and the Georgia Department of Public Health COVID-19 Daily Status Report were linked using county Federal Information Processing Standard codes and evaluated through multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS The percentages of children in poverty, severe housing problems, and people not proficient in the English language were significant predictors associated with increases in case, hospitalization, and death rates. Diabetic prevalence was significantly associated with increases in the hospitalization and death rates; in contrast, the percentages of people with excessive drinking and female were inversely associated with hospitalization and death rates. Other independent variables showing an association with death rate included the percentages of people reporting fair or poor health and American Indian/Alaska Native.

Tackling the pandemic in those countries is challenging due to the fragility of socioeconomic and health systems. Palestine is one of those countries that is facing compounding challenges, instability, fragility, living conditions, poverty, and mobility, all of which are caused by multifactorial etiology. The Pandemic shows triple tragedies; virus (COVID-19 Pandemic), ongoing Israeli occupation (Politics), and Intra-Palestinian divide (Policies). Yet, Palestine's response to the pandemic is outperforming many countries in the region. The early preventative lockdown measures in the West Bank found effective and not overwhelming the already over-stretched health system. While in the Gaza Strip, the response was slow. Prisoners, labours, besieged people, socioeconomic-disadvantaged classes, and refugees were put at additional high risk. Nonetheless, measures taken were unconsolidated in both regions largely due to the political factors. A little collaboration and inter-agency task forces in preparedness and response was observed, and the mechanisms and governance remain ambiguous. A consolidated and evidence-based nation-wide plan is required, whereby state and non-state actors have a clear and transparent exit strategy. A new thinking approach to promote the public health system and evidence-informed policies in Palestine is an urgent national priority.";"https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1781914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32552389/";17/06/2020;virus;0.9972
114;Decentralized governance may lead to higher infection levels and sub-optimal releases of quarantines amid the COVID-19 pandemic;10.1101/2020.05.20.20108167;The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has lead countries worldwide to administer quarantine policies. However, each country or state decides independently what mobility restrictions to administer within its borders, while aiming to maximize its own citizens' welfare. In turn, since individuals travel between countries and states, at least during periods when quarantines are less restrictive, the policy in one country may ultimately affect the infection level in other countries. Therefore, major questions are whether the policy dictated by a decentralized government is efficient, and if not, how the governments can coordinate a better policy. Here, we focus on the decision regarding the timing of releasing the quarantines. We consider a game theory model in which each of two governments decides when to switch from a restrictive to a non-restrictive quarantine and vice versa. We used parameter values driven by the literature and publically available data. We show that, if travel is sufficiently frequent during the non-restrictive quarantine periods, then the strategies are sub-optimal: Each governor tends to release the quarantine sooner, which ultimately leads to longer periods of restrictive quarantines and a higher prevalence of the disease. In turn, if the governments restrict international and interstate travel to a low level even when the quarantines are non-restrictive, the policy dictated by the decentralized governance may become optimal.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.20108167; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.20.20108167v1?rss=1";25/05/2020;Coronavirus;0.9849

This study aimed to determine the differences in health behaviors and related factors among rural and urban residents in China. METHODS: From February 14 to 22, 2020, during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, a total of 2449 participants (1783 (72.81%) urban residents and 666 (27.19%) rural residents) were recruited by snowball sampling on WeChat and QQ social platforms, both owned by Tencent. Data were collected through the Web-questionnaire guided by an information–motivation–behavioral skills model. The multiple-group structural equation model was applied to analyze the factors. RESULTS: Rural residents had lower health behavior scores than urban residents, even after adjusting demographic characteristics (33.86 vs 34.29, P = 0.042; total score was 40). Motivational, behavioral skills, and stress had direct positive and negative influences on health behaviors of urban and rural residents. Information and positive perception of interventions had direct effects on health behaviors in rural residents, but not in urban residents. All the factors were mediated by behavioral skills in rural and urban residents.

116;Calidad de la visión en endoscopia en tiempos de pandemia: ¿Influyen los EPP en la calidad visual durante la endoscopia digestiva?;10.1016/j.gastrohep.2020.10.009;INTRODUCTION: In the midst of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) pandemic, health professionals, specifically gastroenterologists, have had to use personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce contact with droplets and aerosols generated during gastrointestinal endoscopy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the use of two types of PPE on quality of vision during gastrointestinal endoscopy. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational pilot study in gastroenterologists who undergo an ophthalmological examination of visual acuity and quality of vision when using two types of PPE. Type #1: 3M N95 1860 green respirator + 3M mono safety glasses + protective screen. Type #2: 3M 6800 full facepiece + 3M NIOSH 7093C HF/P100 filters. RESULTS: Visual acuity and quality of vison parameters while using the PPE that is routinely used when performing gastrointestinal endoscopy during the pandemic were evaluated. It was found that Modality #1 was associated with decreases of up to 37% in visual acuity, 25% in colour visualisation and 75% in contrast sensitivity among digestive endoscopists within minutes of placement. These figures worsened over the course of the procedure, rising to 75%, 60% and 100%, respectively. Modality #2 was not associated with any deterioration in quality of vision. CONCLUSIONS: The different PPE modalities used during gastrointestinal endoscopy could have an impact on the quality of endoscopy studies performed during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211649/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2020.10.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S021057052030409X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S021057052030409X";05/11/2020;SARS-CoV-2 virus;0.9779

In addition, four different coping strategies were investigated. The study was conducted in Germany with data from 665 participants (53.8% female; 18–73 years), who completed an online questionnaire in April 2020. The results revealed that COVID‐19 worry was associated with impaired well‐being and sleep. Meaning‐ and problem‐focused coping were the most frequently used coping strategies, and showed positive associations with well‐being and sleep. Social and avoidance coping were associated with decreased well‐being and worse sleep outcomes. Three coping strategies showed moderating effects. People who worried more showed higher levels of positive affect when they used problem‐focused coping compared to those who did not. Similarly, highly worried participants showed lower levels of negative affect when they reported using meaning‐focused coping more often. In contrast, social coping increased the risk of high negative affect levels in worried participants.

118;Res(Uhu)Rge: A Low Cost and Fully Functional Ventilator Indicated for Application in COVID-19 Patients;10.3390/s20236774;Although the cure for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) will come in the form of pharmaceutical solutions and/or a vaccine, one of the only ways to face it at present is to guarantee the best quality of health for patients, so that they can overcome the disease on their own. Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce. This article shows the race against time of a multidisciplinary research team at the University of Huelva, UHU, southwest of Spain, to develop an inexpensive, multifunctional, and easy-to-manufacture ventilator, which has been named ResUHUrge. The device meets all medical requirements and is developed with open-source hardware and software.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260852/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s20236774";27/11/2020;SARS-CoV-2 virus;0.9592
119;Could automated analysis of chest X-rays detect early bronchiectasis in children?;10.1007/s00431-021-04061-8;Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is increasingly described in the paediatric population. While diagnosis is by high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays (CXRs) remain a first-line investigation. CXRs are currently insensitive in their detection of bronchiectasis. We aim to determine if quantitative digital analysis allows CT features of bronchiectasis to be detected in contemporaneously taken CXRs. Regions of radiologically (A) normal, (B) severe bronchiectasis, (C) mild airway dilation and (D) other parenchymal abnormalities were identified in CT and mapped to corresponding CXR. An artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was used to characterise regions of classes A, B, C and D. The algorithm was then tested in 13 subjects and compared to CT scan features. Structural changes in CT were reflected in CXR, including mild airway dilation. The areas under the receiver operator curve for ANN feature detection were 0.74 (class A), 0.71 (class B), 0.76 (class C) and 0.86 (class D). CXR analysis identified CT measures of abnormality with a better correlation than standard radiological scoring at the 99% confidence level. Conclusion: Regional abnormalities can be detected by digital analysis of CXR, which may provide a low-cost and readily available tool to indicate the need for diagnostic CT and for ongoing disease monitoring.

120;The Use of Digitally Assessed Stress Levels to Model Change Processes in CBT - A Feasibility Study on Seven Case Examples;10.3389/fpsyt.2021.613085;In psychotherapy research, the measurement of treatment processes and outcome are predominantly based on self-reports. However, given new technological developments, other potential sources can be considered to improve measurements. In a feasibility study, we examined whether Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) using digital phenotyping (stress level) can be a valuable tool to investigate change processes during cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Seven outpatients undergoing psychological treatment were assessed using EMA. Continuous stress levels (heart rate variability) were assessed via fitness trackers (Garmin) every 3 min over a 2-week time period (6,720 measurements per patient). Time-varying change point autoregressive (TVCP-AR) models were employed to detect both gradual and abrupt changes in stress levels. Results for seven case examples indicate differential patterns of change processes in stress. More precisely, inertia of stress level changed gradually over time in one of the participants, whereas the other participants showed both gradual and abrupt changes. This feasibility study demonstrates that intensive longitudinal assessments enriched by digitally assessed stress levels have the potential to investigate intra- and interindividual differences in treatment change processes and their relations to treatment outcome. Further, implementation issues and implications for future research and developments using digital phenotyping are discussed.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33767638/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.613085";09/03/2021;cognitive behavioral therapy;0.9816

The current study prospectively evaluated parenting behaviors during the pandemic (N=87). Results indicated that all negative affect emotions investigated were positively associated with controlling parenting behaviors. However, only COVID-related fear predicted changes in controlling parenting behaviors across timepoints. Specifically, although controlling parenting behaviors decreased in the overall sample from time 1 to time 2, higher COVID-related fear scores at time 1 predicted maintenance of high levels of controlling parenting behaviors at time 2.

125;Cultivating ethical leadership in the recovery of COVID-19.;10.1111/jonm.13191;AIM The necessity of fostering ethical leadership in the recovery of COVID-19 is proposed. BACKGROUND Supporting physically and emotionally exhausted nurses, whilst ensuring quality standards of care delivery in the recovery phase of COVID-19, requires careful, considerate and proactive planning. EVALUATION Drawing on literature and utilising Lawton and Paez Gabriunas' (2015) integrated ethical leadership framework (purpose, practices, virtues), possible practical suggestions for the operationalisation of ethical leadership are proposed. DISCUSSION Nurse managers must maintain ethical vigilance in order to nurture values driven behaviour, demonstrating empathy and compassion for nurses experiencing physical and emotional exhaustion because of COVID-19. It is important that open dialogue, active listening and self-care interventions exist. Nurse managers have an essential role in inspiring and empowering nurses, building morale and a collective commitment to safe quality care. CONCLUSION Nurse managers need to consider ways of empowering, supporting and enabling nurses to apply ethical standards in every day practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT Fostering ethical nurse leadership requires careful and sensitive planning, as well as charismatic, compassionate and inspirational leaders. Supporting staff through respect, empathy, role modelling and genuine conscientiousness is essential for increasing job performance and sustaining an ethical work environment.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33098735/";24/10/2020;Supporting physically and emotionally exhausted nurses;0.9046

In this study, the authors present the preliminary results (April 1-5, 2020) of a public risk perception study of COVID‑19. MATERIAL AND METHODS The online questionnaire survey was announced in the national TV and radio stations with the nationwide coverage. Respondents were recruited through the website of the University of Ostrava during the first 5 days of the survey (N = 7966). The data covered risk perception with a focus on physical and psychological aspects, the current socio-economic situation and adaptation to the lockdown. The authors used Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, as well as ordered logistic regression, with a significance level of 5% using STATA version 15. RESULTS From the total sample of the respondents aged 40 years on average (a range of 15-87 years), the present study shows that women (p < 0.001) and elderly people (p < 0.001) perceived the health risk related to COVID‑19 as significantly worse than others. Older people (>60 years) perceived their mental health as significantly better than younger participants (p < 0.001).

The results were discussed among all members of the GARIN group, and all members answered a Likert scale questionnaire to assess the degree of support for every recommendation. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery should be screened preoperatively for some micronutrient deficiencies and treated accordingly. A VLCD (Very Low-Calorie Diet) should be used for 4-8 weeks prior to surgery. Postoperatively, a liquid diet should be maintained for a month, followed by a semi-solid diet also for one month. Protein requirements (1-1.5 g/kg) should be estimated using adjusted weight. Systematic use of specific multivitamin supplements is encouraged. Calcium citrate and vitamin D supplements should be used at higher doses than are currently recommended. The use of proton-pump inhibitors should be individualised, and vitamin B12 and iron should be supplemented in case of deficit. All patients, especially pregnant women, teenagers, and elderly patients require a multidisciplinary approach and specialised follow-up. These recommendations and suggestions regarding nutrition management when undergoing bariatric surgery and postoperative follow-up have direct clinical applicability.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640531/";06/07/2020;Very Low-Calorie Diet;0.9414
128;Hand Washing Compliance and COVID-19: A Non-Participatory Observational Study among Hospital Visitors;10.1101/2020.06.02.20120022;Background: Hand washing remains a key measure for intercepting the dispatch of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, hand washing must be perpetuated properly using soap and water for at least 20 seconds. In response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, various hospitals have imposed mandatory hand washing to everyone prior entering the facilities, and when leaving. This study aimed to assess the hand washing compliance among visitors of a university referral hospital. Methods: A non-participatory observational study was conducted in the main entrance of the hospital from April 27 to May 3, 2020, to measure hand washing compliance of its visitors. The quality of hand washing was assessed via direct observation for compliance with the recommended World Health Organization (WHO) core steps. Data were collected using Open Data Kit (ODK) mobile application. Results: A total of 1,282 hospital visitors were observed, of which 874(68.2%) were males. Full hand washing compliances were observed among 0.9% (95% CI: 0.4-1.4) of the visitors. Withal, there was no difference in the compliances between genders (0.9% vs 0.7%, P = 0.745). Conclusion: Despite the fact that proper hand washing with soap and water is proven to be one of the effective ways in preventing the spread of COVID-19, a significant number of hospital visitors did not practice standard hand washing procedures. Improvements in this measure are urgently needed in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.02.20120022; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.02.20120022v1?rss=1";02/06/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9112

The pathogenesis of norovirus and the induced immune response remain poorly understood due to the lack of a robust virus culture system. The monolayers of two secretor-positive Chinese human intestinal enteroid (HIE) lines were challenged with two norovirus pandemic GII.4 Sydney strains. Norovirus RNA replication in supernatants and cell lysates were quantified by RT-qPCR. RNA expression levels of immune-related genes were profiled using PCR arrays. The secreted protein levels of shortlisted upregulated genes were measured in supernatants using analyte-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Productive norovirus replications were achieved in three (75%) out of four inoculations. The two most upregulated immune-related genes were CXCL10 (93-folds) and IFI44L (580-folds). Gene expressions of CXCL10 and IFI44L were positively correlated with the level of norovirus RNA replication (CXCL10: Spearman’s r = 0.779, p < 0.05; IFI44L: r = 0.881, p < 0.01). The higher level of secreted CXCL10 and IFI44L proteins confirmed their elevated gene expression. The two genes have been reported to be upregulated in norovirus volunteer challenges and natural human infections by other viruses. Our data suggested that HIE could mimic the innate immune response elicited in natural norovirus infection and, therefore, could serve as an experimental model for future virus-host interaction and antiviral studies.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7910953/;21/01/2021;RNA replication;0.9882
130;Determinants of Mortality in Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections;10.1007/s13126-020-0568-1;"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) are frequently encountered, with a high mortality despite advances in health care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients presenting with NSTI were prospectively followed up in an attempt to identify factors that were significantly associated with mortality. RESULTS: There were a total of 86 patients [65 males (75.6%) and 21 females (24.4%)] with an overall mortality of 33.7% (29 patients). The average age was 50.37 years and trauma was the commonest aetiology (34 patients, 66.7%). The average duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 10.56 days; the lower limb was most commonly involved (62 patients, 72.09%). Fifty nine patients had comorbidities (commonest being diabetes mellitus in 41). Age above 50 years, symptoms for more than 8.5 days, involved surface area more than 15.5%, of the total body surface, on-admission pulse rate more than 99 beats/minute, systolic blood pressure less than 103 mm Hg, Glasgow scale less than 12, need for inotropes, low hemoglobin, high leukocyte counts, uraemia, deranged coagulation, low serum albumin, and high levels of lactic acid were significant for mortality. On multivariate analysis, only age above 50 years, presence of acidosis and low serum albumin significantly affected survival. CONCLUSION: NSTI carry high mortality. The identification of potential risk factors associated with mortality might help in guiding and optimizing the management of patients who present with NSTI.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982307/;22/03/2021;Necrotizing soft tissue infections;0.9403
131;Short report: factors determining perceived stress among medical staff in radiology departments during the COVID-19 outbreak.;10.1080/13548506.2020.1837390;Medical staff in radiology departments faces a higher risk of infection and a heavier workload during the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. High perceived stress levels endanger physical and mental health and affect work efficiency and patient safety. Therefore, it is urgent to understand the perceived stress levels of medical staff and explore its risk factors. We recruited 600 medical staff from the radiology departments of 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China, to evaluate perceived stress scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. The results showed that the perceived stress level among medical staff in the radiology departments during the COVID-19 outbreak was high and a sense of tension was strongly present. A positive correlation was found between anxiety score and perceived stress. Multivariate analysis showed that risk factors for perceived stress were female, existing anxiety, and fears of being infected at work, an uncontrollable outbreak, and not being able to pay rent or mortgage. Conversely, good knowledge about COVID-19, being unmarried, and working in a higher-grade hospital were protective factors for perceived stress. Therefore, more attention should be given to medical staff in the radiology departments that present the risk factors outlined above. Timely risk assessment of psychological stress and effective intervention measures should be taken for these high-risk groups to keep their perceived stress within normal limits.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2020.1837390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080151/";20/10/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9859
132;Computational Approaches to Discover Novel Natural Compounds for SARS‐CoV‐2 Therapeutics;10.1002/open.202000332;Scientists all over the world are facing a challenging task of finding effective therapeutics for the coronavirus disease (COVID‐19). One of the fastest ways of finding putative drug candidates is the use of computational drug discovery approaches. The purpose of the current study is to retrieve natural compounds that have obeyed to drug‐like properties as potential inhibitors. Computational molecular modelling techniques were employed to discover compounds with potential SARS‐CoV‐2 inhibition properties. Accordingly, the InterBioScreen (IBS) database was obtained and was prepared by minimizing the compounds. To the resultant compounds, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) and Lipinski's Rule of Five was applied to yield drug‐like compounds. The obtained compounds were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies to evaluate their stabilities. In the current article, we have employed the docking based virtual screening method using InterBioScreen (IBS) natural compound database yielding two compounds has potential hits. These compounds have demonstrated higher binding affinity scores than the reference compound together with good pharmacokinetic properties. Additionally, the identified hits have displayed stable interaction results inferred by molecular dynamics simulation results. Taken together, we advocate the use of two natural compounds, STOCK1N‐71493 and STOCK1N‐45683 as SARS‐CoV‐2 treatment regime.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34010501/; https://doi.org/10.1002/open.202000332";19/05/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9798
133;Tele-Rehabilitation with Virtual Reality: A Case Report on the Simultaneous, Remote Training of Two Patients with Parkinson Disease.;10.1097/phm.0000000000001745;ABSTRACT Physical training in Parkinson disease improves motor performance, alleviates nonmotor symptoms, and enhances cognition and quality of life. Nonetheless, adherence to exercise is low and travel costs and time may limit participation and compliance. Training at home can help avoid these burdens and, as needed during the recent global pandemic (COVID-19), reinforce social distancing and reduce the risk of infection. However, training at home requires motivation and self-control and telerehabilitation is time-consuming for both patient and therapist. In recent years, there is growing use of virtual reality and exergaming to increase motivation and adherence for exercising with evidence of improvements in mobility and balance after using virtual reality in the clinic. Here, a novel telerehabilitation training program using a treadmill-virtual reality system for simultaneous training of two patients with Parkinson disease in their homes is described. Remote monitoring software enabled visual and auditory communication with the two patients, allowing the trainer to adapt the settings remotely and provide feedback. Participants received weekly training sessions over 1 yr. The findings show high adherence to training, increased walking duration throughout the sessions, and increased patient confidence, gait speed, and mobility. Training multiple participants simultaneously was feasible, enabling an individualized treatment approach while conserving therapist time.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/phm.0000000000001745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33819924/";01/05/2021;global pandemic;0.9247
134;A Study of Different Deposition Strategies in Direct Energy Deposition (DED) Processes;10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.158;Abstract The stepover of adjacent deposition lines (or beads), when stacking layers to build a 3D-solid shape, is found to be of great importance to minimize voidage and so, improving density of parts produced by the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process. During such process, in which the stacking of layers occurs, the complex thermal activity of metal deposition affects the part geometry, microstructure, physical and mechanical properties. The correlation between deposition path, bead stepover, and the direct effect on the part density, microstructure and geometry distortions are yet to be found in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of deposition paths and bead stepover on the final part geometry form, microhardness and density. In order to do so, four deposition paths (linear, zigzag, chessboard and contour) and beads stepover of 0.44 mm and 0.55 mm were performed on the production of Stainless Steel 316L cubes by a 5-axis laser based DED BeAM Machine Magic800 with laser spot size of 0.80 mm. The paths shown considerable influence on the variation of both final part geometry and density. Contour (spiral-like) was the path, which produced workpieces with finer form and finishing, with density and microhardness closer to the conventional AISI 316L material. The bead stepover was also found to influence the surface finishing, as larger critical valleys between adjacent beads were noticed when using the higher stepover value.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920316103; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920316103";31/12/2020;Directed Energy Deposition;0.9902

However, no reports are available about the effect of the ongoing pandemic on arrhythmias in patients at risk. OBJECTIVE: To describe the effect of COVID‐19 pandemic on arrhythmic burden among high‐risk patients. METHODS: This is a cross‐sectional study on the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) during the pandemic outbreak (study period), compared to the same timeframe in 2019 (reference period). Inclusion criteria were age (>18 years) and having an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). RESULTS: Among 455 patients enrolled (mean age 64.9 ± 15.7 years; 25.1% females and 39.6% with CRTD), in the study period, 45 (9.9%) patients experienced a total of 86 VA; 8 patients (1.7%) required antitachycardia‐pacing (ATP) and 6 (1.3%) at least one shock. In the reference period, a total of 69 events occurred in 36 patients (7.9%). Six patients (1.3%) required ATP and three (0.7%) at least one shock. The number of patients that suffered from any arrhythmic events in the study period (9.9% vs 7.9%) did not significantly differ from the reference period (χ(2) = 1.09, P = .29).

136;Syrian medical, dental and pharmaceutical publication in the last decade: A bibliometric analysis;10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102441;BACKGROUND: Scientific research has an essential role in building up the basics of public health and clinical care. As a developing country, Syria has a limited contribution to scientific research. Besides, the current Syrian crisis has inflicted severe damage to the infrastructure of the country, which, in turn, negatively affected the scientific sphere. This study examines the scientific publishing in Syria from 2011 until 2020. It aims to define the real and deep reasons for the slow-down in publication to get over them, push Syria to keep track of the latest updates, and take its place in scientific research. METHODS: We conducted a bibliometric analysis of articles published in (PubMed and Scopus) Databases from 1/1/2011 until 26/12/2020, using the following search terms ((“Syrian Arab Republic”) OR (Syria) OR (Syrian)) limiting the search to (Affiliation) fields. RESULTS: Syrian medical, dental and pharmaceutical institutions published 1403 papers from 2011 until 2020. There were only 55 papers in 2011, and a peak with 180 papers in 2018. Besides, publications in the last 4 years were 1.135 times more than publications in the last 6 years.

Social isolation as a result of social distancing during the pandemic potentially affects the associations among perceived available peer support, emotional well-being, and depression in university students. The present study examined the associations among university students’ perceived available peer support, emotional well-being (as indicated negatively by loneliness and negative affects and positively by positive affects and hope), and depressive symptoms. During the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in July, 2020, 255 students at a public university in Hong Kong participated in an online-based survey that assessed their perceived available peer support, emotional well-being, and depressive symptoms. Results showed that perceived available peer support negatively contributed to depressive symptoms; both negative and positive indicators of emotional well-being mediated the association between perceived available peer support and depressive symptoms. Our results also suggested that university students showed signs of elevated depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Thus, our study advanced the theoretical understanding of university students’ mental health in the time of a global pandemic.

138;Influence of the COVID‐19 pandemic on an emergency medical service (EMS) system: a population‐based, descriptive study in Osaka, Japan;10.1002/ams2.534;BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus infection (COVID‐19) was confirmed in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and the COVID‐19 pandemic has spread around the world. However, no clinical studies on the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on EMS systems has been conducted worldwide. METHODS: This was a retrospective study with a study period from January 1, 2020 to April 14, 2020. We included the patients transported by ambulance for acute diseases and traffic accidents in Osaka City. The main outcome of this study was the difficulty in hospital acceptance. We calculated the rate of difficulty of hospital acceptance for each month for acute diseases and traffic accidents. RESULTS: Between January 1 to April 14, 2020, 36,981 patients were transported to hospitals by ambulance for acute diseases and 3096 patients for traffic accidents. There was no difference in the proportion of the difficulty in hospital acceptance due to traffic accidents between 2019 and 2020, but there was an increase in the proportion of the difficulty in hospital acceptance due to acute disease after the 13th week (March 25‐March 31) of 2020 compared to that of 2019. The OR in April was 2.17 (95% CI, 1.84‐2.58) for acute disease.

139;The Ubiquitination System within Bacterial Host–Pathogen Interactions;10.3390/microorganisms9030638;Ubiquitination of proteins, like phosphorylation and acetylation, is an important regulatory aspect influencing numerous and various cell processes, such as immune response signaling and autophagy. The study of ubiquitination has become essential to learning about host–pathogen interactions, and a better understanding of the detailed mechanisms through which pathogens affect ubiquitination processes in host cell will contribute to vaccine development and effective treatment of diseases. Pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Salmonella enterica, Legionella pneumophila and Shigella flexneri) encode many effector proteins, such as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), targeting the host ubiquitin machinery and thus disrupting pertinent ubiquitin-dependent anti-bacterial response. We focus here upon the host ubiquitination system as an integral unit, its interconnection with the regulation of inflammation and autophagy, and primarily while examining pathogens manipulating the host ubiquitination system. Many bacterial effector proteins have already been described as being translocated into the host cell, where they directly regulate host defense processes. Due to their importance in pathogenic bacteria progression within the host, they are regarded as virulence factors essential for bacterial evasion. However, in some cases (e.g., Francisella tularensis) the host ubiquitination system is influenced by bacterial infection, although the responsible bacterial effectors are still unknown.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808578/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9030638";19/03/2021;deubiquitinating enzymes;0.983
140;Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neuroimaging scan volumes at a teaching hospital.;10.1177/1971400920988664;BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic led to a widespread socioeconomic shutdown, including medical facilities in many parts of the world. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact on neuroimaging utilisation at an academic medical centre in the United States caused by this shutdown. METHODS Exam volumes from 1 February 2020 to 11 August 2020 were calculated based on patient location, including outpatient, inpatient and emergency, as well as modality type, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. 13 March 2020 was designated as the beginning of the shutdown period for the radiology department and 1 May 2020 was designated as the reopening date. The scan volumes during the pre-shutdown, shutdown and post-shutdown periods were compared using t-tests. RESULTS Overall, neuroimaging scan volumes declined significantly by 41% during the shutdown period and returned to 98% of the pre-shutdown period levels after the shutdown, with an estimated 3231 missed scans. Outpatient scan volumes were more greatly affected than inpatient scan volumes, while emergency scan volumes declined the least during the shutdown. In addition, the magnetic resonance imaging scan volumes declined to a greater degree than the computed tomography scan volumes during the shutdown. CONCLUSION The shutdown from the COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial but transient impact on neuroimaging utilisation overall, with variable magnitude depending on patient location and modality type.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/1971400920988664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472535/";21/01/2021;BACKGROUND;0.9035
141;Clinical applications of mesenchymal stromal cell-based therapies for pulmonary diseases: An Update and Concise Review;10.7150/ijms.59218;Lung disorders are a leading cause of morbidity and death worldwide. For many disease conditions, no effective and curative treatment options are available. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapy is one of the cutting-edge topics in medical research today. It offers a novel and promising therapeutic option for various acute and chronic lung diseases due to its potent and broad-ranging immunomodulatory activities, bacterial clearance, tissue regeneration, and proangiogenic and antifibrotic properties, which rely on both cell-to-cell contact and paracrine mechanisms. This review covers the sources and therapeutic potential of MSCs. In particular, a total of 110 MSC-based clinical applications, either completed clinical trials with safety and early efficacy results reported or ongoing worldwide clinical trials of pulmonary diseases, are systematically summarized following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, including acute/viral pulmonary disease, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), interstitial lung diseases (ILD), chronic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and lung cancer. The results of recent clinical studies suggest that MSCs are a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of lung diseases. Nevertheless, large-scale clinical trials and evaluation of long-term effects are necessary in further studies.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8241779/;01/06/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.91

To support a new controlled human infection (challenge) model seeking to accelerate S. pyogenes vaccine development, we aimed to develop an accurate and reliable molecular method for quantifying bacterial load from pharyngeal swabs collected during experimental human pharyngitis. METHODS: Combined sequential RNA+DNA extraction from throat swabs was compared to traditional separate RNA-only and DNA-only extractions. An emm-type specific qPCR was developed to detect the emm75 challenge strain. Results from the qPCR were compared to culture, using throat swab samples collected in a human challenge study. RESULTS: The qPCR was 100% specific for the emm75 challenge strain when tested against a panel of S. pyogenes emm-types and other respiratory pathogens. Combined RNA+ DNA extraction had similar yield to traditional separate extractions. The combined extraction method and emm75 qPCR had 98.8% sensitivity compared to culture for throat swabs collected from challenge study participants. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a reliable molecular method for measuring S. pyogenes bacterial load from throat swabs collected in a controlled human infection model of S. pyogenes pharyngitis.

AIMS To evaluate the effects of different coping strategies on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS A representative sample for Austria was recruited through Qualtrics® in a period of 4 weeks after the lockdown started. Measurements were coping inventory (SCI), psychological quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF, psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and insomnia (ISI). Regression analyses were performed with coping strategies as predictors and mental health measures as dependent variables. RESULTS The representative sample included N = 1,005 respondents (52.7% women). Positive thinking, active stress coping and social support were found to be positive predictors for psychological life quality, well-being, and negative predictors for perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Alcohol and cigarette consumption was a negative predictor for psychological life quality, and well-being, and a positive predictor for perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Support in faith was a positive predictor for perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS Coping strategies are significant predictors for mental health measures.

Material and Methods The study was conducted from November 2014 to January 2016 in Department of Surgery, Manisa Celal Bayar University Hospital. The study recruited 50 male patients, aged 18 and over and was carried out as a double blinded procedure. Twenty-five patients were randomly selected to receive hernia repair by progrip self-fixating mesh and 25 patients were treated with hernia repair with suture fixation method by using prolene grafts, and patients' pain follow-up was performed with face-to-face or telephone interviews with VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) and return to daily routine activities were evaluated with SF-36 (Short Form-36) quality of life scale. Recurrent hernias and emergency cases were excluded. Results The pain scores were lower and a statistically significant difference was achieved in patients in whom progrip self-fixating mesh was used in the early postoperative period. Both methods gave statistically similar results in terms of pain and quality of life. Conclusion In the literature, there are some evidence that the repair applied with progrip self-fixating graft has more positive outcomes compared to the repairs applied with suture fixation. It is concluded that there is a need for longer follow-ups and larger series of cases in order to achieve a definite result.;"https://doi.org/10.5578/turkjsurg.4451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637875/";01/03/2020;Visual Analogue Scale;0.9753

Hilton’s analysis of the findings of these studies indicated two major findings: (1) when students use OER, they obtain the same learning outcomes as with traditional textbooks while saving money; and (2) both students and teachers find OER comparable to traditional learning resources in terms of quality. Several advantages of OER were also revealed. These included low or no cost of OER, perceived ease of reading and access, their ability to provide the same learning outcomes as traditional materials, and students’ and instructors’ positive perceptions. By indicating the role of OER in obtaining the same or similar learning, the study has also suggested that OER be considered useful sources for classes and also a valid replacement for commercial textbooks. However, we also need to consider the context where OER will be used and how OER are designed and used in this context since these two determine whether OER will work and suffice.

It is useful to examine the theoretical implications of his work by applying a human development theoretical perspective. Phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory (PVEST) is a strengths-based theoretical framework that engages the variability of resource access and coping strategies that promote positive identity development for diverse children. While skill acquisition is a key focus of human capital theory's engagement of early childhood needs, this article highlights the on-going status of human vulnerability that undergirds identity development over the life course. The authors note that ""inequality presence denial"" combines with high-risk contexts, framed by geography and psychohistoric moments (e.g., The Great Recession, COVID-19), to alter diverse children's developmental pathways. The acknowledgement of ""morbid risk"" motivates the urgency for research that builds upon Zigler's innovations and privileges human development imperatives. The case study explores these concepts by examining the challenges and assets available to mothers in a low-income community.

Adding D‐dimers >500 ng/mL to gender and pneumonia at CT scan in ROC curve analysis significantly increased AUC for COVID‐19 diagnosis. COVID‐19 positive patients had significantly more CECs at admission (p=0.008) than COVID‐19 negative ones. COVID‐19 positive patients treated with curative anticoagulant prior to admission had less CECs (p=0.02) than those without. Interestingly, patients treated with curative anticoagulation and ACEi or ARBs had even lesser CECs (p=0.007).

149;Opportunistic physiology: inserting physiology and pathophysiology content into virtually delivered clinical rotations;10.1152/advan.00113.2020;It is important to reinforce physiology and pathophysiology concepts during clinical rotations, which traditionally occur after the foundational sciences in the US medical school system. We took an opportunistic approach when the COVID-19 pandemic forced our content into virtual delivery mode, as clinical medical education required a shift to nonpatient contact. We describe our experience in building a 2-wk course that consisted of online small groups during week 1 and panels and cases during week 2. The physiology content involved faculty-vetted resources, along with both discrete and open-ended focus questions for each learning objective. The course also included mechanical ventilation, and the physiologist utilized discussion points and developed a formative quiz to emphasize the physiology correlates, in addition to the very clinical aspects of mechanical ventilation. There were pathophysiology opportunities with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and multiple-organ system dysfunction among the clinical correlates. Review and recall of the foundational sciences occurred, allowing links between the pre-clerkship and clerkship years that were previously undiscovered in our institution. This virtually delivered medical curriculum related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 is timely, carries high student interest, and can benefit medical students and the communities they serve.;"https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00113.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32880484/";01/12/2020;timely;0.9361

The steady number of newly detected cases increase predetermined the modernization of the global healthcare system, shifting the paradigm of fighting with the COVID-19 pandemic towards maximum resource conservation. The change in the medical care provision for infectious patient's approach led first to a gradual decrease, and then to a complete cessation of planned surgical treatment, outpatient examinations, as well as observation of high-risk patients, which primarily include elderly patients. As a result of this, the key objective of this systematic review was to analyze sources of existing practice of providing urological care to patients of the older age group in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In accordance with the search for the keywords, the study reflects world and its own experience of MSMSU Urology Department in the treatment of age-related patients in the current epidemiological situation. The analysis showed that infectious complications from the urinary system take a leading position among the common complications inherent in elderly patients with COVID-19. The development of catheter-associated infection, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant forms of bacteria, asymptomatic bacteriuria are only a small part of the problems clinicians have to face in newly profiled departments.;"https://doi.org/10.32687/0869-866x-2020-28-s2-1081-1086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33219762/";01/10/2020;coronavirus infection;0.9228

Few studies have used available EMS data to investigate EMS call characteristics and subsequent responses. Methods: Data were extracted from the emergency registry for the period 2013–2017. This included call and rescue vehicle dispatch information. All relationships in analyses and differences in events proportion between 2013 and 2017 were tested against the Pearson’s Chi-Square with a 99% level of confidence. Results: Among the 2,120,838 emergency calls, operators dispatched at least one rescue vehicle for 1,494,855. There was an estimated overall incidence of 96 emergency calls and 75 rescue vehicles dispatched per 1000 inhabitants per year. Most calls were made by private citizens, during the daytime, and were made from home (63.8%); 31% of rescue vehicle dispatches were advanced emergency medical vehicles. The highest number of rescue vehicle dispatches ended at the emergency department (74.7%). Conclusions: Our data showed that, with some exception due to environmental differences, the highest proportion of incoming emergency calls is not acute or urgent and could be more effectively managed in other settings than in an Emergency Departments (ED). Better management of dispatch can reduce crowding and save hospital emergency departments time, personnel, and health system costs.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322302/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8040551";11/12/2020;Emergency Departments;0.9431
152;The Impact and Control of Emerging and Re-Emerging Viral Diseases in the Environment: An African Perspective;10.1007/978-3-030-35296-7_7;Emerging viral infections (EVI), and re-emergent variants of existing ones, are a growing threat to public health worldwide with outbreaks occurring sporadically especially in Africa associated with significant adverse ecological, socioeconomic and public health implications. These pathogens have devised evolved environmental adaptations, including the possession of genomic resistance mutations. Haemorrhagic fever viruses like Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses and respiratory pathogens like the avian and human influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses, most from zoonotic reservoirs, may significantly increase morbidity and mortality in the human population in the nearest future. Likewise, vector-borne zoonotic viral diseases including Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and West Nile, transmitted by arthropods from animal reservoirs, occur frequently in the tropics, exhibiting previously unseen patterns of infection and spread. These patterns are facilitated by many intrinsic factors like mutated sites in the viral genome, and external factors including urbanization, displacement, human migration and climate change. Emerging viruses can easily cross boundaries and pose severe threats to the human populations in new geographical areas. Here, we outline the features of common emergent viruses and factors facilitating their emergence, effects, control and sustained management in the environment.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120784/;05/02/2020;Emerging viral infections;0.9948

Methods All HCWs received an e-mail inviting them to take part in the study. Participants had a nasopharyngeal swab test performed for reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and serological tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (primary study). Additionally, they were invited to complete a questionnaire on their exposure to COVID-19 individuals and their COVID-19-related symptoms (secondary study). Prevalence of antibodies (IgG, IgM or both) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results Seventy nine percent of the hospitalʼs HCWs (N = 2210) took part in the primary study. Antibodies were detected in 61 participants, a prevalence of 2.8% (95% CI: 2.5-3.1). The prevalence was slightly higher in nurses (3.4%), registrars (3.9%), and wardens (3.4%). Thirty nine percent of the primary study participants completed the secondary study questionnaire. Those with positive antibody test results had been in closer contact with COVID-19 individuals (60% vs 92%; p < 0.001). Conclusion After the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in our secondary hospital HCWs was around 2.8%, which is slightly higher than the seroprevalence in the general population in our region.

TMPRSS2 belongs to the type II serine proteases of subfamily TMPRSS, which is characterized by the presence of the serine-protease domain. TMPRSS4 is another TMPRSS member, which has a domain architecture similar to TMPRSS2. TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 have been shown to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their normal physiological roles have not been explored in detail. In this study, we analyzed the amino acid sequences and predicted 3D structures of TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 to understand their functional aspects at the protein domain level. Our results suggest that these proteins are likely to have common functions based on their conserved domain organization. Furthermore, we show that the predicted 3D structure of their serine protease domain has significant similarity to that of plasminogen which dissolves blood clot, and of other blood coagulation related proteins. Additionally, molecular docking analyses of inhibitors of four blood coagulation and anticoagulation factors show the same high specificity to TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 3D structures. Hence, our observations are consistent with the blood coagulopathy observed in COVID-19 patients and their predicted functions based on the sequence and structural analyses offer avenues to understand better and explore therapeutic approaches for this disease.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.26.441280;26/04/2021;coronavirus disease 19;0.9146
155;Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases predict different COVID-19 outcomes, a UK Biobank study;10.1101/2020.11.05.20226605;In December 2019, a coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began infecting humans causing a novel disease, coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). This was first described in the Wuhan province of the People's Republic of China. SARS-CoV-2 spread throughout the world causing a global pandemic. To date, thousands of cases of COVID-19 were reported in the United Kingdom, and over 45,000 patients have died. Some progress has been achieved in managing this disease, but the biological determinants of health, besides age, that affect COVID-19 infectivity and mortality are under scrutiny. Recent studies show that several medical conditions, including diabetes and hypertension, increase the risk of COVID-19 infection and death. The increased vulnerability of the elderly and those with comorbidities, together with the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases with advanced age, led us to investigate the links between neurodegeneration and COVID-19. We analysed the primary health records of 13,338 UK individuals tested for COVID-19 between March and July 2020. We show that a pre-existing diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease predicts the highest risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality among the elderly. In contrast, Parkinson's disease patients were found to be at increased risk of infection but not mortality from COVID-19. We conclude that there are disease-specific differences in COVID-19 susceptibility among patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.20226605; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.05.20226605v1?rss=1";07/11/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9648

The long duration of pathological laboratory tests and the wrong test results led the researchers to focus on different fields. Fast and accurate diagnoses are essential for effective interventions with COVID-19. The information obtained by using X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) images is vital in making clinical diagnoses. Therefore it was aimed to develop a machine learning method for the detection of viral epidemics by analyzing X-ray images. In this study, images belonging to 6 situations, including coronavirus images, are classified. Since the number of images in the dataset is deficient and unbalanced, it is more convenient to analyze these images with hand-crafted feature extraction methods. For this purpose, firstly, all the images in the dataset are extracted with the help of four feature extraction algorithms. These extracted features are combined in raw form. The unbalanced data problem is eliminated by producing feature vectors with the SMOTE algorithm. Finally, the feature vector is reduced in size by using a stacked auto-encoder and principal component analysis to remove interconnected features in the feature vector. According to the obtained results, it is seen that the proposed method has leveraging performance, especially in order to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a short time and effectively.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20048868;06/04/2020;Corona Virus;0.9744
157;COVID TV-Unet: Segmenting COVID-19 Chest CT Images Using Connectivity Imposed Unet;10.1016/j.cmpbup.2021.100007;The novel corona-virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a major outbreak in more than 200 countries around the world, leading to a severe impact on the health and life of many people globally. By October 2020, more than 44 million people were infected, and more than 1,000,000 deaths were reported. Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used as an alternative to the time-consuming RT-PCR test, to detect COVID-19. In this work we propose a segmentation framework to detect chest regions in CT images, which are infected by COVID-19. An architecture similar to a Unet model was employed to detect ground glass regions on a voxel level. As the infected regions tend to form connected components (rather than randomly distributed voxels), a suitable regularization term based on 2D-anisotropic total-variation was developed and added to the loss function. The proposed model is therefore called ”TV-Unet”. Experimental results obtained on a relatively large-scale CT segmentation dataset of around 900 images, incorporating this new regularization term leads to a 2% gain on overall segmentation performance compared to the Unet trained from scratch. Our experimental analysis, ranging from visual evaluation of the predicted segmentation results to quantitative assessment of segmentation performance (precision, recall, Dice score, and mIoU) demonstrated great ability to identify COVID-19 associated regions of the lungs, achieving a mIoU rate of over 99%, and a Dice score of around 86%.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666990021000069; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666990021000069?v=s5";20/04/2021;corona-virus disease;0.9604
158;Thrombosis in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through the prism of Virchow’s triad;10.1007/s10067-020-05275-1;The pathogenesis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is gradually being comprehended. A high number of thrombotic episodes are reported, along with the mortality benefits of heparin. COVID-19 can be viewed as a prothrombotic disease. We overviewed the available evidence to explore this possibility. We identified various histopathology reports and clinical case series reporting thromboses in COVID-19. Also, multiple coagulation markers support this. COVID-19 can be regarded as a risk factor for thrombosis. Applying the principles of Virchow’s triad, we described abnormalities in the vascular endothelium, altered blood flow, and platelet function abnormalities that lead to venous and arterial thromboses in COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with the release of procoagulant plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and hyperimmune response with activated platelets seem to be significant contributors to thrombogenesis in COVID-19. Stratifying risk of COVID-19 thromboses should be based on age, presence of comorbidities, D-dimer, CT scoring, and various blood cell ratios. Isolated heparin therapy may not be sufficient to combat thrombosis in this disease. There is an urgent need to explore newer avenues like activated protein C, PAI-1 antagonists, and tissue plasminogen activators (tPA). These should be augmented with therapies targeting RAAS, antiplatelet drugs, repurposed antiinflammatory, and antirheumatic drugs.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05275-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32654082/";11/07/2020;thrombogenesis;0.9268
159;Estimating the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Iran using epidemic modeling;10.1101/2020.03.20.20038422;Background: As reported by Iranian governments, the first cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections confirmed in Qom, Iran on February 19, 2020 (30 Bahman 1398). The number of identified cases afterward increased rapidly and the novel coronavirus spread to all provinces of the country. This study aimed to fit an epidemic model to the reported cases data to estimate the basic reproduction number (R_0) of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: We used data from February 21, 2020, to April 21, 2020, on the number of cases reported by Iranian governments and we employed the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) epidemic spreading model to fit the transmission model to the reported cases data by tuning the parameters in order to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Iran. Results: The value of reproduction number was estimated 4.86 in the first week and 4.5 in the second week. it decreased from 4.29 to 2.37 in the next four weeks. At the seventh week of the outbreak the reproduction number was reduced below 1. Conclusions: The results indicate that the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was significantly larger than one in the early stages of the outbreak. However, implementing social distancing and preventing travelling on Nowruz (Persian New Year) effectively reduced the reproduction number. Although the results indicate that reproduction number is below one, it is necessary to continue social distancing and control travelling to prevent causing a second wave of outbreak.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20038422;23/03/2020;coronavirus;0.9689
160;The effect of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic and civil unrest on massive transfusion protocol activations in Minneapolis 2020;10.1111/trf.16527;BACKGROUND: The year 2020 presented the transfusion community with unprecedented events and challenges, including the ongoing SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) pandemic, and more recently by civil unrest, following the death of George Floyd in late May of 2020. As a level 1 trauma center located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Hennepin Healthcare (HCMC) offers a unique perspective into the changes in massive transfusion protocol (MTP) activations and usage during this tumultuous period. This may provide insight for addressing similar future events. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: MTP logs from March 2020 to August 2020 were compared to logs from March to August 2019. The data were de‐identified, and MTP activations and component usage were categorized by activation reason. These categories were compared across the 2‐year period to examine the impact of COVID‐19, including stay‐at‐home orders, and civil unrest. RESULTS: For the examined 6 months of the year 2020, there were a total of 140 MTP activations, compared to 143 in 2019. There were more activations for violent trauma (VT) in 2020 than 2019 (44 vs. 32). This increase in activations for VT was offset by a decrease in non‐trauma activations (54 vs. 66). There was a significant increase in the number of components used in VT activations. DISCUSSION: During 2020, the initial mild decrease in MTP activations was followed by a dramatic increase in the number of activations and component usage for VT in June and July of that year.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036601/; https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16527";28/05/2021;SARS‐CoV‐2;0.9927
161;Mandatory preoperative COVID‐19 testing for cancer patients—Is it justified?;10.1002/jso.26187;BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused substantial disruptions in routine clinical care. Emerging data show that surgery in coronavirus disease (COVID)‐positive cases can be associated with worsening of clinical outcomes and increased postoperative mortality. Hence, preoperative COVID‐19 testing for all patients before elective surgery was implemented in our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and sixty‐two asymptomatic cancer patients were preoperatively tested for COVID‐19 using reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction technique with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing. All negative patients were operated within 72 hours, and positive patients were quarantined for a minimum 14 days before re‐swabbing. RESULTS: In our cohort, 21 of 262 (8.0%) asymptomatic preoperative patients, who were otherwise fit for surgery, tested positive. After adequate quarantine and a negative follow‐up test report, 12 of 21 (57%) had an operation. No major postoperative morbidity due to COVID‐19 was noted during the immediate postoperative period before discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSION: Routine preoperative COVID‐19 testing was successful in identifying asymptomatic viral carriers. There was no incidence of symptomatic COVID‐19 disease in the postoperative period, and there was no incidence of morbidity attributable to COVID‐19. These data suggested a beneficial role for mandatory preoperative COVID‐19 testing.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32841386/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26187";25/08/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9898
162;263 Airway, Voice and Swallow Outcomes Following Endotracheal Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation For COVID-19 Pneumonitis: Preliminary Results of a Prospective Cohort Study;10.1093/bjs/znab134.049;INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed exceptional demands on Intensive Care Units (ICU) across the world – particularly requiring patients to be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Laryngeal injury following intubation is a common occurrence, therefore this study aims to analyse airway, voice, and swallow (AVS) outcomes of patients intubated for COVID-19 pneumonitis and compares it to intubated non-COVID-19 respiratory patients and other ICU admissions. METHOD: We collected data from inpatient records, and follow-up clinics on intubated adult patients discharged from a tertiary care hospital ICU between 01/03/20 and 30/04/20. Patients were assessed with the AVS Scale, Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), and Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10). RESULTS: 86 patients were admitted with COVID-19 pneumonitis, 17 patients were admitted with non-COVID-19 respiratory failure, and 26 patients were admitted with a non-respiratory diagnosis. The COVID-19 cohort demonstrated higher rates of AVS difficulties (airway 59% vs 44% and 31%, voice 40% vs 19% and 19%, swallow 21% vs 6% and 12%). VHI-10 and EAT-10 scores showed no significant differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients intubated for COVID-19 pneumonitis reported higher rates of AVS difficulties against non-COVID-19 reasons for intubation. Robust prospective screening protocols are essential to improving patient outcomes by highlighting and therefore managing laryngological sequelae that occur following intubation.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135859/;04/05/2021;respiratory diagnosis;0.9115
163;Challenges and potential for improving the druggability of podophyllotoxin-derived drugs in cancer chemotherapy.;10.1039/d0np00041h;Covering: up to 2020As a main bioactive component of the Chinese, Indian, and American Podophyllum species, the herbal medicine, podophyllotoxin (PTOX) exhibits broad spectrum pharmacological activity, such as superior antitumor activity and against multiple viruses. PTOX derivatives (PTOXs) could arrest the cell cycle, block the transitorily generated DNA/RNA breaks, and blunt the growth-stimulation by targeting topoisomerase II, tubulin, or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. Since 1983, etoposide (VP-16) is being used in frontline cancer therapy against various cancer types, such as small cell lung cancer and testicular cancer. Surprisingly, VP-16 (ClinicalTrials NTC04356690) was also redeveloped to treat the cytokine storm in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in phase II in April 2020. The treatment aims at dampening the cytokine storm and is based on etoposide in the case of central nervous system. However, the initial version of PTOX was far from perfect. Almost all podophyllotoxin derivatives, including the FDA-approved drugs VP-16 and teniposide, were seriously limited in clinical therapy due to systemic toxicity, drug resistance, and low bioavailability. To meet this challenge, scientists have devoted continuous efforts to discover new candidate drugs and have developed drug strategies. This review focuses on the current clinical treatment of PTOXs and the prospective analysis for improving druggability in the rational design of new generation PTOX-derived drugs.;"https://doi.org/10.1039/d0np00041h; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32895676/";08/09/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9351
164;Lateralized Cerebral Processing of Abstract Linguistic Structure in Clear and Degraded Speech.;10.1093/cercor/bhaa245;"Human cortical activity measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to track the temporal regularity of linguistic information in connected speech. In the current study, we investigate the underlying neural sources of these responses and test the hypothesis that they can be directly modulated by changes in speech intelligibility. MEG responses were measured to natural and spectrally degraded (noise-vocoded) speech in 19 normal hearing participants. Results showed that cortical coherence to ""abstract"" linguistic units with no accompanying acoustic cues (phrases and sentences) were lateralized to the left hemisphere and changed parametrically with intelligibility of speech. In contrast, responses coherent to words/syllables accompanied by acoustic onsets were bilateral and insensitive to intelligibility changes. This dissociation suggests that cerebral responses to linguistic information are directly affected by intelligibility but also powerfully shaped by physical cues in speech. This explains why previous studies have reported widely inconsistent effects of speech intelligibility on cortical entrainment and, within a single experiment, provided clear support for conclusions about language lateralization derived from a large number of separately conducted neuroimaging studies. Since noise-vocoded speech resembles the signals provided by a cochlear implant device, the current methodology has potential clinical utility for assessment of cochlear implant performance.";"https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901245/";09/09/2020;magnetoencephalography;0.994

We describe the set-up of the VITOM® exoscope system based on our 5 years’ experience of using it as an effective intraoperative video imaging and teaching modality for extraocular surgery. METHODS: The VITOM® is a specially designed exoscope mounted onto a versatile mechanical arm. It is attached to a high definition (HD) digital camera displayed on the HD video monitor of a standard endoscopy stack. This technology has been utilised in other surgical subspecialties, but there is no documented use within extraocular surgery. RESULTS: The exoscope was simple to set-up and allowed real-time recording and editing with an HD image display system. The theatre team were able to view the precise surgical steps, contributing to improved theatre flow. Trainees reported that the VITOM® images significantly improved their visualisation and understanding of key surgical anatomy and steps. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience showed that the VITOM® exoscope is an excellent intraoperative video imaging and teaching aid, as it allows real-time capture and editing of open surgery and seems to improve theatre flow. With newer models using 3D stereoscopic vision, it could be further evaluated as a heads-up viewing system within extraocular and oculoplastic surgery.";"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-01355-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469130/";19/01/2021;Intraoperative imaging;0.9626

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the outcomes of the elderly compared to nonelderly undergoing CAWR using propensity score matching. METHODS: All patients who underwent CAWR using porcine-derived, non-crosslinked acellular dermal matrix (ADM) (Strattice™) between January 2014 and July 2017 were studied retrospectively. Propensity matched analysis was performed for risk adjustment in multivariable analysis and for one-to-one matching. The outcomes were analyzed for differences in postoperative complications, reoperations, mortality, hospital length of stay and adverse discharge disposition. RESULTS: One hundred-thirty-six patients were identified during the study period. Non-elderly (aged 18–64 years) constituted 70% (n = 95) and elderly (aged ≥ 65 years) comprised 30% of the overall patient population (n = 41). Seventy-three (56.7%) were females. After adjustment through the propensity score, which included 35 pairs, the surgical site infection (p = 1.000), wound necrosis (p = 1.000), the need for mechanical ventilation (p = 0.259), mortality (p = 0.083), reoperation rate (p = 0.141), hospital length of stay (p = 0.206), and discharge disposition (p = 0.795) were similar. CONCLUSION: Elderly patients undergoing CAWR with biological mesh have comparable outcomes with non-elderly patients when using propensity matching score.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223233/;24/01/2020;Complex abdominal wall reconstruction;0.9738
167;Clinical and laboratory characteristics in outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19 in healthcare professionals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.;10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206797;AIMS This study aimed to identify the symptoms associated with early stage SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infections in healthcare professionals (HCPs) using both clinical and laboratory data. METHODS A total of 1297 patients, admitted between 18 March and 8 April 2020, were stratified according to their risk of developing COVID-19 using their responses to a questionnaire designed to evaluate symptoms and risk conditions. RESULTS Anosmia/hyposmia (p<0.0001), fever (p<0.0001), body pain (p<0.0001) and chills (p=0.001) were all independent predictors for COVID-19, with a 72% estimated probability for detecting COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal swab samples. Leucopenia, relative monocytosis, decreased eosinophil values, C reactive protein (CRP) and platelets were also shown to be significant independent predictors for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The significant clinical features for COVID-19 were identified as anosmia, fever, chills and body pain. Elevated CRP, leucocytes under 5400×109/L and relative monocytosis (>9%) were common among patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. These variables may help, in the absence of reverse transcriptase PCR tests, to identify possible COVID-19 infections during pandemic outbreaks. SUMMARY From 19 March to 8 April 2020, 1297 patients attended the Polyclinic Piquet Carneiro for COVID-19 detection. HCP data were analysed, and significant clinical features were anosmia, fever, chills and body pain. Elevated CRP, leucopenia and monocytosis were common in COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33568424/";10/02/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.9555
168;Mental Models of Infectious Diseases and Public Understanding of COVID-19 Prevention.;10.1080/10410236.2020.1837462;The emergence of viral diseases such as Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed considerable challenges to health care systems around the world. Public health strategy to address emerging infectious diseases has depended in part on human behavior change and yet the perceptions and knowledge motivating that behavior have been at times inconsistent with the latest consensus of peer-reviewed science. Part of that disjuncture likely involves the existence and persistence of past ideas about other diseases. To forecast and prepare for future epidemic and pandemic response, we need to better understand how people approach emerging infectious diseases as objects of public opinion during the periods when such diseases first become salient at a population level. In this essay, we explore two examples of how existing mental models of past infectious diseases appear to have conditioned and constrained public response to novel viral diseases. We review previously reported experiences related to Zika virus in Central America and discuss public opinion data collected in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of Zika virus disease, we assess how thinking about earlier mosquito-borne disease seems to have affected public consideration of the virus in Guatemala. In the case of COVID-19, we assess how previous vaccination behavior for a different disease is associated with intention to obtain vaccination for COVID-19 in the future.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1837462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33081500/";21/10/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9553
169;Evidence-Based Approach to Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest;10.1007/s11936-021-00924-3;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death. Despite improvements in the cardiac disease management, OHCA outcomes remain poor. The purpose of this review is to provide information on the management of OHCA survivors, evidence-based treatments, and current gaps in the knowledge. RECENT FINDINGS: Most common cause of death from OHCA is neurological injury followed by shock and multiorgan failure. Prognostication tools are available to help with the clinical decision-making. Taking measures to improve EMS response time, encouraging bystander CPR, early defibrillation, and targeted temperature management are shown to improve survival. Early activation of cardiac catheterization lab for coronary angiography, hemodynamic assessment, and mechanical circulatory support should be considered in patients with shockable rhythm and presumed cardiac cause, those with ST elevation, ongoing ischemia, or evidence of hemodynamic and electrical instability. Randomized controlled trials are lacking in this field and benefits of interventions should be weighed against risk of pursuing a futile treatment. COVID-19 pandemic has added new challenges to the care of OHCA patients. SUMMARY: Clinical decision-making to care for OHCA patients is challenging. There is a need for trials to provide evidence-based knowledge on the care of OHCA patients.

170;Performance Assessment of Certain Machine Learning Models for Predicting the Major Depressive Disorder among IT Professionals during Pandemic times;10.1155/2021/9950332;Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mental disorder in the present day as all individuals' lives, irrespective of being employed or unemployed, is going through the depression phase at least once in their lifetime. In simple terms, it is a mood disturbance that can persist for an individual for more than a few weeks to months. In MDD, in most cases, the individuals do not consult a professional, and even if being consulted, the results are not significant as the individuals find it challenging to identify whether they are depressed or not. Depression, most of the time, cooccurs with anxiety and leads to suicide in few cases, among the employees, who are about to handle the pressure at work and home and mostly unnoticing such problems. This is why this work aims to analyze the IT employees who are mostly working with targets. The artificial neural network, which is modeled loosely like the brain, has proved in recent days that it can perform better than most of the classification algorithms. This study has implemented the multilayered neural perceptron and experimented with the backpropagation technique over the data samples collected from IT professionals. This study aims to develop a model that can classify depressed individuals from those who are not depressed effectively with the data collected from them manually and through sensors. The results show that deep-MLP with backpropagation outperforms other machine learning-based models for effective classification.;"https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9950332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995524/";27/04/2021;Major depressive disorder;0.9876

According to the results of scans of lung lesions via computed tomography (CT), the patients were divided into mild, moderate, and severe groups. The clinical data of the patients were collected, including age, gender, finger pulse oxygen pressure, ventricular rate, body temperature, etc. The correlation between the clinical indicators and the lesions of high-resolution CT (HRCT) and bronchiectasis was analyzed. Among the 115 patients, 82 had no bronchiectasis and 33 had bronchiectasis. The bronchodilation-prone layers mainly included the left and right lower lobe of the lung. The probability of branching in the inflamed area was greater than that in the noninflamed area in patients with COVID-19. There were significant differences in gender, CT lesion range, and number of incidents of bronchiectasis between noninflamed and inflamed areas (P < 0.05). Moreover, there were significant differences in age, total proportion of CT lesions, volume of CT lesions, and total number of patients with bronchiectasis among the three groups (P < 0.05). CT lesion range was positively correlated with the total number of patients with bronchiectasis and patient age (respectively, r = 0.186, P < 0.05; r = 0.029, P < 0.05). The lesion range in HRCT images of lungs in patients with COVID-19 is correlated with bronchodilation.

172;Shrm4 contributes to autophagy inhibition and neuroprotection following ischemic stroke by mediating GABAB receptor activation.;10.1096/fj.202000458rr;Acute ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries and the most common cause of disability in adults worldwide. Despite advances in the understanding of stroke pathophysiology, therapeutic options remain limited. In this study, we explored the interaction of Shrm4 and the metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (GABAB ) in ischemic stroke. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was induced by filament insertion in Shrm4+/+ and wild-type C57BL/6J mice, followed by reperfusion for up to 7 days. Baclofen was administered was used to activate GABAB in vivo during reperfusion. Neurological deficits, motor and memory functions, and infarct volume were determined in the various mouse groups. Furthermore, we also developed an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) cell model in primary neurons to test Shrm4/GABAB interactions in vitro. Shrm4 was observed to decrease infarct volume and neuronal cell loss in penumbra, and rescue neurological deficits in MCAO mice. Notably, Shrm4 also increased pole climbing speed, reduced foot faults, and increased escape latency in the Morris water maze test, while reducing neuron autophagy through an interaction with GABAB receptors. GABAB activation using baclofen further reduced OGD-induced neuron damage in culture and stroke outcomes of MCAO, relative to Shrm4 alone. Taken together, Shrm4-mediated GABAB activation confers neuroprotection by reducing neuronal autophagy in acute ischemic stroke.;"https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202000458rr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079458/";20/10/2020;oxygen-glucose deprivation;0.9174
173;Novel coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) associated sinus node dysfunction: a case series;10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa132;BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To date, there have not been reports of sinus node dysfunction (SND) associated with COVID-19. This case series describes clinical characteristics, potential mechanisms, and short-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients who experience de novo SND. CASE SUMMARY: We present two cases of new-onset SND in patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient 1 is a 70-year-old female with no major past medical history who was intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia and developed new-onset sinus bradycardia without a compensatory increase in heart rate in response to relative hypotension. Patient 2 is an 81-year-old male with a past medical history of an ascending aortic aneurysm, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnoea who required intubation for COVID-19-induced acute hypoxic respiratory failure and exhibited new-onset sinus bradycardia followed by numerous episodes of haemodynamically significant accelerated idioventricular rhythm. Two weeks following the onset of SND, both patients remain in sinus bradycardia. DISCUSSION: COVID-19-associated SND has not previously been described. The potential mechanisms for SND in patients with COVID-19 include myocardial inflammation or direct viral infiltration. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should be monitored closely for the development of bradyarrhythmia and haemodynamic instability.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33089039/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa132";08/05/2020;Novel coronavirus-19 disease;0.9466
174;Transcriptomic responses to drought stress among natural populations provide insights into local adaptation of weeping forsythia;10.1186/s12870-021-03075-6;BACKGROUND: Understanding the genetic mechanisms of local adaptation is an important emerging topic in molecular ecology and evolutionary biology. RESULTS: Here, we identify the physiological changes and differential expression of genes among different weeping forsythia populations under drought stress in common garden experiments. Physiological results showed that HBWZ might have higher drought tolerance among four populations. RNA-seq results showed that significant differential expression in the genes responding to the synthesis of flavonoids, aromatic substances, aromatic amino acids, oxidation–reduction process, and transmembrane transport occured among four populations. By further reanalysis of results of previous studies, sequence differentiation was found in the genes related to the synthesis of aromatic substances among different weeping forsythia populations. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study supports the hypothesis that the dual differentiation in gene efficiency and expression increases among populations in response to heterogeneous environments and is an important evolutionary process of local adaptation. Here, we proposed a new working model of local adaptation of weeping forsythia populations under different intensities of drought stress, which provides new insights for understanding the genetic mechanisms of local adaptation for non-model species.

175;Development of RNA-based assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples;10.1101/2020.06.30.172833;The ongoing spread of pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the lack of specific drugs or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, demands rapid diagnosis and management are crucial for controlling the outbreak in the community. Here we report the development of the first rapid-colorimetric assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in the human nasopharyngeal RNA sample in less than 30 minutes. We utilized a nanomaterial-based optical sensing platform to detect RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2, where the formation of oligo probe-target hybrid led to salt-induced aggregation and changes in gold-colloid color from pink to blue in visible range. Accordingly, we found a change in colloid color from pink to blue in assay containing nasopharyngeal RNA sample from the subject with clinically diagnosed COVID-19. The colloid retained pink color when the test includes samples from COVID-19 negative subjects or human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women. The results were validated using nasopharangeal RNA samples from suspected COVID-19 subjects (n=136). Using RT-PCR as gold standard, the assay was found to have 85.29% sensitivity and 94.12% specificity. The optimized method has detection limit as little as 0.5 ng of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Overall, the developed assay rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples in a cost-effective manner and would be useful in pandemic management by facilitating mass screening.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.30.172833;04/12/2020;pandemic coronavirus disease;0.9603
176;A.B.C. approach proposal for POCUS in COVID-19 critically ill patients.;10.11152/mu-2733;The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) since December 2019 forced Intensive Care Units to face high numbers of patients admitted simultaneously with limited resources. COVID-19 critically ill patients, especially those on mechanical ventilators, demand special attention as they can develop potential complications with critical hemodynamic and respiratory consequences. Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) might have important roles in assessing the critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patient. Mostly, lung ultrasound has been presented as having a role in diagnosis and monitoring, but airway examination and hemodynamic evaluation are of interest also. We propose an A.B.C. POCUS approach focusing on A-airway (orotracheal intubation), B-breathing (interstitial syn-dromes, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pneumonia), and C-circulation (cardiac function, pulmonary embolism, volume status, deep veins thrombosis). This A.B.C. approach has emerged during ICU care for 22 adult COVID-19 critically ill patients, along with the analysis of recent papers describing ultrasound in COVID-19 patients including the use of ultrasound that is currently applied in the management of the general critically ill population. This A.B.C- POCUS algorithm parallels the well-established clinical A.B.C. algorithms. There are few extensive ultrasonographic studies in COVID-19 critically ill patients up to now, but techniques extrapolated from non-COVID studies seem reasonable even though comparative studies are not available yet.;"https://doi.org/10.11152/mu-2733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245734/";24/11/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9861

Like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory virus infecting the lungs with fever, dry cough and acute pneumonia being the major symptoms. It infects the epithelial cells expressing Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is crucial for the viral entry. Based on evolving clinical evidence, it is now unfitting to label SARS-CoV-2 as just a respiratory virus, as lately there are various reports that substantiate its pathogenicity in other organs of the body, including brain. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and MERS along with possibilities of viral entry into central nervous system (CNS) tissues. The review provides detailed information about the virulence, epidemiology and insights into molecular pathways involved in the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, along with in-depth view of current concepts about the neurological significance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its neuropathological competence. The review also touches upon our current understanding of placental transmission of SARS-CoV-2, an important aspect of vertical transmission.

By January 2021, number of confirmed cumulative cases crossed ∼104 million worldwide. Till date, no effective treatment or drug is available for this virus. Availability of X-ray structures of SARS-CoV2 main protease (Mpro) provides the potential opportunity for structure-based drug designing. Here, we have made an attempt to do computational drug design by targeting main protease of SARS-CoV2. High-throughput virtual screening of million molecules and natural compounds databases were performed followed by docking. After that, the protein-ligand complexes were optimized and rescoring of binding energies were accomplished through molecular dynamics simulation and Molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area approaches, respectively. In addition, conformational effect of various ligands on protein was also examined through essential dynamics simulation. Three compounds namely ZINC14732869, ZINC19774413, and ZINC19774479 were finally filtered that displayed better binding affinities than N3 (known) inhibitor and formed conformationally stable complexes. Hence, the current study features the potential novel inhibitors against main protease of SARS-CoV2 which might provide an effective therapeutic strategy against COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AIM: The aim of the present systematic review of the literature is to assess the effect of mouth rinses with H(2)O(2) on dental plaque, gingival inflammation, and oral microorganisms. METHODS: Five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched with the following focused question: what is the effect of hydrogen peroxide, in comparison to chlorhexidine or to a placebo solution, in oral microbiota control, dental plaque, and gingival inflammatory outcomes? Two independent examiners retrieved the articles and evaluated the evidence. RESULTS: The majority of included studies were performed with 1.5% H(2)O(2). Results related to plaque accumulation generally demonstrate a slightly better effect of H(2)O(2) as compared to placebo mouth rinses, however with a lower performance as compared to chlorhexidine. In terms of gingival inflammation, H(2)O(2) performs better than placebo and more clearly demonstrates an anti-inflammation effect. No studies evaluated the effect of H(2)O(2) against viruses or fungi. In terms of bacteria, H(2)O(2) demonstrates an antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Rinsing with H(2)O(2) has the potential to affect plaque, gingivitis, and oral bacteria, as compared to placebo.

We present the case report of a five-year-old, otherwise healthy boy who presented to the emergency department (ED) for symptoms of acute encephalopathy. He was lethargic, having slurred speech, hallucinating, intermittently agitated, and had multiple episodes of urinating on himself. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, lumbar puncture, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were all normal. The urine drug screen was also negative. Two days after admission, a saliva toxicology screen was significant for a topiramate level of 3487.8 ng/ml, which he was not taking and which his mother admitted taking for weight loss.

In Pakistan, an unprecedented resurgence of COVID-19 has been observed, and the current count has reached over half a million, with more than 9 thousand deaths so far. Dreadfully, a variant of concern (VOC-202012/01), previously known as VUI-202012/01, was first identified in the United Kingdom (UK). As of 13 December, more than 1,100 cases of this variant contagion have been reported throughout the UK. Alarmingly, the health department in Sindh has confirmed that 12 samples of UK returnees have been tested for genotype, six of them observed positive, and three of these showed the COVID-19 variant in the early phase. As a low-income country, Pakistan, with impoverished medical facilities persistent, shortage of healthcare personnel, increasing medical costs, shortage of medical equipment, and severe financial woes, cannot cater to the re-epidemics of VOC-202012/01 if it occurs, then the health sector might collapse. The current pandemic has uncovered significant challenges and flaws in Pakistan's emergency and health processes concerning infectious disease prevention. Efficient government interventions and concrete actions must be taken to educate peoples and deal with their wrong perceptions.

183;Overloaded and at Work: Investigating the Effect of Cognitive Workload on Assembly Task Performance.;10.1177/0018720820929928;OBJECTIVE This study investigates the effect of cognitive overload on assembly task performance and muscle activity. BACKGROUND Understanding an operator's cognitive workload is an important component in assessing human-machine interaction. However, little evidence is available on the effect that cognitive overload has on task performance and muscle activity when completing manufacturing tasks. METHOD Twenty-two volunteers completed an assembly task while performing a secondary cognitive task with increasing levels of demand (n-back). Performance in the assembly task (completion times, accuracy), muscle activity recorded as integrated electromyography (EMG), and self-reported workload were measured. RESULTS Results show that the increasing cognitive demand imposed by the n-back task resulted in impaired assembly task performance, overall greater muscle activity, and higher self-reported workload. Relative to the control condition, performing the 2-back task resulted in longer assembly task completion times (+10 s on average) and greater integrated EMG for flexor carpi ulnaris, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and pectoralis major. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that working under high cognitive load not only results in greater muscle activity, but also affects assembly task completion times, which may have a direct effect on manufacturing cycle times.

184;Investigator initiated clinical trial of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in Japan.;10.35772/ghm.2020.01106;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China, has spread globally very rapidly. The number of COVID-19 patients increased in Japan from late March to early April 2020. Since COVID-19 treatment methods with antiviral drugs were not established in March 2020, clinical trials began at a rapid pace worldwide. We participated in a global investigator-initiated clinical trial of the antiviral drug remdesivir. It took approximately two months to prepare for and start patient enrollment, 26 days to enroll all patients in Japan, and 32 days from the end of enrollment to the release of the first report, a fairly quick response overall. In the course of this clinical trial, we found some of the critical issues related to conducting an infectious disease clinical trial in Japan need to be addressed and tackled to support a rapid response. These included such things as the necessity of a research network to promote clinical research, a framework for a rapid review system of clinical trial notification, and better cooperation with outsourced teams. Furthermore, for Japan to take the lead in global collaborative research and development in the field of infectious diseases, it is necessary to develop further human resources and organization on a national basis. It is indispensable for Japan to establish a clinical trial system at the national level to prepare for future emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.;"https://doi.org/10.35772/ghm.2020.01106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937567/";30/04/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9871
185;Lifelong Clinical Impact of the Presence of Sarcomere Gene Mutation in Japanese Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.;10.1253/circj.cj-20-0027;BACKGROUND Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is mainly caused by mutations in sarcomere genes. Regarding the clinical implications of genetic information, little is known about the lifelong clinical effect of sarcomere mutations in Japanese HCM patients.Methods and Results:We studied 211 consecutive Japanese patients with HCM who had agreed to genetic testing between 2003 and 2013. Genetic analyses were performed by direct DNA sequencing in the 6 common sarcomere genes (MYH7,MYBPC3,TNNT2,TNNI3,TPM1,ACTC). Through variant filtering, 21 mutations were identified in 67 patients. After excluding 8 patients whose variants were determined as having uncertain significance, finally 203 patients (130 men, age at study entry: 61.8±14.1 years) were investigated for clinical presentation and course. At the time of study entry, patients with mutations were younger, had more frequent non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, had greater interventricular wall thickness, were more frequently in the dilated phase and less frequently had apical HCM. Through their lifetimes, a total of 98 HCM-related morbid events occurred in 72 patients. Survival analysis revealed that patients with sarcomere gene mutations experienced those morbid events significantly more frequently, and this tendency was more prominent for lethal arrhythmic events. CONCLUSIONS In our HCM cohort, patients with sarcomere gene mutations had poorer lifelong outcome. Genetic information is considered important for better management of HCM.;"https://doi.org/10.1253/circj.cj-20-0027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830170/";22/08/2020;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy;0.9139

Little is known about the disease burden in Laos. We aimed to evaluate the burden and outcomes of AKI as well as assess the availability of AKI treatment in Laos. METHODS: We performed a multicentric prospective observational study in adult patients who had been admitted to 5 intensive care units (ICU) in Laos. The data was serially collected on the first 28 days of ICU admission. Patients were diagnosed by the KDIGO 2012 criteria for AKI. We used AKI occurrence as the primary outcome and explored risk factors on the development and outcomes of AKI. RESULTS: We enrolled 1480 patients from 5 ICU centers across Laos from January to December 2016. After excluding patients with end-stage renal disease and those with incomplete data, AKI occurred in 508 of the 1460 enrolled patients (34.8%). Overall, the rates of maximum AKI staging were 4% for stage 1, 10.3% for stage 2, and 20.5% for stage 3. Risk factors for AKI were older age, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, renal diseases, oncologic diseases, and chronic kidney diseases. Only 1.8% of all participants received RRT. The mortality rate was 28.4% in non-AKI patients compared to 44.5% in AKI patients, which increased according to the stage of AKI (stage 1, 4.9%; stage 2, 28.3%; stage 3 66.8%; P < 0.001). There were 13.6% who were discharged against medical advice. CONCLUSIONS: AKI is a huge burden in Laos with under-recognition and poor outcomes.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358323/;14/07/2020;Acute kidney injury;0.9068
187;The challenge of avidity determination in SARS‐CoV‐2 serology;10.1002/jmv.26863;The serological responses towards severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) nucleoprotein, receptor‐binding domain (RBD), and spike protein S1 are characterized by incomplete avidity maturation. Analysis with varying concentrations of urea allows to determine distinct differences in avidity maturation, though the total process remains at an unusually low level. Despite incomplete avidity maturation, this approach allows to define early and late stages of infection. It therefore can compensate for the recently described irregular kinetic patterns of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed towards SARS‐CoV‐2 antigens. The serological responses towards seasonal coronaviruses neither have a negative nor positive impact on SARS‐CoV‐2 serology in general. Avidity determination in combination with measurement of antibody titers and complexity of the immune response allows to clearly differentiate between IgG responses towards seasonal coronaviruses and SARS‐CoV‐2. Cross‐reactions seem to occur with very low probability. They can be recognized by their pattern of response and through differential treatment with urea. As high avidity has been shown to be essential in several virus systems for the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies, it should be clarified whether high avidity of IgG directed towards RBD indicates protective immunity. If this is the case, monitoring of avidity should be part of the optimization of vaccination programs.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33565617/";19/02/2021;receptor‐binding domain;0.9936

In November 2019, the UK Disasters Research Group (DRG) brought together a number of key stakeholders focused on disaster risk, resilience, and sustainability research relevant to Official Development Assistance to consider how fit for purpose existing partnership models are for the pace of change required to deliver the priorities of the wider 2030 Agenda. Participants were invited to discuss how research partnerships across three levels (individual and project-based; national and institutional; and international) could be improved based on elements that facilitate robust partnerships and learning from aspects that hinder them. From the discussions, participants emphasized the importance of effective communication mechanisms in building partnerships, co-designing projects, and establishing shared objectives.

189;Neonatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia: case report of kabuki syndrome due to a novel KMT2D splicing-site mutation;10.1186/s13052-020-00902-8;BACKGROUND: Persistent neonatal hypoglycemia, owing to the possibility of severe neurodevelopmental consequences, is a leading cause of neonatal care admission. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is often resistant to dextrose infusion and needs rapid diagnosis and treatment. Several congenital conditions, from single gene defects to genetic syndromes should be considered in the diagnostic approach. Kabuki syndrome type 1 (MIM# 147920) and Kabuki syndrome type 2 (MIM# 300867), can be associated with neonatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. PATIENT PRESENTATION: We report a female Italian (Sicilian) child, born preterm at 35 weeks gestation, with persistent hypoglycemia. Peculiar facial dysmorphisms, neonatal hypotonia, and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia raised suspicion of Kabuki syndrome. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was confirmed with glucagon test and whole-exome sequencing (WES) found a novel heterozygous splicing-site mutation (c.674-1G > A) in KMT2D gene. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was successfully treated with diazoxide. At 3 months corrected age for prematurity, a mild global neurodevelopmental delay, postnatal weight and occipitofrontal circumference growth failure were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Kabuki syndrome should be considered when facing neonatal persistent hypoglycemia. Diazoxide may help to improve hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. A multidisciplinary and individualized follow-up should be carried out for early diagnosis and treatment of severe pathological associated conditions.;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-020-00902-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32948218/";18/09/2020;Persistent neonatal hypoglycemia;0.9624
190;The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2;10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z;The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic. The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This will improve our understanding of virus–host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123347/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z";02/03/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9439

A descriptive epidemiological study was conducted using data on the number of deaths by suicide published by the National Police Agency. The suicide rate ratio during the crisis-the monthly suicide mortality rate in the year of the crisis divided by the average suicide mortality rate in the three years before the crisis-was used as the indicator. After the earthquake, in March 2011 the suicide rate was 18% lower than the average mortality rate for the previous three years. However, it increased by 18% in May and 8% in June; increased mortality was observed among women. The suicide rate began to decline after October 2011. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the suicide rate decreased from February to June 2020. The declines in April and May were significant at 20% and 18%, respectively. From July onwards, the suicide rate of women began to rise, and from October, the overall suicide also began to increase. The rise in female suicide rates was significant, especially in October, with an increase of 70%. Thus, during these crises, suicide rates fell temporarily but then rose, especially among women. The period of increase in suicide rates was longer during the COVID-19 pandemic than after the earthquake.

METHODS: Children with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in 11 hospitals from three provinces of South China were included in the study. Clinical information was collected and compared with children and adults infected by SARS‐CoV‐2 in Wuhan. RESULTS: In total, 52 children were enrolled, including 28 boys. The median age was 9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4‐12); 44.2% cases were of clustered occurrences, 40.4% patients had fever, 48.1% had cough, and 46.2% had a high lymphocyte count. No abnormalities were found in the liver and kidney function. Also, 82.7% of patients received antiviral therapy, but such therapy did not shorten the time to virus negativity or hospital stay (P = .082). The time to virus negativity was 12.0 days (IQR, 8.0‐16.8) and hospital stay was 14.5 days (IQR, 10.3‐17.9). Compared with reports in Wuhan, there were more acute upper respiratory tract infection (AURTI) and fewer pneumonia cases (P = .000). Compared with the non‐ICU adult COVID‐19 in Wuhan, these children's diseases were relatively mild, with fewer complications.

194;Translation and cultural adaptation of IPOS (integrated palliative care outcome scale) in Estonia;10.1186/s41687-021-00288-z;BACKGROUND: Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are questionnaires that could be used in palliative care (PC) to evaluate patient well-being and monitor their care. PROMs enable a focus on what is important to patients by putting the patient at the center of care. Adapting an existing PROM requires considering cultural differences, general usability and understandability of translated terms. AIM: To translate and culturally adapt both the patient and staff three and seven day versions of the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS) into Estonian. The IPOS consist of 10 questions (staff versions 9 questions) and 17 close ended items. The sub aim is to describe the differences and discrepancies found during the adaptation process and compare the results with previous research. METHODS: The translation and adaptation process of IPOS was conducted using recommended guidelines consisting of six phases and included cognitive interviews with patients (n = 11) and palliative care multidisciplinary team members (n = 8). The study was conducted in two major Estonian hospitals. RESULTS: The Estonian IPOS demonstrated face and content validity, acceptance by patients and staff. As a result of expert group review and cognitive interviews with patients and staff, 9 semantic changes were implemented. CONCLUSIONS: Patient and staff versions of the IPOS with a recall of 3 or 7 days were translated and culturally adapted for Estonia.

Results from a single Italian centre.;10.1530/eje-20-0541;"Objective Specific comorbidities and old age create a greater vulnerability to severe Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). While obesity seems to aggravate the course of disease, the actual impact of the body mass index (BMI) and the cutoff which increases illness severity are still under investigation. The aim of the study was to analyze whether the BMI represented a risk factor f qor respiratory failure, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death. Research Design and Methods A retrospective cohort study of 482 consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalised between March 1 and April 20, 2020. Logistic regression analysis and Cox proportion Hazard models including demographic characteristics and comorbidities were carried out to predict the endpoints within 30 days from the onset of symptoms. Results Of 482 patients, 104 (21.6%) had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. At logistic regression analysis, a BMI between 30 and 34.9 kg/m2 significantly increased the risk of respiratory failure (OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.31-4.09, p=0.004), and admission to the ICU (OR: 4.96; 95% CI: 2.53-9.74, p<0.001). A significantly higher risk of death was observed in patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (OR: 12.1; 95% CI: 3.25-45.1, p<0.001). Conclusions Obesity is a strong, independent risk factor for respiratory failure, admission to the ICU and death among COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVE The objective of the present study was to compare coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms and outcomes in centenarians and other residents living in nursing homes. Design-Setting-Subjects-Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted using data from 15 nursing homes in the Marseille area. Older residents with confirmed COVID-19 between March and June 2020 were enrolled. The clinical and biological characteristics, the treatment measures, and the outcomes in residents living in these nursing homes were collected from the medical records. RESULTS A total of 321 residents were diagnosed with COVID-19 including 12 centenarians. The median age was 101 years in centenarians and 89 years in other residents. The most common symptoms were asthenia and fever. Three centenarians (25%) experienced a worsening of pre-existing depression (vs. 5.5% of younger residents; p = 0.032). Mortality was significantly higher in centenarians than in younger residents (50% vs. 21.3%, respectively; p = 0.031). A quarter of the younger residents and only one centenarian were hospitalized.

To examine the quality of such data, we chose to replicate lexical decision and item recognition paradigms from Ratcliff et al. (Cognitive Psychology, 60, 127-157, 2010) and numerosity discrimination paradigms from Ratcliff and McKoon (Psychological Review, 125, 183-217, 2018) with subjects recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Along with these tasks, we collected data from either an IQ test or a math computation test. Subjects in the lexical decision and item recognition tasks were relatively well-behaved, with only a few giving a significant number of responses with response times (RTs) under 300 ms at chance accuracy, i.e., fast guesses, and a few with unstable RTs across a session. But in the numerosity discrimination tasks, almost half of the subjects gave a significant number of fast guesses and/or unstable RTs across the session. Diffusion model parameters were largely consistent with the earlier studies as were correlations across tasks and correlations with IQ and age. One surprising result was that eliminating fast outliers from subjects with highly variable RTs (those eliminated from the main analyses) produced diffusion model analyses that showed patterns of correlations similar to the subjects with stable performance. Methods for displaying data to examine stability, eliminating subjects, and implementing RT data collection on AMT including checks on timing are also discussed.;"https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01573-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33825128/";06/04/2021;Online data collection;0.9193
199;Disparities In Outcomes Among COVID-19 Patients In A Large Health Care System In California.;10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598;As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic spreads throughout the United States, evidence is mounting that racial and ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are bearing a disproportionate burden of illness and death. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 patients at Sutter Health, a large integrated health care system in northern California, to measure potential disparities. We used Sutter's integrated electronic health record to identify adults with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, and used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk of hospitalization, adjusting for known risk factors, such as race/ethnicity, sex, age, health, and socioeconomic variables. We analyzed 1,052 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 1-April 8, 2020. Among our findings, we observed that, compared with non-Hispanic white patients, African Americans had 2.7 times the odds of hospitalization, after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and income. We explore possible explanations for this, including societal factors that either result in barriers to timely access to care or create circumstances in which patients view delaying care as the most sensible option. Our study provides real-world evidence that there are racial and ethnic disparities in the presentation of COVID-19.

Material and methods: a systematic review a comprehensive literature search in Global Health, SCOPUS, Medline and EMBASE was performed using relevant keywords and medical descriptors (MeSH) related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and prisons. National and international recommendations and guides were examined as well as documents published by some countries. Results: the key points of the guides are discussed. The vast majority of recommendations coincide with respect to the measures and procedures that should be used, except for some discrepancy regarding the population screening. Until now, most industrialized countries (except the US and some specific scenarios) have controlled successfully the epidemic in prisons. Less data is found as regards to socioeconomically more disadvantaged countries. Conclusions: prisons are prone to a high risk of SARS-cOv-2 transmission due to their space limitations and sometimes poor environmental and hygienic conditions. The recommendations of the control and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection must be the same as those outside the prison, but must be adapted to the peculiarities of the prison. The recommendations must be issued by the health administration in coordination with the prison administration.

202;A Culture-Centered Approach to Experiences of the Coronavirus Pandemic Lockdown Among Internal Migrants in India;10.1177/00027642211000392;India’s coronavirus lockdown forced low-wage migrant workers to return from the city to the home towns and villages from which they came. Pre-pandemic living and working conditions were already stressful and difficult for these migrants. The lockdown became an additional burden, since it shut down sources of income with no assurance about when, or if, work and earning to support families could be resumed. This article draws on the lens of the Culture-Centered Approach (CCA) to understand how workers engaged with and navigated these difficult times. A total of 54 migrant workers locked-down at home across the Indian states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal were interviewed for this qualitative study. Financial worries were found to be endemic, with rising debt a major source of stress, and educational qualifications becoming an obstacle to earning. Returning migrants were suspected of bringing the virus from the city, and so stigmatized in their home towns and villages. However, the pandemic lockdown also showed some unexpected healthful consequences. It provided these marginalized, and always busy workers the time and space to stop working for a while, to stay home, eat home food, and take walks in the comparatively green and clean spaces of their home environments. In this, the pandemic lockdown may be seen to have enabled a measure of agency and health in the lives of these workers, an oasis albeit temporary, and ultimately subject to the demands of the globalized cities of India.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7969851/;17/03/2021;Culture-Centered Approach;0.9675
203;A Summary of the SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines and Technologies Available or under Development.;10.3390/pathogens10070788;Since the beginning of 2020, the world has been in a race to develop vaccines that can control the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 250 projects have been initiated for this purpose, but only 14 of them have been authorized for use, despite being in phase 3 clinical trials. More than 40 other vaccines are also in phase 1/2 clinical trials and show promising outcomes. Regarding the appropriate choice of vaccines for each country or region, we reviewed the currently used vaccines in light of the different influencing parameters. These factors include the mode of action, dosage protocol, age group of the vaccinee, side effects, storage conditions, mounted immune response, and cost. Technically, there are seven types of vaccines developed against SARS-CoV-2: messenger RNA (mRNA), nonreplicating and replicating vectors, inactivated viruses, protein subunits, viral-like particles, DNA vaccines, and live attenuated vaccines. The mRNA type is being used for the first time in humans. Unfortunately, mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2 have started to appear worldwide, and researchers are investigating the effects of the currently used vaccines on them. There are many concerns regarding the long-term protection afforded by these vaccines and their side effects, and whether they require future modifications to be effective against the mutated variants. The development of new vaccines using more advanced technology is paramount for overcoming the difficulties in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic across the world.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10070788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206507/";22/06/2021;vaccines;0.9156
204;Molecular profiling and anti-infective potency of endophytic actinomycetes inhabiting Madhuca insignis Radlk., from Western Ghats of India;10.1186/s43141-021-00135-0;BACKGROUND: Endophytic actinomycetes are well known for their diverse bioactive entities and considered as an important source for drug development research. RESULTS: We isolated and identified four potential endophytic Streptomyces species, i.e., Streptomyces misionensis MI22, Streptomyces roietensis MI24, Streptomyces glaucescens MI29, and Streptomyces sp. MI04 inhabiting Madhuca insignis by its characteristic morphological features and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. S. misionensis MI22 exhibits a broad spectrum of anti-microbial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (25.00 ± 1.00 mm) followed by Bacillus subtilis (23.66 ± 0.57 mm), Escherichia coli (22.00 ± 0.00 mm), and Candida albicans (18.00 ± 0.00 mm). Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the ethyl acetate fraction of S. misionensis MI22 against test pathogens were ranged from 25 to 100 μg/mL. Indeed, strain MI22 also exhibited significant anti-proliferative activity against HeLa cell line with IC(50) value 98 μg/mL and showed no cytotoxicity effect to the normal human embryonic kidney cell line in the MTT assay. The anti-microbial metabolites from strain MI22 were detected at R(f) 0.55 as depicted by the inhibition zone on the intensive band in TLC-bioautography assay. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that, anti-microbial metabolites of these endophytic Streptomyces species, especially S. misionensis MI22 as a prolific source to discover novel bioactive metabolites to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33625604/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s43141-021-00135-0";24/02/2021;Endophytic actinomycetes;0.9452
205;Mathematical models for devising the optimal SARS-CoV-2 strategy for eradication in China, South Korea, and Italy;10.1186/s12967-020-02513-7;BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spreads rapidly and has attracted worldwide attention. METHODS: To improve the forecast accuracy and investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, we constructed four mathematical models to numerically estimate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the efficacy of eradication strategies. RESULTS: Using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, and including measures such as city closures and extended leave policies implemented by the Chinese government that effectively reduced the β value, we estimated that the β value and basic transmission number, R(0), of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.476/6.66 in Wuhan, 0.359/5.03 in Korea, and 0.400/5.60 in Italy. Considering medicine and vaccines, an advanced model demonstrated that the emergence of vaccines would greatly slow the spread of the virus. Our model predicted that 100,000 people would become infected assuming that the isolation rate α in Wuhan was 0.30. If quarantine measures were taken from March 10, 2020, and the quarantine rate of α was also 0.3, then the final number of infected people was predicted to be 11,426 in South Korea and 147,142 in Italy. CONCLUSIONS: Our mathematical models indicate that SARS-CoV-2 eradication depends on systematic planning, effective hospital isolation, and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and some measures including city closures and leave policies should be implemented to ensure SARS-CoV-2 eradication.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32891155/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02513-7";05/09/2020;Coronavirus disease 2019;0.9016
206;Evidence Regarding Rapid Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy in Patients Living with HIV;10.1007/s11908-021-00750-5;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is increasingly more common among clinics serving people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH). It is recommended by major guidelines and is especially important in achieving the Getting to Zero (GTZ) goals by 2030. Patients should be offered the option to initiate ART as soon as possible, preferably at time of HIV diagnosis, with the goal of reducing transmission, morbidity, and mortality. RECENT FINDINGS: Three published randomized controlled trials, and several other observational, prospective, and retrospective studies, demonstrated superior rates of viral suppression (VS) with initiation of rapid ART compared to standard of care. Improved time to VS and retention in care were also observed. Based on the regimens studied, a tenofovir backbone combined with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor or protease inhibitor is recommended for rapid start initiation. Since ART is started earlier compared with standard of care, there is opportunity to achieve VS at a much faster rate, especially in the setting of starting on the day of diagnosis. What requires further evaluation is whether or not VS is sustained over time with quicker linkage and initiation of HIV care. SUMMARY: Initiating rapid ART in newly diagnosed PLWH provides a promising approach to achieving GTZ. When offered rapid ART, virologic suppression is improved compared to standard of care, which may reduce transmission and, ultimately, new HIV infections.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-021-00750-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824625/";02/04/2021;Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy;0.9056
207;Centenarians in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic;10.18632/aging.202743;"Background: Centenarians are known to be successful agers compared to other older adults.Objective: The objective of the present study was to compare coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms and outcomes in centenarians and other residents living in nursing homes. Design-Setting-Subjects-Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted using data from 15 nursing homes in the Marseille area. Older residents with confirmed COVID-19 between March and June 2020 were enrolled. The clinical and biological characteristics, the treatment measures, and the outcomes in residents living in these nursing homes were collected from the medical records. Results: A total of 321 residents were diagnosed with COVID-19 including 12 centenarians. The median age was 101 years in centenarians and 89 years in other residents. The most common symptoms were asthenia and fever. Three centenarians (25%) experienced a worsening of pre-existing depression (vs. 5.5% of younger residents; p = 0.032). Mortality was significantly higher in centenarians than in younger residents (50% vs. 21.3%, respectively; p = 0.031). A quarter of the younger residents and only one centenarian were hospitalized. However, 33.3% of the centenarians received treatment within the context of home hospitalization. Conclusion: Worsening of pre-existing depression seems to be more frequent in centenarians with COVID-19 in nursing homes. This population had a higher mortality rate but a lower hospitalization rate than younger residents.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993710/;02/03/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9726
208;Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Integrated Reporting;10.1007/978-3-030-62501-6_14;Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and sustainable development address the relationship between business and society. In the 1980s, the Brundtland Report by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, Our common future (Burdtland Report). Retrieved from https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/5987our-common-future.pdf, 1987) coined the term sustainable development and its principle of sustainability for economic prosperity. These were reinforced by the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the blueprint for a more sustainable future. In parallel, CSR has received increased attention in practice and in theory, and has been defined by the European Commission as “the responsibility of enterprises for their impacts on society” (A renewed European Union Strategy 2011–2014 for Corporate Social Responsibility, 2011, p. 6). Calls for CSR have been framed through a mix of voluntary and law mandated corporate actions which have led to conflicting results. In a twenty-first century bedevilled by challenges and macro systems’ disruptions (e.g. social institutions, natural resources and technologies), environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors represent risks and opportunities that are strategically relevant and increasingly inform how businesses are run and investment decisions made. To reach their full potential, ESG need to be measured, included in managerial and investment decision-making and accounted for in integrated reporting.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980982/;16/10/2020;Corporate Social Responsibility;0.9735
209;The Risk and Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Immunosuppressed Patients: Cancer, HIV, and Solid Organ Transplant Recipients.;10.24875/aidsrev.20000052;"Toward the end of the year 2019, there was the eruption of an acute respiratory syndrome, which is widely referred as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from Wuhan, Hubei Province. The disease causes a range of respiratory illnesses, which are fatal. The COVID-19 disease has spread globally and has significantly impacted the health delivery systems, travel regulations, and economic activities and has posed and upsurge of responsibilities for the frontline healthcare workers. Due to the nature of the COVID-19 disease, it has typically caused complications which include pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction together with renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of date, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 though there are ongoing research studies to formulate a treatment. COVID-19 is highly contagious, and the risk of infection is higher for patients with immunesuppressed patients than regular patients. The immunesuppressed conditions include cancer, HIV, and patients with solid organ transplants (SOT). This paper aims to review the risk and impact of COVID-19 on immunesuppressed patients, with a focus on cancer, HIV, and patients with SOT and the essence of special parameters for their care and management. Despite the fatal effects of this global pandemic, the findings of this study indicate the high risk which immunosuppressed patients have to contract the disease; thus, the governments and health delivery systems have to offer them extra support and treatment.";"https://doi.org/10.24875/aidsrev.20000052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33118527/";01/01/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9754
210;Serum KL‐6 concentrations as a novel biomarker of severe COVID‐19;10.1002/jmv.26087;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2–induced direct cytopathic effects against type I and II pneumocytes mediate lung damage. Krebs von den Lungen‐6 (KL‐6) is mainly produced by damaged or regenerating alveolar type II pneumocytes. This preliminary study analyzed serum concentrations of KL‐6 in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) to verify its potential as a prognostic biomarker of severity. Twenty‐two patients (median age [interquartile range] 63 [59‐68] years, 16 males) with COVID‐19 were enrolled prospectively. Patients were divided into mild‐moderate and severe groups, according to respiratory impairment and clinical management. KL‐6 serum concentrations and lymphocyte subset were obtained. Peripheral natural killer (NK) cells/µL were significantly higher in nonsevere patients than in the severe group (P = .0449) and the best cut‐off value was 119 cells/µL. KL‐6 serum concentrations were significantly higher in severe patients than the nonsevere group (P = .0118). Receiver operating characteristic analysis distinguished severe and nonsevere patients according to KL‐6 serum levels and the best cut‐off value was 406.5 U/mL. NK cell analysis and assay of KL‐6 in serum can help identify severe COVID‐19 patients. Increased KL‐6 serum concentrations were observed in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, revealing a prognostic value and supporting the potential usefulness of KL‐6 measurement to evaluate COVID‐19 patients' prognosis.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32470148/";09/06/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9661
211;Assessing the Outbreak Risk of Epidemics Using Fuzzy Evidential Reasoning.;10.1111/risa.13730;Epidemic diseases (EDs) present a significant but challenging risk endangering public health, evidenced by the outbreak of COVID-19. Compared to other risks affecting public health such as flooding, EDs attract little attention in terms of risk assessment in the current literature. It does not well respond to the high practical demand for advanced techniques capable of tackling ED risks. To bridge this gap, an adapted fuzzy evidence reasoning method is proposed to realize the quantitative analysis of ED outbreak risk assessment (EDRA) with high uncertainty in risk data. The novelty of this article lies in (1) taking the lead to establish the outbreak risk evaluation system of epidemics covering the whole epidemic developing process, (2) combining quantitative and qualitative analysis in the fields of epidemic risk evaluation, (3) collecting substantial first-hand data by reviewing transaction data and interviewing the frontier experts and policymakers from Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Chinese National Medical Products Administration. This work provides useful insights for the regulatory bodies to (1) understand the risk levels of different EDs in a quantitative manner and (2) the sensitivity of different EDs to the identified risk factors for their effective control. For instance, in the case study, we use real data to disclose that influenza has the highest breakout risk level in Beijing. The proposed method also provides a potential tool for evaluating the outbreak risk of COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33864640/";17/04/2021;Epidemic diseases;0.9001
212;Survey on perceived work stress and its influencing factors among hospital staff during the COVID‐19 pandemic in Taiwan;10.1002/kjm2.12294;This study aimed to investigate the perceived work stress and its influencing factors among hospital staff during the novel coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic in Taiwan. A web‐based survey was conducted at one medical center and two regional hospitals in southern Taiwan, targeting physicians, nurses, medical examiners, and administrators. The questionnaire included items on the demographic characteristics of hospital staff and a scale to assess stress among healthcare workers caring for patients with a highly infectious disease. A total of 752 valid questionnaires were collected. The hospital staff reported a moderate level of stress and nurses had a highest level of stress compared to staff in the other three occupational categories. The five highest stress scores were observed for the items “rough and cracked hands due to frequent hand washing and disinfectant use,” “inconvenience in using the toilet at work,” “restrictions on eating and drinking at work,” “fear of transmitting the disease to relatives and friends,” and “fear of being infected with COVID‐19.” Discomfort caused by protective equipment was the major stressor for the participants, followed by burden of caring for patients. Among participants who experienced severe stress (n = 129), work stress was higher among those with rather than without minor children. The present findings may serve as a reference for future monitoring of hospital staff's workload, and may aid the provision of support and interventions.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815248/; https://doi.org/10.1002/kjm2.12294";19/08/2020;coronavirus;0.9974
213;Integrated Proteomics and Bioinformatics to Identify Potential Prognostic Biomarkers in Hepatocellular Carcinoma;10.2147/cmar.s291811;BACKGROUND: Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of death by cancer and has a high mortality world-widely. Approximately 75–85% of primary liver cancers are caused by HCC. Uncovering novel genes with prognostic significance would shed light on improving the HCC patient’s outcome. OBJECTIVE: In this research, we aim to identify novel prognostic biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: Integrated proteomics and bioinformatics analysis were performed to investigate the expression landscape of prognostic biomarkers in 24 paired HCC patients. RESULTS: As a result, eight key genes related to prognosis, including ACADS, HSD17B13, PON3, AMDHD1, CYP2C8, CYP4A11, SLC27A5, CYP2E1, were identified by comparing the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), proteomic differentially expressed genes (DEGs), proteomic turquoise module, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort DEGs of HCC. Furthermore, we trained and validated eight pivotal genes integrating these independent clinical variables into a nomogram with superior accuracy in predicting progression events, and their lower expression was associated with a higher stage/risk score. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) further revealed that these key genes showed enrichment in the HCC regulatory pathway. CONCLUSION: All in all, we found that these eight genes might be the novel potential prognostic biomarkers for HCC and also provide promising insights into the pathogenesis of HCC at the molecular level.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7959210/;11/03/2021;Liver hepatocellular carcinoma;0.934

By March 18th , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 had spread to all 50 US states, with 7,038 cases and 97 deaths.1 The trajectory of cases mirrors that of Italy, where doctors are forced to consider who is more deserving of a ventilator.2 In response, social distancing measures are being promoted across the US in the hopes of slowing the growth in new cases, i.e. ""flattening the curve."" This could maintain the demand for acute care within the healthcare system's capacity to treat.3 Travel has been curtailed, conferences and concerts cancelled, and schools and universities have moved students off campus and classes online. Medical schools are following suit, with added motivators. In canceling classes and rotations, medical schools hope to: promote social distancing, limit the risk of students contracting the virus, limit the number of healthcare workers who might spread the virus to unaffected patients, minimize the teaching burden on frontline providers, and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE) for essential personnel. These are logical reasons for removing students from hospitals. But, despite our best efforts, there may come a point in the US when, as is set to happen in Italy, medical demand outpaces medical capacity.2 If the same happens here, is there a plan in place for incorporating senior medical students into emergency relief efforts?";"https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.13972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215977/";13/04/2020;coronavirus;0.9059
215;Using Historical Scientific Controversies to Promote Undergraduates’ Argumentation;10.1007/s11191-020-00126-6;The Covid-19 pandemic is the reason why humanity is paying more attention to the importance of regular and rigorous handwashing. Interestingly, in the nineteenth century, regular and rigorous handwashing was a key (and controversial) solution proposed by the Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis to cut drastically cases of puerperal fever. The purpose of this study was to provide evidence that the case of Semmelweis and puerperal fever—a crucial historical scientific controversy—can be used as a springboard to promote university student argumentation. Our study was inspired by the fact that the Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development (OECD) stressed that more efforts and resources should be invested in promoting argumentation as an essential component for scientifically literate citizens in twenty-first century societies. However, nowadays, argument and debate are virtually absent from university science education. The data was derived from 124 undergraduates’ (64 females and 60 males, 15–30 years old) written responses and audio and video recordings in a university biology course in Colombia. The findings show that the articulation of this historical controversy with decision-making, small-group debate, and whole-class debate activities can be useful for promoting undergraduates’ argumentation. This study contributes to the development of a research-based university science education that can inform the design of an argumentation curriculum for higher education.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836875/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-020-00126-6";27/05/2020;Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development;0.9598

This qualitative study describes how stakeholders contributed to the design, conduct, and dissemination of findings of a multisite pragmatic clinical trial, the COMprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services (COMPASS) Study. We engaged stakeholders as integral research partners by embedding them in study committees and community resource networks that supported local sites. Data stemmed from formal focus groups and continuous participation in working groups. Guided by Grounded Theory, we extracted themes from focus group and meeting notes. These were discussed as a team and with other stakeholder groups for feasibility. A consensus approach was used. Stakeholder input changed many aspects of the study including: the care model that treated stroke as a chronic condition after hospital discharge, training for hospital-based providers who often lacked awareness of the barriers to recovery that patients face, support for caregivers who were essential for stroke patients' recovery, and for community-based health and social service providers whose services can support recovery yet often go underutilized. Stakeholders brought value to both pragmatic research and health service delivery.

Children were reported to manifest mild to moderate symptoms and mortality was primarily observed in patients aged <1 year and having underlying comorbidities. The majority of the cases were asymptomatic in children, hence, posing a challenge for pediatric surgery centers to take drastic measures to reduce the virus transmission. Telemedicine was introduced and outpatient consultations were conducted online as out-patient clinics were closed. Elective surgeries were postponed with delayed appointments while the healthcare sector was diverted towards tackling COVID-19. Case urgency was classified and triaged, leading to limited surgeries being performed only in COVID-19 negative patients following an extensive screening process. The screening process consisted of online history taking and RT-PCR tests. Newer practices such as mouth rinse, video laryngoscopy, and anesthesia were introduced to restrict patients from crying, coughing, and sneezing, as an attempt to avoid aerosolization of viral particles and safely conduct pediatric surgeries during the pandemic. Surgical trainees were also affected as the smaller number of surgeries conducted reduced the clinical experience available to medical enthusiasts.

This study analyzed the COVID-19 deferrals of blood volunteers and compared the demographics, deferrals, and the donor status during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected from the integrated blood donor database between Feb-Apr 2019 and 2020. Deferral reasons of COVID-19 were categorized as: those who have symptoms or live with a symptomatic family member, have direct exposure with a confirmed case, have travelled from the outbreak affected areas, and have fully recovered from confirmed COVID-19. The z-test analysis was used, and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated to compare the sample proportions. RESULTS: The blood donations dropped to 26.09 % in 2020. The percent change of first-time blood donors, female donors, and donors within the age group of 45−54 years old was significantly greater in 2020 than the same time frame in 2019 (p < 0.05). The results showed that 0.58 % of volunteers were deferred from blood donation to avoid transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The rate of COVID-19 deferrals in all types except travelling to affected areas has increased in the second 30-day of the study (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The blood shortage that occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak was not due to increased deferral for COVID-19, but it was mostly due to a decrease in the number of volunteers who referred to BTCs.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050220303827; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050220303827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468406/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2020.103049";02/01/2021;Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization;0.9401
220;Could glutathione depletion be the Trojan horse of COVID-19 mortality?;10.26355/eurrev_202012_24046;OBJECTIVE Since the emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the death toll has been increasing daily. Many risk factors are associated with a high mortality rate in COVID-19. Establishment of a common pathway among these risk factors could improve our understanding of COVID-19 severity and mortality. This review aims at establishing this common pathway and its possible effect on COVID-19 mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS The current review was executed in five consecutive stages starting from determining the risk factors of COVID-19 mortality and trying to find a common pathway among them depending on the available literature. This was followed by proposing a mechanism explaining how this common pathway could increase the mortality. Finally, its potential role in managing COVID-19 was proposed. RESULTS This review identified this common pathway to be a low baseline of reduced glutathione (i.e., GSH) level. In particular, this review provided an in-depth discussion regarding the pathophysiology by which COVID-19 leads to GSH depletion, tissue damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, the current review demonstrated how GSH depletion could result in failure of the immune system and rendering the end organs vulnerable to damage from the oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS This preclinical study shows that GSH depletion may have a central role in COVID-19 mortality and pathophysiology. Therefore, elevating the GSH level in tissues may decrease the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336769/";01/12/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9733
221;Tocilizumab therapy in five solid and composite tissue transplant recipients with early ARDS due to SARS‐CoV‐2;10.1111/ajt.16080;There is emerging data depicting the clinical presentation of COVID‐19 in solid organ transplant recipients but negligible data‐driven guidance on clinical management. A biphasic course has been described in some infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, beginning with a flu‐like illness followed by an intense inflammatory response characterized by elevated c‐reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL‐6), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with high mortality. The exuberant and possibly dysregulated immune response has prompted interest in therapeutic agents that target the cytokines involved, particularly IL‐6. Tocilizumab is an IL‐6 receptor antagonist with a record of use for a variety of rheumatologic conditions and cytokine release syndrome due to CAR T‐cell therapy but experience in solid organ and composite tissue transplant recipients (SOT/CTTRs) with SARS‐CoV‐2‐related ARDS has not been previously reported in detail. We present the clinical course of five SOT/CTTRs with SARS‐CoV‐2‐related ARDS that received tocilizumab with favorable short‐term outcomes in four. Responses were characterized by reductions in CRP, discontinuation of vasopressors, improved oxygenation and respiratory mechanics, and variable duration of ventilator support. Four bacterial infections occurred within two weeks of tocilizumab administration. We discuss safety concerns and the need for randomized comparative trials to delineate tocilizumab’s clinical utility in this population.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32476261/";31/05/2020;solid organ transplant recipients;0.9453
222;Longitudinal assessment of mental health and well-being in patients being treated with medications for opioid use disorder in primary care;10.1016/j.abrep.2021.100348;"Opioid use disorder (OUD) continues to be a significant problem in the United States, contributing to overdose and death. Recent efforts to expand access to treatment of OUD in primary care have increased the availability of medications for OUD (MOUDs). However, OUD is often accompanied by poor mental health and well-being, and it is not known if treatment with MOUDs alone is associated with improved psychological well-being. This study’s purpose was to examine changes in mental health and well-being in the first 6 months of treatment with MOUDs in a family medicine residency clinic. Patients (N = 126; M age = 34.6 years, SD = 10.6; 54.8% male; 71.4% white) completed validated screeners of mental health and well-being (depression, anxiety, anger, loneliness, perceived stress, meaning in life, and life satisfaction) at baseline (induction visit for buprenorphine), 1-month, and 6-months. Results indicated that the mental health and well-being indices did not significantly change over the first 6 months of treatment on MOUDs. There were initial decreases in depression and anxiety at 1-month; however, both increased and were equivalent to baseline levels at 6-months. These results suggest that MOUD treatment alone does not significantly impact mental health or well-being in patients with OUD. Additional treatments or supports are clearly needed to address the comorbid mental health and well-being challenges in this population, as these factors can be both antecedents and consequences of substance misuse.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997252/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2021.100348";23/04/2021;Opioid use disorder;0.9639
223;Temporal and geographical variation of COVID-19 in-hospital fatality rate in Brazil;10.1101/2021.02.19.21251949;Background: Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 In-Hospital Fatality Rate (IHFR) varies between regions and has been diminishing over time. It is believed that the continuous improvement in the treatment of patients, age group of hospitalized, and the availability of hospital resources might be affecting the temporal and regional variation of IHFR. In this study, we explored how the IHFR varied along time and among age groups and federative states in Brazil. In addition, we also assessed the relationship between hospital structure availability and peaks of IHFR. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all COVID-19 hospitalizations with confirmed outcomes in 21 states between March 01 and September 22, 2020 (N=345,281) was done. We fit GLM binomial models with additive and interaction effects between age groups, epidemiological weeks, and states. We also evaluated the association between the modeled peak of IHFR in each state and the variables of hospital structure using the Spearman rank correlation test. Results: We found that the temporal variation of the IHFR was heterogeneous among the states, and in general it followed the temporal trends in hospitalizations. In addition, the peak of IHFR was higher in states with a smaller number of doctors and intensivists, and in states in which a higher percentage of people relied on the Public Health System (SUS) for medical care. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the pressure over the healthcare system is affecting the temporal trends of IHFR in Brazil.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.19.21251949; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21251949v1?rss=1";23/02/2021;In-Hospital Fatality Rate;0.9159
224;Endovascular Treatment for Lateral Wall Paraclinoid Aneurysms and the Influence of Internal Carotid Artery Angle.;10.2176/nmc.oa.2020-0307;Lateral wall paraclinoid aneurysms (LPA) are a rare type of aneurysm located on the lesser curve side of the internal carotid artery (ICA) bend, at the level of the anterior clinoid process. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of flexion of the ICA on the morphology of aneurysms and outcome of endovascular treatment. Between 2003 and 2018, we treated 643 cases of unruptured paraclinoid aneurysms with endovascular therapy in our institution. Of those cases, aneurysms projecting laterally on preoperative angiography were defined as LPA. The degree of bending of the ICA (ICA angle) was measured and statistically analyzed in relation to the aneurysm characteristics and the occlusion status after treatment. In all, 43 aneurysms were identified. ICA angle was positively correlated with the maximum dome size of the aneurysm (P <0.01) and the aspect ratio (P <0.01), and negatively correlated with the volume coil embolization ratio (P <0.01). Complete occlusion (CO) was achieved in 23 cases (53.5%) immediately after treatment, and in 35 cases (81.4%) at follow-up. The mean ICA angle in the incomplete occlusion group was significantly larger than in the CO group (P = 0.01). Larger ICA angle resulted in recurrence, whereas smaller ICA angle was more likely to obtain progressive thrombosis (P = 0.02). Endovascular treatment for LPA was safe and effective. The degree of flexion of the ICA may contribute to the level of hemodynamic stress on the aneurysm, its morphology, and the embolization effect.;"https://doi.org/10.2176/nmc.oa.2020-0307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716235/";12/03/2021;Complete occlusion;0.9946

A large linked administrative dataset was utilised. Women were grouped into socioeconomic quintiles using an area-based measure of socioeconomic status. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify the distribution of number of services, out of pocket fees, and government funding by socioeconomic quintile. Needs-adjusted concentration indices (CINA) were utilised to quantify inequity. The mean out of pocket fees for women of least socioeconomic advantage was $1,026 and for women of most socioeconomic advantage the mean was $2,432 (CINA 0.093, 95% CI: 0.088 - 0.098).

226;In Vitro and In Vivo Antiviral Activity of Gingerenone A on Influenza A Virus Is Mediated by Targeting Janus Kinase 2;10.3390/v12101141;"Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been developed as novel immunomodulatory drugs and primarily used for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have suggested that this category of anti-inflammatory drugs could be potentially useful for the control of inflammation “storms” in respiratory virus infections. In addition to their role in regulating immune cell functions, JAK1 and JAK2 have been recently identified as crucial cellular factors involved in influenza A virus (IAV) replication and could be potentially targeted for antiviral therapy. Gingerenone A (Gin A) is a compound derived from ginger roots and a dual inhibitor of JAK2 and p70 S6 kinase (S6K1). Our present study aimed to determine the antiviral activity of Gin A on influenza A virus (IAV) and to understand its mechanisms of action. Here, we reported that Gin A suppressed the replication of three IAV subtypes (H1N1, H5N1, H9N2) in four cell lines. IAV replication was also inhibited by Ruxolitinib (Rux), a JAK inhibitor, but not by PF-4708671, an S6K1 inhibitor. JAK2 overexpression enhanced H5N1 virus replication and attenuated Gin A-mediated antiviral activity. In vivo experiments revealed that Gin A treatment suppressed IAV replication in the lungs of H5N1 virus-infected mice, alleviated their body weight loss, and prolonged their survival. Our study suggests that Gin A restricts IAV replication by inhibiting JAK2 activity; Gin A could be potentially useful for the control of influenza virus infections.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33050000/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12101141";08/10/2020;a JAK inhibitor;0.9151
227;QOLEC2: a randomized controlled trial on nutritional and respiratory counseling after esophagectomy for cancer;10.1007/s00520-020-05573-z;BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy for cancer strongly impairs quality of life. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the nutritional and respiratory counseling on postoperative quality of life. METHODS: At hospital discharge, patients were randomized into four groups receiving respectively: nutritional and respiratory counseling, nutritional counseling alone, respiratory counseling alone, or standard care. The main endpoint was the impairment in quality of life in the first month after surgery. Linear mixed effect models were estimated to assess mean score differences (MDs) in quality of life scores. RESULTS: Patients receiving nutritional counseling reported less appetite loss (MD − 17.7, 95% CI − 32.2 to −3.3) than those not receiving nutritional counseling at 1 month after surgery. Dyspnea was similar between patients receiving vs. those not receiving respiratory counseling (MD − 3.1, 95% CI − 10.8 to 4.6). Global quality of life was clinically similar between patients receiving vs. those not receiving nutritional counseling over time (MD 0.9, 95% CI − 5.5 to 7.3), as well as in patients receiving vs. those not receiving respiratory counseling over time (MD 0.7, 95% CI − 5.9 to 7.2). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive postoperative care does not affect global quality of life even if nutritional counseling reduced appetite loss.

Although a complex and multi-faceted problem, inappropriate antibiotic use has repeatedly been identified as one of the main drivers of the acceleration and spread of AMR. Behaviors associated with antibiotic prescription and use have been extensively investigated in human medicine and in the livestock sector of veterinary medicine. There is now a growing interest in the factors that drive inappropriate antibiotic use in companion animal medicine, as the significance of antimicrobial use in this sector is being recognized. Additionally, the possibility of an alternative antimicrobial, phage therapy, being implemented into companion animal medicine is explored in this study. Interviews revealed complexities in the vet-owner relationship including conflicting perceptions of responsibility regarding antibiotic prescription and use, distrust of vets' intentions, and misconception of clients' needs. A need for alternative antimicrobials was evident, as all vets were able to report difficulties finding antibiotics to treat infections as a common occurrence. Questionnaire results indicated that vets and pet owners are open to the use of phage therapy in companion animals. This study shows that an alternative antimicrobial such as phage therapy could be accepted into companion animal medicine in the UK; however, effective communication between vets and pet owners is vital if antibiotic use is to be reduced and new antimicrobials are successfully implemented.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7550658/;29/09/2020;Antimicrobial resistance;0.9414
229;Modeling analysis of COVID-19 based on morbidity data in Anhui, China.;10.3934/mbe.2020158;Since the first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan Hubei, China, was reported in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the country and overseas. The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly.

To effectively address the problem of malnutrition, especially in resource-scarce communities, knowing the prevalence, causes and risk factors associated with it are essential steps. This scoping review aimed to identify the existing literature that uses classical regression analysis on nationally representative health survey data sets to find the individual socioeconomic, demographic and contextual risk factors associated with malnutrition among children under five years of age in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). Methods: The electronic databases searched include EMBASE (OVID platform), PubMed (MEDLINE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, Web of Science (WoS) and Cochrane Library. Only papers written in the English language, and for which the publication date was between 1 January 1990 and 31 July 2020, were included. Results: A total of 229 papers were identified, of which 26 were studies that have been included in the review. The risk factors for malnutrition identified were classified as child-related, parental/household-related and community or area-related.

In the process, gold ions in a gold chloride (HAuCl4) solution were reduced using trisodium citrate (Na3Ct), a reducing agent, and upon UV illumination, red-colored AuNPs were produced in the presence of LAMP amplicons. The nitrogenous bases of the target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) acted as a physical support for capturing gold ions dissolved in the sample. The high affinity of gold with the nitrogenous bases enabled facile detection within 10 min, and the detection limit of COVID-19 plasmid DNA was as low as 42 fg μL-1. To ensure POCT, we designed a portable device that contained arrays of reagent chambers and detection chambers. In the portable device, colorimetric reagents such as HAuCl4 and Na3Ct were contained in the reagent chambers; these reagents were subsequently transferred to the detection chambers where LAMP amplicons were present and thus allowed convenient sample delivery and multiplex detection. Owing to the high sensitivity of the in situ AuNPs, simplicity of portable device fabrication, and rapid colorimetric detection, we strongly believe that the fabricated portable device could serve as a kit for rapid POCT for instantaneous detection of infectious diseases, and could be readily usable at the bedside.";"https://doi.org/10.1039/d1lc00019e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33554994/";08/02/2021;Coronavirus;0.965

Antibiotic Utilization During the COVID-19 Surge in Detroit;10.1093/ofid/ofaa439.253;"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic overutilization during the COVID-19 pandemic has been reported, despite relatively infrequent bacterial co-infection. We explored antibiotic utilization before, during and after the COVID-19 surge in Michigan. METHODS: Cross-sectional study at an 877-bed hospital in Detroit, Michigan from January 2019 through May 2020. Measures: Count of COVID-19 hospital admissions by day. Monthly antibiotic utilization for formulary agents used to treat pneumonia were measured using monthly days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 patient days present and the National Health Care Safety Network Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratio (SAAR). Descriptive analysis was utilized. RESULTS: The first COVID-19 case was detected March 11, 2020 and peaked in early April (Figure 1). Antibiotic utilization is demonstrated in Figure 2. The COVID-19 peak was associated with increased use of multiple antibiotics; notably, DOT per 1000 days present for ceftriaxone, cefepime and doxycycline were 85.43, 79.42 and 71.56, respectively in April. The institutional all-antibacterial SAAR was significantly reduced in May at 0.96, p=0.0022, after the COVID-19 surge.

This guide does not set a standard of practice but contains recommendations that may avoid some of the ""lessons learned"" with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, the board-certified core aesthetic physicians classified these recommendations into four generalized areas: Practice Management; Supplies and Inventory; Office Staffing Considerations and Protocols; and Patient Management Strategies. Proactive strategies are provided in each of these categories that, if implemented, may alleviate the processes involved with an efficient office closure and reopening process including, in the case of COVID-19, methods to reduce the risk of transmission to doctors, staff, and patients. These strategies also include being prepared for emergency-related notifications of employees and patients; the acquisition of necessary equipment and supplies such as personal protective equipment; and the maintenance and accessibility of essential data and contact information for patients, vendors, financial advisors, and other pertinent entities.J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(1):10-16. doi:10.36849/JDD.2021.5803.";"https://doi.org/10.36849/jdd.2021.5803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400419/";01/01/2021;coronavirus pandemic;0.9113

Based on single-cell transcriptomes of nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples from clinically well-characterized patients presenting with moderate and critical severities, we reveal the different types and states of airway epithelial cells that are vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In COVID-19 patients, we observed a two- to threefold increase of cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 within the airway epithelial cell compartment. ACE2 is upregulated in epithelial cells through Interferon signals by immune cells suggesting that the viral defense system may increase the number of potentially susceptible cells in the respiratory epithelium. Infected epithelial cells recruit and activate immune cells by chemokine signaling. Recruited T lymphocytes and inflammatory macrophages were hyperactivated and showed a strong interaction with epithelial cells. In critical patients, increased expression of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL8, IL1B and TNF in macrophages was identified as a likely cause of a hyperinflammatory lung pathology. Moreover, we observed exacerbated epithelial cell death, likely leading to lung injury and respiratory failure in fatal cases.

Methotrexate has a narrow treatment index and is associated with numerous side effects.In thisresearch, for the first time a double-solvent supramolecular system (DSS) was developed as an extractant without disperser solvent for dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME). DSS - DLLME was applied to the extraction of methotrexate in plasma of children with acute leukemiaprior to itsdetermination by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC - UV). In the present method, two long normal chain alcohols are mixed in a particular ratio, and then it is injected into the sample solution, which is on the magnetic stirrer. In this case, the mixture of the two alcohol changes to new supramolecular aggregate. This new supermolecule is used as an extractant, which has a higher extraction power than any of its components alone.

First, the role of ACE2 itself is still a matter of investigation, and no specific drugs are available targeting ACE2. Second, as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2, there is an impairment of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) involved in the functioning of vital organs like the heart, kidney, brain, and lungs. In developing antiviral drugs for COVID-19, ACE2, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the specific enzymes involved in the viral and cellular gene expression have been the primary targets. SARS-CoV-2 being a new virus with unusually high mortality, there has been a need to get medicines in an emergency, and the drug repurposing has been a primary strategy. Considering extensive mortality and morbidity throughout the world, we have made a maiden attempt to discover the drugs interacting with RAS and identify the lead compounds from herbal plants using molecular docking. Both host ACE2 and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and ORF8 appear to be the primary targets for the treatment of COVID-19. While the drug repurposing of currently approved drugs seems to be one strategy for the treatment of COVID-19, purposing phytochemicals may be another essential strategy for discovering lead compounds.

237;Detecting and Assessing Suicide Ideation During the COVID-19 Pandemic.;10.1016/j.jcjq.2021.04.002;BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid shift to virtual (video and telephone) delivery of mental health care, disrupting established processes for identifying people at increased risk of suicidal behavior. METHODS Following the shift to virtual care, Kaiser Permanente Washington implemented a series of workflow changes to administer standard screening and monitoring questionnaires at virtual visits and to complete structured suicide risk assessments for patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation. These new workflows included automated distribution of questionnaires via the electronic health record (EHR) patient portal and automated alerts to clinicians regarding indicators of high risk. RESULTS In March 2020, in-person mental health visits were rapidly and completely replaced by video and telephone visits. The proportion of mental health visits with completed screening and monitoring questionnaires fell from approximately 80% in early 2020 to approximately 30% in late March, then gradually recovered to approximately 60% by the end of 2020. Among patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation on monitoring questionnaires, the proportion with a recorded suicide risk assessment fell from over 90% in early 2020 to approximately 40% in late March, then gradually recovered to nearly 100% by the end of 2020.

Through interviews with PA faculty and leaders, we provide some examples of areas of innovation in education, especially on the possibilities presented by a more flexible approach to innovation from the accreditation body than many PA faculty might perceive. One initial conclusion is that PA educators should focus more on helping students to ""think like clinicians"" from the start of their education. This paper is primarily intended to stimulate dialog, and we encourage all PA educators to form-and more importantly, share-their own thoughts and questions, through the PAEA professional learning communities and Digital Learning Hub (PAEAlearning.org/learn/digital-learning-hub/).";"https://doi.org/10.1097/jpa.0000000000000320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810056/";17/08/2020;physician assistant;0.9194
239;Two clinical markers for DLD in monolingual Italian speakers: what can they tell us about second language learners with DLD?;10.1080/02699206.2020.1830303;"A large number of children worldwide are only exposed to their L2 around 3 years of age and can exhibit linguistic behaviours that resemble those of a child with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). This can lead to under- or over-identification of DLD in this population. This study endeavors to contribute to overcoming this problem, by determining whether two specific clinical markers used with the Italian monolingual population can also be used with early L2 acquiring children, namely clitic production and non-word repetition. Our study involved two groups of 5-year-old L2 learners of Italian from various language backgrounds; 18 children had been referred to Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) services (EL2_DLD), and 30 children were typically developing (EL2_TD). The participants completed an Italian clitic production task and a non-word repetition task based on Italian phonotactics. Data was also collected from the participants' caregivers with the ALDeQ Parental Questionnaire to obtain information about the children's L1. Our results suggest that non-word repetition and clitic production in Italian are potentially useful for identifying L2 learners of Italian with DLD, at the age of 5 years. The repetition of non-words is highly accurate in identifying children with DLD among the participants, while clitic production is somewhat less discriminative in this sample. This study is a first step towards uncovering clinical markers that could be used to determine the presence of DLD in children acquiring their L2.";"https://doi.org/10.1080/02699206.2020.1830303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33032455/";09/10/2020;Developmental Language Disorder;0.9837
240;Unmet needs in the management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;10.1007/s11739-020-02612-9;Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are episodes of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that require additional therapy. These events play a pivotal role in the natural course of the disease and are associated with a progressive decline in lung function, reduced health status, a low physical activity level, tremendous health care costs, and increased mortality. Although most exacerbations have an infectious origin, the underlying mechanisms are heterogeneous and specific predictors of their occurrence in individual patients are currently unknown. Accurate prediction and early diagnosis of exacerbations is essential to develop novel targets for prevention and personalized treatments to reduce the impact of these events. Several potential biomarkers have previously been studied, these however lack specificity, accuracy and do not add value to the available clinical predictors. At present, microbial composition and host-microbiome interactions in the lung are increasingly recognized for their role in affecting the susceptibility to exacerbations, and may steer towards a novel direction in the management of COPD exacerbations. This narrative review describes the current challenges and unmet needs in the management of acute exacerbations of COPD. Exacerbation triggers, biological clusters, current treatment strategies, and their limitations, previously studied biomarkers and prediction tools, the lung microbiome and its role in COPD exacerbations as well as future directions are discussed.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616876/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02612-9";22/02/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9426

That is why some prediction methods are required to estimate the magnitude of infected cases and masses of studies on distinct methods of forecasting are represented so far. In this study, we proposed a hybrid machine learning model that is not only predicted with good accuracy but also takes care of uncertainty of predictions. The model is formulated using Bayesian Ridge Regression hybridized with an n-degree Polynomial and uses probabilistic distribution to estimate the value of the dependent variable instead of using traditional methods. This is a completely mathematical model in which we have successfully incorporated with prior knowledge and posterior distribution enables us to incorporate more upcoming data without storing previous data. Also, L(2) (Ridge) Regularization is used to overcome the problem of overfitting. To justify our results, we have presented case studies of three countries, −the United States, Italy, and Spain. In each of the cases, we fitted the model and estimate the number of possible causes for the upcoming weeks. Our forecast in this study is based on the public datasets provided by John Hopkins University available until 11th May 2020. We are concluding with further evolution and scope of the proposed model.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7581693/;23/10/2020;Coronavirus Disease 2019;0.9007

Prior studies links between obesity, nutrition and depression among women. However, less is known how food insecurity may moderate that relationship. METHODS: Data were employed from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES), 2001–2003. Two logistic regression models were Logistic regression was used to determine the association between obesity, gender, food insecurity, and past year Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We then stratified by gender, and tested the association between obesity and past year MDD, and if food insecurity moderated the association. RESULTS: Obesity was associated with an increased risk for past year Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) among females (AOR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.17–1.55) and was not associated among males (AOR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.86–1.32). Women who reported that reported both obesity and food insecurity reported higher odds of past year MDD episode (AOR = 3.16; 95% CI, 2.36–4.21, than women who did not report food insecurity (AOR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.38).

243;SeXX and COVID-19: tussle between the two.;10.4081/monaldi.2020.1461;"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected nearly 7 million individuals and claimed more than 0.4 million lives to date. There are several reports of gender differences related to infection and death due to COVID-19. This raises important questions such as ""Whether there are differences based on gender in risk and severity of infection or mortality rate?"" and ""What are the biological explanation and mechanisms underlying these differences?"" Emerging evidences have proposed sex-based immunological, genetic, and hormonal differences to explain this ambiguity. Besides biological differences, women have also faced social inequities and economic hardships due to this pandemic. Several recent studies have shown that independent of age males are at higher risk for severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Although susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 was found to be similar across both genders in several disease cohorts, a disproportionate death ratio in men can be partly explained by the higher burden of pre-existing diseases and occupational exposures among men. At immunological point of view, females can engage a more active immune response, which may protect them and counter infectious diseases as compared to men. This attribute of better immune responses towards pathogens is thought to be due to high estrogen levels in females. Here we review the current knowledge about sex differences in susceptibility, the severity of infection and mortality, host immune responses, and the role of sex hormones in COVID-19 disease.";"https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32945643/";18/09/2020;Novel coronavirus disease;0.9699
244;Functional characterization of a broad and potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against outer membrane protein (OMP) of Salmonella typhimurium;10.1007/s00253-020-10394-5;In the present study, we have generated a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) named Sal-06 by using the crude outer membrane protein preparation of Salmonella enteric subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 strain as antigen. Sal-06mAb belonging to IgG1 isotype demonstrated broad cross-reactivity to standard and isolated strains of genus Salmonella and others such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Proteus mirabilis. Cross-reactivity across several bacterial genera indicated that the epitopes reactive to Sal-06mAb are conserved among these members. Neutralizing effects of Sal-06mAb on Salmonella growth and survival was evaluated in vitro using bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity with and without complement and bacterial invasion inhibition assay. Sal-06mAb demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect on the growth of S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 strain which is both time and concentration (of mAb) dependent. It was also found that the bacterial growth inhibition was complement independent. When the bacterial cells were preincubated with Sal-06mAb, it reduced the adherence and invasion of bacterial cells into A549 epithelial cell line. This was confirmed by CFU count analysis, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopy. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging confirmed the antimicrobial effects of Sal-06mAb on S. typhimurium ATCC 14028.

This virus is supposed to be spread by human to human transmission. Cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 which is identical or similar in different species of animals such as pigs, ferrets, cats, orangutans, monkeys, and humans. Moreover, a recent study predicted that dog might be secondary host during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bat to human. Therefore, there is a possibility of spreading SARS-CoV-2 through domestic pets. There are now many reports of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in dogs, cats, tigers, lion, and minks. Experimental data showed ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as infected by virus inoculation and can transmit the virus directly or indirectly by droplets or airborne route. Based on these natural infection reports and experimental data, whether the pets are responsible for SARS-CoV-2 spread to human; needs to be deeply investigated. Humans showing clinical symptoms of respiratory infections have been undergoing for COVID-19 diagnostic test but many infected people and few pets confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic.

Reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to other species has been documented in pet cats and dogs, big cats and gorillas in zoos, and farmed mink. As SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to known bat viruses, assessment of the potential risk of transmission of the virus from humans to bats, and its subsequent impacts on conservation and public health, is warranted. A qualitative risk assessment was conducted by a multi-disciplinary group to assess this risk in bats in the Australian context, with the aim of informing risk management strategies for human activities involving interactions with bats. The overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 establishing in an Australian bat population was assessed to be Low, however with a High level of uncertainty. The outcome of the assessment indicates that, for the Australian situation where the prevalence of COVID-19 in humans is very low, it is reasonable for research and rehabilitation of bats to continue, provided additional biosecurity measures are applied. Risk assessment is challenging for an emerging disease where information is lacking and the situation is changing rapidly; assessments should be revised if human prevalence or other important factors change significantly.

An increase of glycolysis pathway leading to pyruvate escalation is the mechanism of hyperlactatemia in β2-adrenergic agonist drug. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old man who had poor-controlled asthma, presented with progressive dyspnea with coryza symptom for 6 days. He was intubated and admitted into medical intensive care unit due to deteriorated respiratory symptom. Severe asthmatic attack was diagnosed and approximate 1.5 canisters of salbutamol inhaler was administrated within 24 h of admission. Initial severe acidosis consisted of acute respiratory acidosis from ventilation-perfusion mismatch and acute metabolic acidosis resulting from bronchospasm and hypoxia-related lactic acidosis, respectively. The lactate level was normalized in 6 h after hypoxemia and ventilation correction. Given the lactate level re-elevated into a peak of 4.6 mmol/L without signs of tissue hypoxia nor other possible etiologies, the salbutamol toxicity was suspected and the inhaler was discontinued that contributed to rapid lactate clearance. The patient was safely discharged on the 6th day of admission. CONCLUSION: The re-elevation of serum lactate in status asthmaticus patient who had been administrated with the vast amount of β2-adrenergic agonist should be considered for salbutamol-induced lactic acidosis and promptly discontinued especially when there were no common potentials.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7801875/;12/01/2021;Salbutamol-induced lactic acidosis;0.9217
248;Biotreatment and bacterial succession in an upflow immobilized cell bioreactor fed with fludioxonil wastewater.;10.1007/s11356-020-09231-z;The large quantities and the persistent nature of fungicide wastewaters have increased the efforts towards a sustainable technological solution. In this context, fludioxonil-contaminated wastewater was treated in an upflow immobilized cell bioreactor, resulting in chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency even higher than 80%, whereas the electrical conductivity (EC) of the effluent was gradually increased. Organic-F was mineralized by 94.0 ± 5.2%, which was in accordance with the high fludioxonil removal efficiency (95.4 ± 4.0%). In addition, effluent total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentration reduced significantly during bioprocessing. A strong relationship among COD removal, TKN/total nitrogen removal, and effluent EC increase (p < 0.01) was identified. Despite the adequate aeration provided, effluent nitrite and nitrate concentrations were negligible. Illumina sequencing revealed a reduction in the relative abundances of Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Firmicutes and an increase in the proportion of Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. A shift in bacterial communities occurred during fludioxonil treatment, resulting in the significant increase of the relative abundances of Empedobacter, Sphingopyxis, and Rhodopseudomonas (from 0.67 ± 0.13% at the start-up to 34.34 ± 1.60% at the end of biotreatment).

This antimalarial drug is also chronically used to treat patients with autoimmune diseases. METHODS: By analysing the Portuguese anonymized data on private and public based medical prescriptions we have identified all cases chronically receiving HCQ for the management of diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases. Additionally, we have detected all laboratory confirmed cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and all laboratory confirmed negative cases in the Portuguese population (mandatorily registered in a centrally managed database). Cross linking the two sets of data has allowed us to compare the proportion of HCQ chronic treatment (at least 2 grams per month) in laboratory confirmed cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with laboratory confirmed negative cases. RESULTS: Out of 26,815 SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients, 77 (0.29%) were chronically treated with HCQ, while 1,215 (0.36%) out of 333,489 negative patients were receiving it chronically (P=0.04). After adjustment for age, sex, and chronic treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants, the odds ratio of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection for chronic treatment with HCQ has been 0.51 (0.37‐0.70).

250;Time-Fluid Field-Based Coordination;10.1007/978-3-030-50029-0_13;Emerging application scenarios, such as cyber-physical systems (CPSs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing, call for coordination approaches addressing openness, self-adaptation, heterogeneity, and deployment agnosticism. Field-based coordination is one such approach, promoting the idea of programming system coordination declaratively from a global perspective, in terms of functional manipulation and evolution in “space and time” of distributed data structures, called fields. More specifically, regarding time, in field-based coordination it is assumed that local activities in each device, called computational rounds, are regulated by a fixed clock, typically, a fair and unsynchronized distributed scheduler. In this work, we challenge this assumption, and propose an alternative approach where the round execution scheduling is naturally programmed along with the usual coordination specification, namely, in terms of a field of causal relations dictating what is the notion of causality (why and when a round has to be locally scheduled) and how it should change across time and space. This abstraction over the traditional view on global time allows us to express what we call “time-fluid” coordination, where causality can be finely tuned to select the event triggers to react to, up to to achieve improved balance between performance (system reactivity) and cost (usage of computational resources). We propose an implementation in the aggregate computing framework, and evaluate via simulation on a case study.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282850/;13/05/2020;cyber-physical systems;0.9801
251;Coronaviruses and Endocrine System: a Systematic Review on Evidences and Shadows.;10.2174/1871530320666200905123332;Coronaviruses are a big family of viruses that can infect mammalians and birds. In humans they mainly cause respiratory tract infections, with a large spectrum of severity, from mild, self-limited infections to highly lethal forms as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Scanty data are reported for the involvement of endocrine glands by human coronaviruses, in particular SARS-CoV-2. In this review we summarize endocrinological involvement by human coronaviruses, including data on animal coronaviruses. Avians, ferrets and bovine are affected by specific coronavirus syndromes, with variable involvement of endocrine glands. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as target receptor, so ACE2 plays a central role for viral transmission and initial organ involvement. Autoptic studies on SARS patients revealed that thyroid, parathyroid, pituitary gland, endocrine pancreas and especially adrenals and testis can be impaired by different mechanisms (direct damage by SARS-CoV, inflammation, vascular derangement and autoimmune reactions) and few clinical studies have evidenced functional endocrine impairment. Only few data are available for COVID-19 and gonads and endocrine pancreas seem to be involved.

Acute lung inflammatory edema is a major pathological finding in autopsies explaining O2 diffusion failure and hypoxemia. Only dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in severe cases, further supporting a role for inflammation in disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells employing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells. ACE2 is one of the components of the cellular machinery that inactivates the potent inflammatory agent bradykinin, and SARS-CoV-2 infection could interfere with the catalytic activity of ACE2, leading to accumulation of bradykinin. In this open-label, randomized clinical trial, we tested two pharmacological inhibitors of the kinin-kallikrein system that are currently approved for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, icatibant and inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein, in a group of 30 patients with severe COVID-19. Neither icatibant nor inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein resulted in significant changes in disease mortality and time to clinical improvement. However, both compounds promoted significant improvement of lung computed tomography scores and increased blood eosinophils, which has been reported as an indicator of disease recovery. In this small cohort, we found evidence for a beneficial role of pharmacological inhibition of the kinin-kallikrein system in two markers that indicate improved disease recovery.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.20167353; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.11.20167353v1?rss=1";14/08/2020;Coronavirus disease-19;0.9684
253;Effects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak.;10.3934/mbe.2020147;The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.;"https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233561/";10/03/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9477
254;COVID‐19: The rising cost of cardiac surgery and disease;10.1111/jocs.15206;The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19) pandemic has resulted in widespread economic, health and social disruptions. The delivery of cardiovascular care has been stifled during the pandemic to adhere to infection control measures as a way of protecting patients and the workforce at large. This cautious approach has been protective since individuals with COVID‐19 and cardiovascular disease are anticipated to have poorer outcomes and an increased risk of death. The combination of postponing elective cardiovascular surgeries, reduced acute care and long‐term cardiac damage directly resulting from COVID‐19 will likely have increased the demand for cardiac care, particularly from patients presenting with more severe symptoms. The combination of increased demand and inhibited supply will likely result in huge backlog of unmet patients' needs. The novelty, virulence and infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused substantial morbidity and mortality, thus necessitating modifications to the UK government's healthcare strategy. Without improving cost efficiency, the UK's ageing population will likely need an increasing spend on cardiac surgery simply to maintain the same level of service. However, the government's short‐term increase in spending is unsustainable especially in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty. This means that the long‐term impact of COVID‐19 will only increase the need to find innovative ways of delivering equivalent or superior cardiac care at a reduced unit cost.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33259108/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.15206";01/12/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9554

METHODS: Data on the care situation were collected by means of a survey in 38 out of 388 contacted psychiatric and psychotherapy hospitals in Germany over the course of 1 month. The changes and adaptations of the care structures, the type of therapy measures applied and care options for people with mental disorders and a COVID-19 infection as well as the legal basis underlying the care for patients unable to consent were documented. RESULTS: On average, the inpatient treatment capacity of psychiatric hospitals in Germany decreased by approximately 40% compared with prepandemic periods. Day clinic and outpatient services were also only available in a limited form or were even discontinued completely. Specialized wards for patients with COVID-19 infections were available in most of the surveyed clinics (84%). CONCLUSION: Psychiatric hospitals were already able to respond quickly and adequately to the crisis situation in the first wave of the pandemic, e.g. by setting up COVID wards; however, the reduction in treatment capacity to 60% has significantly worsened the care situation for people with mental illnesses.

RESULTS: Of a total of 726 ECG ambulatory monitors fitted in this period 60% were self-fitted. 97 patients gave feedback (13.3%). 84.4% of patients were satisfied with the process. 58.33% felt safer fitting it at home as 40% were fitted in-house due to limitations e.g. elderly/wheelchair/pregnant patients and/or those without access to view the videos. 6 monitors (<1%) were refitted due to artefact/early disconnection. Improvement suggestions implemented included simplifying instructions and adding specific information for female electrode placement. CONCLUSIONS: This project enabled vital cardiac diagnostics whilst maintaining social distancing - reducing infection risk and achieving high patient satisfaction. Implementing a locker system will decrease differing instructions and positively impact waiting times to further reduce viral transmission risks.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194718/;24/05/2021;Interruption of health services;0.9736
257;The COVID-19 pandemic, stress, and trauma in the disability community: A call to action.;10.1037/rep0000368;PURPOSE To inform the field of rehabilitation psychology about the impacts of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on the disability community in the United States and the additional sources of stress and trauma disabled people face during these times. METHOD A review of the literature on disability and COVID-19 is provided, with an emphasis on sources of trauma and stress that disproportionately impact the disability community and the ways in which disability intersects with other marginalized identities in the context of trauma and the pandemic. We also reflect on the potential impacts on the field of psychology and the ways in which psychologists, led by rehabilitation psychologists, can support disabled clients and the broader disability community at both the individual client and systemic levels. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic introduces unique potential sources of trauma and stress within the disability community, including concerns about health care rationing and ableism in health care, isolation, and the deaths and illnesses of loved ones and community members. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS Rehabilitation psychologists and other professionals should be aware of the potential for trauma and stress among disabled clients and work with them to mitigate its effects. Additionally, psychologists should also work with the disability community and disabled colleagues to address systemic and institutional ableism and its intersections with other forms of oppression.

The clusters of many cases were reported with the epidemic progresses. We collected currently available information for 377 COVID-19 clusters (1 719 cases), excluded the hospital clusters and Hubei cases, during the period from January 1, 2020 to February 20, 2020. There were 297 family clusters (79%), case median 4; 39 clusters of dining (10%), case median 5; 23 clusters of shopping malls or supermarkets (6%), case median 13; 12 clusters of work units (3%), case median 6, and 6 clusters of transportation. We selected 325 cases to estimate the incubation period and found its range is 1 to 20 days, median was 7 days, and mode was 4 days. The analysis of the epidemic situation in a department store in China indicates that there is a possibility of patients as the source of infection during the incubation period of the epidemic. From February 5, 2020 to February 21, 2020, 634 persons were infected in the Diamond Princess Liner. All persons are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The older, patients during the incubation period and the worse environment may be the cause of the cases rising. The progress of the two typical outbreaks clearly demonstrates the spread of the early cases in Wuhan. Whatever happens, screening and isolating close contacts remains essential except for clinical treatment during the epidemic. Especially for the healthy people in the epidemic area, isolation is the key.";"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200223-00153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145716/";08/03/2020;Corona Virus Disease;0.9439
259;Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome: advice in the times of COVID-19.;10.12688/f1000research.23275.1;"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory disease in China at the end of 2019. It then spread with enormous rapidity and by mid-March 2020 was declared a world pandemic. Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a worldwide prevalence of about 1% of the population. The clinical symptoms include multiple motor and one or more phonic (vocal) tics. Germane to this communication is that 85% of patients with GTS have associated psychiatric co-morbidities, many of which are being exacerbated in the current global health crisis. In addition, several symptoms of GTS may mimic COVID-19, such as a dry cough and sniffing (phonic tics), while other symptoms such as spitting, inappropriate touching of others and ""non-obscene socially inappropriate symptoms"" can potentially get patients with GTS into trouble with the law. We suggest that a clear explanation of the COVID-19 illness and GTS is important to enable colleagues of various specialities who tend to patients with GTS. It is important to acknowledge at the outset that the information available on the COVID-19 pandemic changes daily, including cases infected, deaths reported, and how various national health systems are planning and or coping or not.

260;Mask-associated ‘de novo’ headache in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic;10.1136/oemed-2020-106956;"OBJECTIVES: The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has changed care activities of health professionals. We analysed the possible association between the appearance of ‘de novo’ headache according to the type of mask used, the related factors and the impact of the cephalalgia on health professionals. METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital in Extremadura, Spain. We provided an online questionnaire to healthcare workers during the period of maximum incidence of COVID-19 in our setting. RESULTS: The subjects are n=306, 244 women (79.7%), with an average age of 43 years (range 23–65). Of the total, 129 (42.2%) were physicians, 112 (36.6%) nurses and 65 (21.2%) other health workers. 208 (79.7%) used surgical masks and 53 (20.3%) used filter masks. Of all those surveyed, 158 (51.6%) presented ‘de novo’ headache. The occurrence of a headache was independently associated with the use of a filter mask, OR 2.14 (95% CI 1.07 to 4.32); being a nurse, OR 2.09 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.72) or another health worker, OR 6.94 (95% CI 3.01 to 16.04); or having a history of asthma, OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.89).

261;Is Nigeria really on top of COVID-19? Message from effective reproduction number.;10.1017/s0950268820001740;Following the importation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) into Nigeria on 27 February 2020 and then the outbreak, the question is: How do we anticipate the progression of the ongoing epidemic following all the intervention measures put in place? This kind of question is appropriate for public health responses and it will depend on the early estimates of the key epidemiological parameters of the virus in a defined population. In this study, we combined a likelihood-based method using a Bayesian framework and compartmental model of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Nigeria to estimate the effective reproduction number (R(t)) and basic reproduction number (R(0)) – this also enables us to estimate the initial daily transmission rate (β(0)). We further estimate the reported fraction of symptomatic cases. The models are applied to the NCDC data on COVID-19 symptomatic and death cases from 27 February 2020 and 7 May 2020. In this period, the effective reproduction number is estimated with a minimum value of 0.18 and a maximum value of 2.29. Most importantly, the R(t) is strictly greater than one from 13 April till 7 May 2020. The R(0) is estimated to be 2.42 with credible interval: (2.37–2.47). Comparing this with the R(t) shows that control measures are working but not effective enough to keep R(t) below 1. Also, the estimated fraction of reported symptomatic cases is between 10 and 50%. Our analysis has shown evidence that the existing control measures are not enough to end the epidemic and more stringent measures are needed.;"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/6047DEAE6CE5904E15BA85CD725510AD/S0950268820001740a.pdf/div-class-title-is-nigeria-really-on-top-of-covid-19-message-from-effective-reproduction-number-div.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268820001740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32753078/";05/08/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9732
262;Conceptual and normative approaches to AI governance for a global digital ecosystem supportive of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs);10.1007/s43681-021-00058-z;"AI governance is like one of those mythical creatures that everyone speaks of but which no one has seen. Sometimes, it is reduced to a list of shared principles such as transparency, non-discrimination, and sustainability; at other times, it is conflated with specific mechanisms for certification of algorithmic solutions or ways to protect the privacy of personal data. We suggest a conceptual and normative approach to AI governance in the context of a global digital public goods ecosystem to enable progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Conceptually, we propose rooting this approach in the human capability concept—what people are able to do and to be, and in a layered governance framework connecting the local to the global. Normatively, we suggest the following six irreducibles: a. human rights first; b. multi-stakeholder smart regulation; c. privacy and protection of personal data; d. a holistic approach to data use captured by the 3Ms—misuse of data, missed use of data and missing data; e. global collaboration (‘digital cooperation’); f. basing governance more in practice, in particular, thinking separately and together about data and algorithms. Throughout the article, we use examples from the health domain particularly in the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic. We conclude by arguing that taking a distributed but coordinated global digital commons approach to the governance of AI is the best guarantee of citizen-centered and societally beneficial use of digital technologies for the SDGs.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8099993/;06/05/2021;UN Sustainable Development Goals;0.9218
263;Malicious traffic detection combined deep neural network with hierarchical attention mechanism.;10.1038/s41598-021-91805-z;Given the gradual intensification of the current network security situation, malicious attack traffic is flooding the entire network environment, and the current malicious traffic detection model is insufficient in detection efficiency and detection performance. This paper proposes a data processing method that divides the flow data into data flow segments so that the model can improve the throughput per unit time to meet its detection efficiency. For this kind of data, a malicious traffic detection model with a hierarchical attention mechanism is also proposed and named HAGRU (Hierarchical Attention Gated Recurrent Unit). By fusing the feature information of the three hierarchies, the detection ability of the model is improved. An attention mechanism is introduced to focus on malicious flows in the data flow segment, which can reasonably utilize limited computing resources. Finally, compare the proposed model with the current state of the method on the datasets. The experimental results show that: the novel model performs well in different evaluation indicators (detection rate, false-positive rate, F-score), and it can improve the performance of category recognition with fewer samples when the data is unbalanced. At the same time, the training of the novel model on larger datasets will enhance the generalization ability and reduce the false alarm rate. The proposed model not only improves the performance of malicious traffic detection but also provides a new research method for improving the efficiency of model detection.;"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91805-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117338/";11/06/2021;Hierarchical Attention Gated Recurrent Unit;0.9574

Methods: 64 older women (age = 72{+/-}5 ys) who participated in a physical exercise/educational program and adhered to government home confinement recommendations have their levels of physical activity, sedentary behavior and HRQL assessed before and during (11 to 13 weeks after introduction of government recommendations to reduce virus transmission) COVID-19 pandemic. Results: There were significant reductions in total physical activity (-259 METs/week, P = 0.02), as a result of a ~17.0 % reduction in walking (-30.8 min/week, P = 0.004) and ~41.8 % reduction in vigorous-intensity activity (-29.6 min/week, P < 0.001). Sedentary behavior also increased (2.24 h/week, P < 0.001; 1.07 h/week days, P < 0.001; and 1.54 h/weekend days, P < 0.001). However, no significant change occurred in moderate-intensity physical activity, and HRQL domains and facets, except for an improvement in environment domain. Conclusion: Home confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic decreased levels of physical activity and increased levels of sedentary behavior in previously active older women who participated in an educational program.

265;Early risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity in COVID-19 patients;10.1093/cid/ciaa490;BACKGROUND: Pneumonia COVID-19 has became a pandemic. However, information on early risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity is unavailable yet. METHODS: In this prospective study, a cohort of 137 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Clinical information and laboratory data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Viral positivity duration was calculated by an interval from the day SARS-CoV-2 positive confirmed to the day SARS-CoV-2 returned to negative in these 137 COVID-19 patients. Early risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity were evaluated. FINDINGS: The median SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration is 12 days (range: 4 days ~ 45 days) for this cohort. Cox regression results showed a significantly shorter viral positivity duration was related to younger [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.658, p = 0.017], not severe patient (HR = 0.653, p = 0.076), higher count of lymphocytes (HR = 1.464, p = 0.033), eosinophils (HR = 1.514, p = 0.020) and CD8+ T cells (HR=1.745, p=0.033), and lower IL-6 (HR = 0.664, p = 0.036) and IL-10 (HR = 0.631, p = 0.021). Multivariate analysis with covariables adjusted results showed that the count of CD8+ T cells (HR=2.376, p=0.114) was a predominant risk factor for the SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration. INTERPRETATION: Our findings firstly provided early laboratory parameters such as count of CD8+ T cells, as risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity, which have significance in control and prevention of the disease.;"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337591/";27/04/2020;Pneumonia;0.975

And yet, definitive therapies or preventive measures are not present. Purpose Herbal medicines have been a source of various antiviral compounds. An accelerated repurposing potential of antiviral herbs can provide usable drugs and identify druggable targets. In this study, we dissect the anti-coronavirus activity of Cissampelos pareira L (Cipa). using an integrative approach. Methods We analysed the signature similarities between predicted antiviral agents and Cipa using the connectivity map (https://clue.io/). Next, we tested the anti-SARS-COV-2 activity of Cipa in vitro. A three-way comparative analysis of Cipa transcriptome, COVID-19 BALF transcriptome and CMAP signatures of small compounds was also performed. Results Several predicted antivirals showed a high positive connectivity score with Cipa such as apcidin, emetine, homoharringtonine etc. We also observed 98% inhibition of SARS-COV-2 replication in infected Vero cell cultures with the whole extract. Some of its prominent pure constituents e.g pareirarine, cissamine, magnoflorine exhibited 40-80% inhibition. Comparison of genes between BALF and Cipa showed an enrichment of biological processes like transcription regulation and response to lipids, to be downregulated in Cipa while being upregulated in COVID-19. CMAP also showed that Triciribine, torin-1 and VU-0365114-2 had positive connectivity with BALF 1 and 2, and negative connectivity with Cipa.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.11.448155;13/06/2021;upregulated;0.9618
267;Perceptions of Practitioners on Telehealth and App Use for Smoking Cessation and COPD Care—An Exploratory Study;10.3390/medicina56120698;Background and objectives: With the digitalization of modern healthcare delivery, digital media adoption in clinical practice is increasing. Also, healthcare professionals are more and more confronted with patients using smartphone-based health applications (apps). This exploratory study aimed at surveying perceptions on such apps in the context of lung health among a cross section of Austrian practitioners involved in pulmonary care. Materials and Methods: The online questionnaire in German assessed socio-demographic characteristics, telehealth readiness as well as opinions on smoke-free and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) apps. We used descriptive statistics to report the finding. Results: We received valid responses from 55 participants (mean age 52.3 years, 69.1% males). Telehealth readiness was medium, indicating existence of certain barriers adversely impacting telehealth use. As for apps targeting smoking cessation and COPD, respondents indicated high relevance for visualization aspects for patients and control/overview features for the treating doctors. Only 40% of participants indicated that they would recommend a COPD app to an older patient. Conclusions: In smoking cessation therapy, doctors commonly adhere to the “5 A’s”: Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange. We suggest adding “App” as sixth A, assuming that in patient follow-up most of the other A’s could also be supported or even replaced by app features in the challenging task to tackle smoking-associated non-communicable diseases.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33333856/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina56120698";15/12/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9734
268;Effect of burnout among physicians on observed adverse patient outcomes: a literature review;10.1186/s12913-021-06371-x;BACKGROUND: Physician burnout has potentially harmful effects for both physicians and their patients. Despite relationships between physician burnout and lowered patient satisfaction and clinician-rated adverse patient outcomes, there is scarce literature regarding effects on objective patient outcomes. This study aimed to examine the relationship between physician burnout and observed adverse patient outcomes via a review of the literature. METHODS: A search was performed on the MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychINFO databases, using keywords and Medical Subject Headings. The identified studies were in English, published from 2007 to 2019, measured burnout among physicians using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and included observed adverse patient outcomes. In total, 360 eligible articles were identified, and 11 were included in the final review. All included studies measured patient outcomes by observed clinical measures (e.g. quality of care and medical errors). RESULTS: Four studies found a clear significant relationship between physician burnout and observed adverse patient outcomes, while 6 did not. One study found a significant relationship with one of the MBI subscales. Burnout was, in contrast to depression, only partly associated with observed patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This review illustrates the need for a validation of physician burnout measured by MBI with respect to observed patient outcomes. Further studies are required to investigate the effects of physician burnout on observed quality of their patient care.;"https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12913-021-06371-x; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06371-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33879135/";21/04/2021;Physician burnout;0.9205
269;Enhancement of skin permeability with thermal ablation techniques: concept to commercial products;10.1007/s13346-020-00823-3;Traditionally, the skin is considered as a protective barrier which acts as a highly impermeable region of the human body. But in recent times, it is recognized as a specialized organ that aids in the delivery of a wide range of drug molecules into the skin (intradermal drug delivery) and across the skin into systemic circulation (transdermal drug delivery, TDD). The bioavailability of a drug administered transdermally can be improved by several penetration enhancement techniques, which are broadly classified into chemical and physical techniques. Application of mentioned techniques together with efforts of various scientific and innovative companies had made TDD a multibillion dollar market and an average of 2.6 new transdermal drugs are being approved each year. Out of various techniques, the thermal ablation techniques involving chemicals, heating elements, lasers, and radiofrequency (RF) are proved to be more effective in terms of delivering the drug across the skin by disrupting the stratum corneum (SC). The reason behind it is that the thermal ablation technique resulted in improved bioavailability, quick treatment and fast recovery of the SC, and more importantly it does not cause any damage to underlying dermis layer. This review article mainly discussed about various thermal ablation techniques with commercial products and patents in each classes, and their safety aspects. This review also briefly presented anatomy of the skin, penetration pathways across the skin, and different generations of TDD.

270;Slow but evident recovery from neocortical dysfunction and cognitive impairment in a series of chronic COVID-19 patients.;10.2967/jnumed.121.262128;Cognitive impairment is a frequent complaint in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and can be related to cortical hypometabolism on 18F-FDG PET at the subacute stage. However, it is unclear if these changes are reversible. Methods: We prospectively assessed Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and 18F-FDG PET scans in 8 COVID-19 patients at the subacute (as no longer infectious) and chronic stages (approximately six months after symptom onset). The expression of the previously established COVID-19-related covariance pattern was analyzed at both stages to examine the time course of post-COVID-19 cognitive impairment. For further validation, we also conducted a conventional group analysis. Results: Follow-up 18F-FDG PET revealed a significant reduction of initial frontoparietal and, to a lesser extent, temporal glucose hypometabolism that was accompanied by a significant improvement in cognition. The expression of the previously established COVID-19-related pattern was significantly lower at follow-up and correlated inversely with MoCA performance. However, both 18F-FDG PET and cognitive assessment suggest a residual impairment. Conclusions: Although a significant recovery of regional neuronal function and cognition can be clearly stated, residuals are still measurable in some patients six months after the manifestation of COVID-19. Given the current pandemic situation and tremendous uncertainty concerning the long-term effects of COVID-19, the present study provides novel insights of highest medical and socioeconomic relevance.;"https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.121.262128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789937/";31/03/2021;coronavirus disease-19;0.9799
271;COVID-19 Impact in Neurosurgery Residency: Grit in the Face of Pandemic;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.04.057;Introduction The Coronavirus-19 (COVID) pandemic presented a significant challenge to healthcare providers. Neurosurgeons work with critically ill patients who were at particularly high risk for COVID and the pandemic produced ever-shifting circumstances to allow this continued care. This study explores the psychological impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical residents at a single institution. Methods Residents completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomology 30 (IDS-30) two validated surveys prior to and during the pandemic. PSS scores may range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicative of increased stress. IDS-30 ranges from 0 to 84 with higher scores indicating more severe levels of depression. Survey results were compared collectively amongst residents and statistically analyzed. Results The surveys had 19 out of 28 total responders (68%). Mean score on the PSS was 16.1 pre-pandemic and 14.7 during the pandemic (p>0.05). The mean score on the IDS-30 was 14.7 pre-pandemic and 12.0 during the pandemic (p> 0.05). Matching the survey questionnaire results by each resident revealed an average decrease of 2.3 and 2.4 for the PSS and IDS-30, respectively. Conclusion There were no significant changes in perceived stress or depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Resilience and perseverance are commonly sought traits amongst neurosurgical residents and are components stressed during their training. Neurosurgical residents prove unwavering while caring for patients during the COVID pandemic.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875021005982?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875021005982; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2021.04.057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33894398/";21/04/2021;Coronavirus-19;0.9443
272;A role of glycation and methylation for SARS-CoV-2 infection in diabetes?;10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110247;Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is a major comorbidity of COVID-19, and poorly controlled diabetes is associated with high mortality rate, emphasizing the necessity to improve glycemic control. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor responsible for SARS-CoV-2 access to human cells, and ACE2 expression is increased in patients with diabetes and hypertension treated with ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. We hypothesize that an upregulation of ACE2 due to its non-enzymatic glycation could be considered, by changing the protein tertiary structure in terms of amino acid (mostly lysine) available to be glycated. In fact, in a single ACE2 molecule, 34 lysine residues are present in the extracellular portion, and at least one of these is co-involved in a fundamental hydrogen-bond interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). The worse outcome of COVID-19 in people with diabetes could be related to the non-enzymatic glycation that triggers the activity of ACE2. Moreover, DNA methylation of genes regulating islet beta-cell function, as well as in insulin resistance of peripheral tissues such as liver, muscle, and adipose tissue may be involved, as already demonstrated for cancer conditions. DNA methylation, besides being considered as a biomarker to predict the risk of obesity and T2D, has been suggested also as a target for dietary and pharmacological treatments. The present observations may suggest further interventions in order to improve the outcome of COVID-19 in people affected by diabetes.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720324981; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110247; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720324981?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33254553/";03/09/2020;Type-2 diabetes;0.9604

Method: cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital in Extremadura, Spain. We administered an online questionnaire to healthcare workers during the period of maximum incidence of COVID-19 in our setting. Results: n=306, 244 women (79.7%), with an average age of 43 years (range 23-65). Of the total, 129 (42.2%) were physicians, 112 (36.6%) nurses and 65 (21.2%) other health workers. 208 (79.7%) used surgical masks and 53 (20.3%) used filtering masks. Of all those surveyed, 158 (51.6%) presented de novo headache. The occurrence of headache was independently associated with the use of a filtering mask, OR 2.14 (IC95% 1.07-4.32), being a nurse OR 2.09 (IC95% 1.18-3.72) or another health worker OR 6.94 (IC95% 3.01-16.04) or having a history of asthma OR 0.29 (IC95% 0.09-0.89). Depending on the type of mask used there were differences in headache intensity. And the impact of headache in the subjects who used a filtering mask was worse in the all aspects evaluated. Conclusions: The appearance of de novo headache is associated with the use of filtering masks and is more frequent in certain health care workers, causing a greater occupational, family, personal and social impact.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.07.20167957v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.20167957";11/08/2020;coronavirus;0.912
274;Bovine Collectins: Role in Health and Disease;10.1007/978-3-030-67048-1_10;Mammalian collectins play key roles in innate immunity, health and disease. These have been well studied in humans and other mammalian species, but much has still to be learned about the bovine collectins and the role they may play in the health and disease in cattle which have significant economic implications to the agricultural and food industries. This chapter focuses on the bovine collectins, which are important innate immune molecules and play a key role in immunoregulation and protection against pathogens. Like other mammalian collectins, they all have a related structure comprised of an N-terminal triple-helical collagen-like region and a ligand binding C-terminal C-type lectin domain. The bovine collectins are able to recognise and bind to complex glycoconjugates, particularly on the surface of microbes, neutralising infection, enhancing clearance by phagocytes and modulating immune response. Here, we will review the bovine collectins, surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D), mannose binding lectins (MBL-A and MBL-C), conglutinin (CGN), collectin 43 (CL-43) and collectin 46 (CL-46), and their role in bovine immunity and disease. We will particularly focus on the structural, functional and anti-microbial roles of these collectins with an additional focus on genetic polymorphisms in their genes and predisposition to infectious diseases in the bovine host. In the absence of specific data on the bovine host, findings from studies with other mammalian collectins will be discussed with respect to bovine health and disease.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972501/;13/03/2021;conglutinin;0.9881
275;Limitations of the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale as outcome measure for clinical trials and a roadmap for improvement;10.1007/s10286-021-00782-w;PURPOSE: The unified multiple system atrophy (MSA) rating scale (UMSARS) was developed almost 20 years ago as a clinical rating scale to capture multiple aspects of the disease. With its widespread use, the shortcomings of the UMSARS as a clinical outcome assessment (COA) have become increasingly apparent. We here summarize the shortcomings of the scale, confirm some of its limitations with data from the Natural History Study of the Synucleinopathies (NHSS), and suggest a framework to develop and validate an improved COA to be used in future clinical trials of disease-modifying drugs in patients with MSA. METHODS: Expert consensus assessment of the limitations of the UMSARS and recommendations for the development and validation of a novel COA for MSA. We used UMSARS data from the ongoing NHSS (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01799915) to showcase some of these limitations. RESULTS: The UMSARS in general, and specific items in particular, have limitations to detect change resulting in a ceiling effect. Some items have specific limitations including unclear anchoring descriptions, lack of correlation with disease severity, susceptibility to improve with symptomatic therapies (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, constipation, and bladder dysfunction), and redundancy, among others. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the limitations of the UMSARS, developing and validating an improved COA is a priority. The time is right for academic MSA clinicians together with industry, professional societies, and patient advocacy groups to develop and validate a new COA.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10286-021-00782-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33554315/";07/02/2021;clinical outcome assessment;0.9079
276;Effects of qigong on systolic and diastolic blood pressure lowering: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis;10.1186/s12906-020-03172-3;"BACKGROUND: The benefits of qigong for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) reduction have been noted in previously published systematic reviews; however, the data on its effectiveness has been at best scarce. We aimed to update the evidence of qigong on blood pressure reduction after taking into consideration the risks of random error and reliability of data in the cumulative meta-analysis using trial sequential analysis (TSA). METHODS: Included trials were assessed using Cochrane risk of bias instrument. We performed meta-analysis with random-effects model and random errors were evaluated with TSA. We performed the search for the eligible randomized controlled trial (RCT) through Medline, Cinahl, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and also PubMed. RESULTS: A total of 370 subjects sourced from seven eligible RCTs were entered into the analysis. The pooled results demonstrated the significant reduction with the use of qigong of the systolic blood pressure [weighted mean difference (WMD), − 10.66 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) = − 17.69,-3.62, p < 0.001] and diastolic BP [WMD, − 6.76 mmHg, 95% CI = − 12.22, − 1.30, p < 0.001] as compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Significant reductions in BP is seen with the use of qigong as compared with the control group, suggesting that qigong may be used as a complementary therapy in the somewhat complicated management of hypertension.

277;Occupational stress, mental health, and self-efficacy among community mental health workers: A cross-sectional study during COVID-19 pandemic.;10.1177/0020764020972131;BACKGROUND During the COVID-19, community mental health care workers (CMHWs) faced much heavier workloads, which make them vulnerable to mental problems. AIM This study aims to investigate coronavirus disease-related occupational stress and its single and cumulative effect on mental health and self-efficacy among CMHWs. METHODS A quick-response online cross-sectional survey WA conducted during the coronavirus disease outbreak. A total of 536 CMHWs were recruited in March 2020, in China. Demographics, occupational stress, depression, anxiety, positive and negative emotions, and self-efficacy were collected. Logistic regression analysis was employed to test the single and cumulative effect of occupational stress on mental health and self-efficacy. RESULTS CMHWs did not show high level of depression or anxiety in this study. Those who provided service for suspected people who were quarantined reported higher risk of depression and anxiety. Staying out for more than 3 days was a risk factor of depression while cleaning/sterilising streets or communities was a protective factor of depression. Those who received psychiatric training showed higher positive emotion and self-efficacy, and providing psychological assistance online increased the self-efficacy. CMHWs with two different types of work had 0.996 times more risk of depression than those with only one type of work. CONCLUSION The potential cumulative effect of occupation stress suggested that reasonable job assignment and organisational support are necessary safeguards for CMHWs.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020972131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33176527/";11/11/2020;community mental health care workers;0.9219
278;Early antiviral treatment contributes to alleviate the severity and improve the prognosis of patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).;10.1111/joim.13063;"BACKGROUND At present, the severity of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a focal point. METHODS To assess the factors associated with severity and prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed 280 cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from January 20 to February 20, 2020. RESULTS The median age of patients in the mild group was 37.55 years old, while that in the severe group was 63.04 years old. The proportion of patients over 65 years old in the severe group was significantly higher than that of the mild group (59.04% vs. 10.15%, P < 0.05). 85.54% of severe patients had diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, which was significantly higher than that of the mild group (51.81% vs 7.11%, P = 0.025; 33.73% vs 3.05%, P = 0.042). Patients in the mild group experienced earlier initiation of antiviral treatment (1.19 ± 0.45 vs 2.65 ± 1.06 days in the severe group, P < 0.001). Our study showed that comorbidity, time from illness onset to antiviral, and age >=65 were three major risk factors for COVID-19 progression, while comorbidity and time from illness onset to antiviral were two major risk factors for COVID-19 recovery. CONCLUSIONS The elderly and patients with underlying diseases are more likely to experience a severe progression of COVID-19. It is recommended that timely antiviral treatment should be initiated to slow the disease progression and improve the prognosis.";"https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.13063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32220033/";27/03/2020;novel coronavirus disease;0.9368
279;Can Clinical Symptoms and Laboratory Results Predict CT Abnormality? Initial Findings Using Novel Machine Learning Techniques in Children With COVID-19 Infections;10.3389/fmed.2021.699984;The rapid spread of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has manifested a global public health crisis, and chest CT has been proven to be a powerful tool for screening, triage, evaluation and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. However, CT is not only costly but also associated with an increased incidence of cancer, in particular for children. This study will question whether clinical symptoms and laboratory results can predict the CT outcomes for the pediatric patients with positive RT-PCR testing results in order to determine the necessity of CT for such a vulnerable group. Clinical data were collected from 244 consecutive pediatric patients (16 years of age and under) treated at Wuhan Children's Hospital with positive RT-PCR testing, and the chest CT were performed within 3 days of clinical data collection, from January 21 to March 8, 2020. This study was approved by the local ethics committee of Wuhan Children's Hospital. Advanced decision tree based machine learning models were developed for the prediction of CT outcomes. Results have shown that age, lymphocyte, neutrophils, ferritin and C-reactive protein are the most related clinical indicators for predicting CT outcomes for pediatric patients with positive RT-PCR testing. Our decision support system has managed to achieve an AUC of 0.84 with 0.82 accuracy and 0.84 sensitivity for predicting CT outcomes. Our model can effectively predict CT outcomes, and our findings have indicated that the use of CT should be reconsidered for pediatric patients, as it may not be indispensable.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195215/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.699984";14/06/2021;coronavirus 2019 disease;0.9681
280;Novel Immunomodulatory Therapies for Respiratory Pathologies;10.1016/b978-0-12-820472-6.00073-6;"The respiratory tract is constantly exposed to environmental aggressions including allergens, infections, and pollution. The immune system is pivotal to fight potential invaders and prevent the establishment of infections in the respiratory tract; however, excessive, misplaced or altered immune responses contribute to increase tissue damage, impair lung function, and exacerbate respiratory diseases. Indeed, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis are respiratory diseases that have uncontrolled inflammation as a unifying severity factor. In addition, the acute inflammatory responses in pneumonia must be controlled to avoid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can be lethal. In this regard, immunomodulatory therapies are promising pharmacological strategies to treat important respiratory pathologies. Understanding the pathogenesis of respiratory disorders have paved the way for the development of cytokine-directed therapies, allosteric or non-allosteric inhibitors of inflammatory receptors and enzymes, agonists of resolution of inflammation and other anti-inflammatory compounds. A multitude of studies have evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of several molecules that target inflammation in the respiratory tract, yet only few have been translated to clinical use. This article will summarize important aspects of asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia focusing on the role of immune responses in disease development and novel immunomodulatory therapies.";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128204726000736; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128204726000736";28/06/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9158
281;Inhaled RNA Therapeutics for Obstructive Airway Diseases: Recent Advances and Future Prospects;10.3390/pharmaceutics13020177;Obstructive airway diseases, e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, represent leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the efficacy of currently available inhaled therapeutics is not sufficient for arresting disease progression and decreasing mortality, hence providing an urgent need for development of novel therapeutics. Local delivery to the airways via inhalation is promising for novel drugs, because it allows for delivery directly to the target site of action and minimizes systemic drug exposure. In addition, novel drug modalities like RNA therapeutics provide entirely new opportunities for highly specific treatment of airway diseases. Here, we review state of the art of conventional inhaled drugs used for the treatment of COPD and asthma with focus on quality attributes of inhaled medicines, and we outline the therapeutic potential and safety of novel drugs. Subsequently, we present recent advances in manufacturing of thermostable solid dosage forms for pulmonary administration, important quality attributes of inhalable dry powder formulations, and obstacles for the translation of inhalable solid dosage forms to the clinic. Delivery challenges for inhaled RNA therapeutics and delivery technologies used to overcome them are also discussed. Finally, we present future prospects of novel inhaled RNA-based therapeutics for treatment of obstructive airways diseases, and highlight major knowledge gaps, which require further investigation to advance RNA-based medicine towards the bedside.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525500/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13020177";28/01/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9721
282;Pedestrian wind comfort near a super-tall building with various configurations in an urban-like setting;10.1007/s12273-020-0658-6;Pedestrian wind comfort near a 400 m super-tall building in high and low ambient wind speeds, referred to as Windy and Calm climates, is evaluated by conducting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The super-tall building has 15 different configurations and is located at the center of 50 m medium-rise buildings in an urban-like setting. Pedestrian level mean wind speeds near the super-tall building is obtained from three-dimensional (3D), steady-state, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)-based simulations for five incident wind directions (θ = 0°, 22.5°, 45°, 90°, 180°) that are subsequently compared with two wind comfort criteria specified for Calm and Windy climates. Results show a 1.53 times increase in maximum mean wind speed in the urban area after the construction of a square-shaped super-tall building. The escalated mean wind speeds result in a 23%–15% and 36%–29% decrease in the area with “acceptable wind comfort” in Calm and Windy climates, respectively. The area with pedestrian wind comfort varies significantly with building configuration and incident wind direction, for example, the configurations with sharp corners, large plan aspect ratios and, frontal areas and the orientation consistently show a strong dependency on incident wind direction except for the one with rounded plan shapes. Minor aerodynamic modifications such as corner modifications and aerodynamically-shaped configurations such as tapered and setback buildings show promise in improving pedestrian wind comfort in Windy climate.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282207/;09/06/2020;computational fluid dynamics;0.972
283;Breast Cancer Screening and the COVID-19 Pandemic;10.1093/jbi/wbaa106;The novel SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a major impact on breast radiology practices. Initially, nonessential imaging studies, including screening mammography, were curtailed and even temporarily halted when lockdowns were instituted in many parts of the United States. As a result, imaging volumes plummeted while health care institutions worked to ensure safety measures were in place to protect patients and personnel. As COVID-19 infection levels started to stabilize in some areas, breast radiology practices sought guidance from national organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and radiology specialty societies, to develop strategies for patients to safely return for screening mammograms and other outpatient imaging studies. Postponement of breast cancer screening has led to delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment that could negatively affect patient outcomes for years to come. In order to continue to provide necessary imaging services, breast radiologists will need to face and overcome ongoing practical challenges related to the pandemic, such as negative financial impacts on practices and patients, the need for modifications in delivery of imaging services and trainee education, and differences in the health care system as a whole, including the shift to telehealth for clinical care. Nonetheless, despite the disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, the need for breast radiology procedures, including breast cancer screening, remains strong.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798968/;24/12/2020;SARS-CoV2;0.9386
284;One-Pass Conversion of Benzene and Syngas to Alkylbenzenes by Cu–ZnO–Al(2)O(3) and ZSM-5 Relay;10.1007/s10562-021-03617-5;Alkylbenzenes have a wide range of uses and are the most demanded aromatic chemicals. The finite petroleum resources compels the development of production of alkylbenzenes by non-petroleum routes. One-pass selective conversion of benzene and syngas to alkylbenzenes is a promising alternative coal chemical engineering route, yet it still faces challenge to industrialized applications owing to low conversion of benzene and syngas. Here we presented a Cu–ZnO–Al(2)O(3)/ZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst which realizes one-pass conversion of benzene and syngas to alkylbenzenes with high efficiency. This bifunctional catalyst exhibited high benzene conversion (benzene conversion of 50.7%), CO conversion (CO conversion of 55.0%) and C7&C8 aromatics total yield (C7&C8 total yield of 45.0%). Characterizations and catalytic performance evaluations revealed that ZSM-5 with well-regulated acidity, as a vital part of this Cu–ZnO–Al(2)O(3)/ZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst, substantially contributed to its performance for the alkylbenzenes one-pass synthesis from benzene and syngas due to depress methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction. Furthermore, matching of the mass ratio of two active components in the dual-function catalyst and the temperature of methanol synthesis with benzene alkylation reactions can effectively depress the formation of unwanted by-products and guarantee the high performance of tandem reactions.

285;A review of cardiac manifestations and predictors of outcome in patients with COVID – 19;10.1016/j.hrtlng.2020.04.019;Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has so far involved 184 countries and more than 2.79 million patients worldwide. Over the past three months, it has attributed to more than 196, 000 deaths, with more than 50, 000 deaths in the United States alone. Pulmonary manifestations are predominant and have been well identified. Cardiac involvement is also common. Acute cardiac injury, the most common cardiac manifestation of this disease can be seen in patients even without prior cardiac comorbidities. Established cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease predispose to cardiac injury, the severity of illness and mortality. Non-ischemic myocardial injury secondary to cytokine storm is thought to be the predominant mechanism of acute cardiac injury associated with COVID-19. Multiple mechanisms and processes contribute to cardiac injury resulting in a poor outcome. Some of these are not clearly understood. Clinical and diagnostic details of cardiovascular involvement in these patients are mostly limited to biochemical markers. Multiple therapeutic agents have been tried with questionable efficacy and without clinical evidence. Interactions of comorbidities, cardiovascular drugs, the cardiac effect of therapeutic agents on the illness continue to be under investigation. With an increasing number of patients, newer promising therapies, and ongoing clinical trials, the exact mechanisms and extent to which these risk factors contribute to outcomes will be clearer in the future.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2020.04.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147956320301576; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956320301576?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32593418/";03/05/2020;Abstract Coronavirus disease;0.9751

To better understand the mechanism of the neutralization activity against HCMV, the association of HCMV NT antibody titers was assessed with the antibody titers against each glycoprotein complex (gc) of HCMV. METHODS: Sera collected from 78 healthy adult volunteers were used. HCMV Merlin strain and HCMV clinical isolate strain 1612 were used in the NT assay with the plaque reduction assay, in which both the MRC-5 fibroblasts cells and the RPE-1 epithelial cells were used. Glycoprotein complex of gB, gH/gL complexes (gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128–131A [PC]) and gM/gN were selected as target glycoproteins. 293FT cells expressed with gB, gM/gN, gH/gL/gO, or PC, were prepared and used for the measurement of the antibody titers against each gc in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). The correlation between the IIFA titers to each gc and the HCMV-NT titers was evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant correlations between gB-specific IIFA titers and the HCMV-NT titers in epithelial cells or between gM/gN complex-specific IIFA titers and the HCMV-NT titers. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the IIFA titers to gH/gL complexes and HCMV-NT titers. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the gH/gL complexes might be the major target to induce NT activity against HCMV.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7397426/;03/08/2020;Human cytomegalovirus;0.9731
287;Queers in Quarantines: Impact of Lockdown and Social Distancing on Psychology of Transgender;10.1007/s40031-021-00586-6;The unexpected emergence of a novel and dangerous virus widely known as coronavirus (COVID-19) has brought in global health crisis and has socioeconomically disrupted the lives of people to a significant extent. In order to curb the spread of the contagious infection, nationwide lockdown and sometimes shutdown is announced by the state which has adversely affected the lives of many members of transgender community who are solely dependent on social interactions for their livelihood such as begging in streets and trains, entertaining in marriage functions and baby showers, engaging in prostitution. Consequently, the lost livelihood, clogged income stream, exhausted savings, burden of debt have imbued psychological distress among them. This study has analyzed the association of social distancing and lockdown constraints to psychological outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety issues, financial stress, lack of social support, and loneliness) among transgender people amid COVID-19. Transgender participants (N = 150, mean age = 42.5) were selected through snowball sampling from India who responded to the questionnaire through both online platform and offline modes. Findings show that there is positive association between any two of the variables and the degree of association is quite reasonable with the range from 0.534 to 0.945. Further, in order to evaluate the hypothesis a series of regression analysis is conducted.

289;Ageing and dementia: age-period-cohort effects of policy intervention in England, 2006–2016;10.1186/s12877-021-02341-4;BACKGROUND: Dementia is one of the most critical challenges of our time. According to the Dementia Statistics Hub, only about 66 % of all UK residents with dementia were diagnosed in 2017–2018. Yet, there are reservations about the early diagnosis of dementia-related diseases. As a result, the UK National Screening Committee does not recommend systematic population screening of dementia, although case-finding strategies are still applied for high-risk groups. METHODS: This study added additional evidence of the effectiveness of the National Dementia Strategy and increased numbers of diagnosis of dementia on the younger cohorts of the older people, using the intrinsic estimator age-period-cohort (APC) models and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing data. RESULTS: Age effects show that diagnosis increases in volume only among those aged 75 and above, suggesting that many of those aged below 75 might not be diagnosed in time. Period effects show that although there was an initial increase due to the new policy implementation, the trend stalled in later years, indicating that the increase might not have been even across the period when controlled for age and cohort. The study also shows that cohort effects indicate lower prevalence in younger cohorts controlled for age and period effects. CONCLUSIONS: Although more research in diverse contexts is warranted, this study cautions against the abandonment of timely diagnosis, increased screening and case-finding, and shows some effectiveness of prevention strategies on the national level.;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02341-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174814/";26/06/2021;Dementia;0.9079
290;Implications of COVID-19 on Gaming, Leisure and Entertainment Industry;10.1007/978-3-030-56231-1_12;The global entertainment sector is a multibillion-dollar economy whose size surpasses several countries’ annual domestic gross product. Regardless of the significance of this sector, it is often an under-researched branch of the tourism industry. For example, there is barely a study on how the previous epidemics and pandemics affected this critical sector. This study, therefore, investigates the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on entertainment (music, television and special events). Using archival and secondary data from authoritative sources, the study showed that the impact of the pandemic was devastating on the sector, leading to multibillion-dollar losses for global entertainment companies. Global entertainment companies such as Walt Disney World and Box Office suffered massive losses, which forced several companies to furlough employees and executives in the battle for survival and to protect capital. The study also showed that the pandemic disrupted both the demand side and the supply side of business in the entertainment sector, which resulted in cancellations of festivals and film production at a time of surging demand for entertainment. Given the nature of the pandemic, 2020 proved to be a challenging year for many entertainment companies – a situation likely to play out for the next 2–3 years as companies battle to recover. The study recommends a post-pandemic assessment of each segment of the sector to allow it to build a disaster preparedness and management system, which does not seem to be in place at the moment.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980030/;15/07/2020;coronavirus;0.9577
291;Prevalence, incidence and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult coeliac patients.;10.1097/meg.0000000000001969;OBJECTIVES Data on SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) in adult coeliac disease (CD) are lacking. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19 in adult coeliac patients regularly followed-up at our centre since January 2015. METHODS Data about general health status and clinical features of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were prospectively collected over the phone. Data about CD were retrospectively collected from clinical notes. Prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 were compared between the coeliac cohort and the figures in the general population of Lombardy, Northern Italy between 20 February to 5 June 2020 provided by the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità) and the Lombardy regional government. RESULTS Nine out of 324 patients contracted COVID-19, thus resulting in a prevalence of 2.78% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-4.58] and an incidence rate of 8.15/1000 person-month (95% CI 4.24-15.66). Prevalence of COVID-19 ascertained by means of nasal swab was 1.79% (95% CI 0.22-3.35) and the incidence rate 5.26/1000 person-month (95% CI 2.19-12.63), without difference from the general population. Clinical type of CD, age, sex, duration and adherence to a gluten-free diet, and mucosal healing did not differ between coeliac patients with and without COVID-19. None of the 9 patients with COVID-19 required hospitalization. CONCLUSION Patients with CD do not seem to carry an increased risk of COVID-19 compared to the general population and their disease course is mild.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000001969; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399400/";04/01/2021;SARS-CoV-2 disease;0.953
292;Deviation of the centre of rotation of the femoral head in dysplastic hip joints.;10.1007/s00590-020-02769-1;OBJECTIVE Hip instability may be based not only on some mismatch between the size of the femoral head and acetabulum but also on the deviation of the centre of rotation of the femoral head. The aim of this study was to compare the differences between the centre of rotation of the femoral head and that of the acetabulum in normal and dysplastic hips. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty dysplastic hips and 30 control hips without dysplastic hip were included in this study. Computed tomography data were imported into three-dimensional analysis software. The sphere radius of the acetabulum, the sphere radius of the femoral head, and the deviation of the centre of rotation of the femoral head from that of the acetabulum were analysed. RESULTS The sphere radii of the acetabulum and femoral head were significantly larger in dysplastic hips. Distances between the centre of rotation of the acetabulum and that of the femoral head were significantly larger in dysplastic group than in control group. The centre of rotation of the femoral head was significantly deviated anterosuperiorly in dysplastic hips. We found significant negative correlations between centre-edge angle and the distance between the centre of rotation of the acetabulum and that of the femoral head in all subjects. CONCLUSION In dysplastic hip joints, the centre of rotation of the femoral head was more deviated anterosuperiorly from that of the acetabulum than in normal hip joints even in static condition, which might be clinically associated with the micro-instability in dysplastic hips.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00590-020-02769-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079287/";20/10/2020;control group;0.958
293;Can medication mitigate the need for a strict lock down?: A mathematical study of control strategies for COVID-19 infection;10.1101/2020.05.29.20116749;We formulate a deterministic epidemic model to study the effects of medication on the transmission dynamics of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). We are especially interested in how the availability of medication could change the necessary quarantine measures for effective control of the disease. We model the transmission by extending the SEIR model to include asymptomatic, quarantined, isolated and medicated population compartments. We calculate the basic reproduction number R_0 and show that for R_0<1 the disease dies out and for R_0>1 the disease is endemic. Using sensitivity analysis we establish that R_0 is most sensitive to the rates of quarantine and medication. We also study how the effectiveness and the rate of medication along with the quarantine rate affect R_0. We devise optimal quarantine, medication and isolation strategies, noting that availability of medication reduces the duration and severity of the lock-down needed for effective disease control. Our study also reinforces the idea that with the availability of medication, while the severity of the lock downs can be eased over time some social distancing protocols need to be observed, at least till a vaccine is found. We also analyze the COVID-109 outbreak data for four different countries, in two of these, India and Pakistan the curve is still rising, and in he other two, Italy and Spain, the epidemic curve is now falling due to effective quarantine measures. We provide estimates of R_0 and the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population for these countries.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.29.20116749; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.29.20116749v1?rss=1";29/05/2020;Corona Virus Disease;0.9507
294;SARS-CoV-2-Encoded Proteome and Human Genetics: From Interaction-Based to Ribosomal Biology Impact on Disease and Risk Processes;10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00421;[Image: see text] SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has infected millions of people worldwide, with lethality in hundreds of thousands. The rapid publication of information, both regarding the clinical course and the viral biology, has yielded incredible knowledge of the virus. In this review, we address the insights gained for the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, which we have integrated into the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database, a publicly available resource. Integrating evolutionary, structural, and interaction data with human proteins, we present how the SARS-CoV-2 proteome interacts with human disorders and risk factors ranging from cytokine storm, hyperferritinemic septic, coagulopathic, cardiac, immune, and rare disease-based genetics. The most noteworthy human genetic potential of SARS-CoV-2 is that of the nucleocapsid protein, where it is known to contribute to the inhibition of the biological process known as nonsense-mediated decay. This inhibition has the potential to not only regulate about 10% of all biological transcripts through altered ribosomal biology but also associate with viral-induced genetics, where suppressed human variants are activated to drive dominant, negative outcomes within cells. As we understand more of the dynamic and complex biological pathways that the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 utilizes for entry into cells, for replication, and for release from human cells, we can understand more risk factors for severe/lethal outcomes in patients and novel pharmaceutical interventions that may mitigate future pandemics.;"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32686937/";20/07/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9884
295;Effects of Infection with SARS-CoV-2 on the Male and Female Reproductive Systems: A Review.;10.12659/msm.930168;Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading pandemic that began at the end of 2019. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Reproductive health has always been one of the most important healthcare problems, and the impacts of COVID-19 on the reproductive systems have become an emerging topic. The effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2 on males are more harmful than on females. The outcomes of pregnancy also can show the condition of male and female reproductive system health. The vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 significantly affects pregnancy healthy. SARS-CoV-2, antibody, and other factors, such as the decline of lymphocyte counts, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels, are evidence of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is regarded as a virus receptor in the reproductive system. The expression and activity of ACE2 are influenced by sex hormones, especially the male sex hormones. The strength of immunity is crucial to fighting off viral infection. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 show different expression in male and female patients, and the antibodies have been regarded as having potential applications in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. This review aims to present the current status of what is known about the involvement of the male and female reproductive systems, as well as the effects on pregnancy health, during infection with SARS-CoV-2, and discusses the implications for future fertility.;"https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.930168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34193809/";01/07/2021;Coronavirus Disease-2019;0.9797
296;Multiorgan failure in a fatal case of autoimmune hemolytic anemia.;10.1111/trf.16513;BACKGROUND Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) results in red blood cell destruction by auto-antibodies directed against surface antigens and is rarely fatal. Here we describe a case of AIHA, refractory to both standard and experimental therapies, complicated by multiorgan failure, and rapidly leading to death. CASE REPORT AND RESULTS A 65 year-old man who presented with progressive dyspnea and jaundice was found to have hemolytic anemia. Diagnostic work-up revealed a positive direct antiglobulin test and a strong pan-reactive antibody in the plasma reacting to a titer of 1:1024 with strongest reactivity at 37 °C Coombs' phase with reagent anti-IgG. The red cell eluate contained a pan-agglutinin. The patient received multiple lines of treatment including glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, eculizumab, splenectomy and etoposide. Despite these interventions, he continued to experience brisk hemolysis and remained transfusion dependent. Repeat testing on day 16 demonstrated persistent high titer IgG auto-antibodies, suggesting minimal suppressive effect of therapy. His course was complicated by acute renal and liver failure, venous thrombosis, and worsening coagulopathy, and he ultimately died from multiorgan failure on day 18. CONCLUSION Severe cases of AIHA can result in multiorgan failure and a fatal outcome. The rapid development of liver failure in this setting has been described in only few case reports to date, and represents an important complication for clinicians to be aware of when treating patients with AIHA.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046911/";27/05/2021;Autoimmune hemolytic anemia;0.9215
297;Developmental exposure to near roadway pollution produces behavioral phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders in juvenile rats.;10.1038/s41398-020-00978-0;"Epidemiological studies consistently implicate traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and/or proximity to heavily trafficked roads as risk factors for developmental delays and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs); however, there are limited preclinical data demonstrating a causal relationship. To test the effects of TRAP, pregnant rat dams were transported to a vivarium adjacent to a major freeway tunnel system in northern California where they were exposed to TRAP drawn directly from the face of the tunnel or filtered air (FA). Offspring remained housed under the exposure condition into which they were born and were tested in a variety of behavioral assays between postnatal day 4 and 50. To assess the effects of near roadway exposure, offspring of dams housed in a standard research vivarium were tested at the laboratory. An additional group of dams was transported halfway to the facility and then back to the laboratory to control for the effect of potential transport stress. Near roadway exposure delayed growth and development of psychomotor reflexes and elicited abnormal activity in open field locomotion. Near roadway exposure also reduced isolation-induced 40-kHz pup ultrasonic vocalizations, with the TRAP group having the lowest number of call emissions. TRAP affected some components of social communication, evidenced by reduced neonatal pup ultrasonic calling and altered juvenile reciprocal social interactions. These findings confirm that living in close proximity to highly trafficked roadways during early life alters neurodevelopment.";"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00978-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807767/";17/08/2020;neurodevelopmental disorders;0.982

Braiding knowledges (Atalay, 2012) from Nbisiing Anishinaabeg communities, northern Ontario universities, and multi-scalar museums, the partnership focuses on repatriation, reparative environmental histories, and action-based research in the context of settler colonialism and climate change. We reflect on ongoing projects that attempt to put Anishinaabe gikendaasowin (knowledge) into action alongside historical geographical research. We discuss how the partnership resonates with community geography values of relationship, collaboration, equity, and reciprocity, and urge non-Indigenous geographers to acknowledge how Indigenous knowledges and approaches have shaped these ideas long before geography became a discipline. We contend that historical geographers have a deeper role to play in community geography scholarship, citing examples of two projects related to (1) repatriation of Anishinaabeg cultural heritage and (2) storymapping through historical Geographic Information Systems (HGIS). However, we argue, geographers must continue to acknowledge their own positionality in a discipline that was built through settler colonial violence and knowledge production. Finally, we reflect on the role of academic institutions in facilitating First Nation-university-museum partnerships through access to funding, space, and databases, while addressing the challenges of relying on institutional support for reparatory and decolonizing projects.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967375/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10432-3";04/05/2021;historical Geographic Information Systems;0.9408
299;Resident interstitial lung fibroblasts and their role in alveolar stem cell niche development, homeostasis, injury, and regeneration;10.1002/sctm.20-0526;Developing, regenerating, and repairing a lung all require interstitial resident fibroblasts (iReFs) to direct the behavior of the epithelial stem cell niche. During lung development, distal lung fibroblasts, in the form of matrix‐, myo‐, and lipofibroblasts, form the extra cellular matrix (ECM), create tensile strength, and support distal epithelial differentiation, respectively. During de novo septation in a murine pneumonectomy lung regeneration model, developmental processes are reactivated within the iReFs, indicating progenitor function well into adulthood. In contrast to the regenerative activation of fibroblasts upon acute injury, chronic injury results in fibrotic activation. In murine lung fibrosis models, fibroblasts can pathologically differentiate into lineages beyond their normal commitment during homeostasis. In lung injury, recently defined alveolar niche cells support the expansion of alveolar epithelial progenitors to regenerate the epithelium. In human fibrotic lung diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dynamic changes in matrix‐, myo‐, lipofibroblasts, and alveolar niche cells suggest differential requirements for injury pathogenesis and repair. In this review, we summarize the role of alveolar fibroblasts and their activation stage in alveolar septation and regeneration and incorporate them into the context of human lung disease, discussing fibroblast activation stages and how they contribute to BPD, IPF, and COPD.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.20-0526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33624948/";24/02/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9787

OBJECTIVE: The current document represents a recent update in the Indian context, regarding unit design, equipment, organization, staffing as well as admission and discharge criteria for different levels of Pediatric Intensive Care and teaching units with PICU training programs, as well as nonteaching units. PROCESS: The Pediatric Intensive Care College Council (PICC), an academic wing of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) Intensive Care Chapter took the initiative to update the guidelines with members of the PICU guidelines Committee writing group. After a great deal of discussion at conferences and through mailing and feedback with listed members, as well as with the guidance and feedback of senior PICU guidelines advisory committee members, The consensus is now updated. These guidelines are intended to serve as a reference for health Care institutions wishing to establish a new PICU or to modify an existing PICU. As a resource, experience of those members who have worked extensively in western PICUs was also taken into consideration, in addition to published guidelines in the medical literature. PICUs with teaching programs run by the IAP Intensive Care Chapter must follow these criteria for unit accreditation and teaching curricula as applicable. RECOMMENDATIONS: Unit design, equipment, organization, staffing as well as admission and discharge criteria for different levels of pediatric intensive care are updated.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7678571/;29/08/2020;Consensus Guidelines for Pediatric Intensive Care Units;0.9509
301;"""I Could Not Manage This Long-Term, Absolutely Not."" Aging in Place, Informal Care, COVID-19, and the Neighborhood in Flanders (Belgium).";10.3390/ijerph18126482;Public health and care policies across OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries increasingly encourage aging in place, enabled by both formal care networks, and informal (family) care and social solidarity in the neighborhood. However, little is known about how a person's neighborhood might affect their aging in place. The COVID-19 crisis unintendedly offered a good opportunity to observe the neighborhood's role in the provision of care. Since formal care services were often limited during the lockdown, informal caregiving may have increased. However, intergenerational contacts in and outside of the household were strongly discouraged by governments worldwide, adding another layer of complexity to caregiving. The aim of this qualitative study was to assess how informal caregivers in Flanders managed to provide care to their care receivers, and what role the neighborhood played in this provision of care. Sixteen qualitative Skype and telephone interviews with informal caregivers were conducted between June and December 2020 to understand their experiences and coping strategies. Overall, most respondents increased their frequency of caregiving during the first lockdown. They took on the extra care needs during the lockdown themselves, and did not actively invoke any kind of neighborhood support. The significance of the neighborhood seemingly remained limited. This was often not because no help was offered, but rather due to a sense of pride or the fear of infection, and an increased effort by family caregivers.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208493/";16/06/2021;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development;0.979
302;The effects of the miR-21/SMAD7/TGF-β pathway on Th17 cell differentiation in COPD.;10.1038/s41598-021-85637-0;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease with multiple etiologies, while smoking is the most established one. The present study investigated the modulation of T-helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation by the miR-21/Smad7/TGF-β pathway, and their roles in COPD. Lung tissues were obtained from lung cancer patients with or without COPD who underwent lobotomy and the levels of miR-21, TGF-β/Smad signaling molecules, RORγT, and other Th17-related cytokines were detected. Mouse COPD models were built by exposing both wild-type (WT) and miR-21-/- mice to cigarette smoke (CS) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) intraperitoneal injection. Isolated primary CD4+ T cells were treated with either CS extract, miR-21 mimics or inhibitors, followed by measuring Th17 cells markers and the expression of TGF-β/Smad signaling molecules and RORγT. Increased levels of miR-21, Smad7, phosphorylated (p)-Smad2, p-Smad3, TGF-β, and Th17-related cytokines was detected in the lungs of COPD patients. Lung function in modeled WT mice, but not miR-21-/- ones, deteriorated and the number of inflammatory cells in the lung tissues increased compared to the control WT-mice. Moreover, primary CD4+ lymphocytes tend to differentiate into Th17 cells after the treatment with CSE or miR-21 mimics, and the expression of RORγT and the TGF-β/Smad signaling were all increased, however miR-21 inhibitors worked reversely. Our findings demonstrated that Th17 cells increased under COPD pathogenesis and was partially modulated by the miR-21/Smad7/TGF-β pathway.;"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85637-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739023/";18/03/2021;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9621

We investigated an association between delay in radical prostatectomy (RP) and oncological outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective review of men with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer (PC) in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) underdoing radical prostatectomy from 2010-2016. Immediate RP was defined as RP within 3-months of diagnosis, while delayed RP was analyzed in 3-month intervals up to 12-months. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed RP and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on RP, node positive disease, and post-RP secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate RP. RESULTS We identified 128,062 men with intermediate- and high-risk PC treated with RP. After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease, or post-RP secondary treatments between men treated with immediate RP and any level of delay up to 12 months. Subgroup analysis of men with Grade group 4 and 5 PC did not demonstrate an association between delayed RP and worse oncological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS In the NCDB, delayed RP was not associated with early adverse oncological outcomes at RP.

304;Systemic thrombolysis and anticoagulation improved biomarker measurements in massive-like pulmonary embolism and severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a case report;10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa448;BACKGROUND: From asymptomatic patients to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, COVID-19 has a wide range of clinical presentations, and venous thromboembolism has emerged as a critical and frequent complication. CASE SUMMARY: We present a case of a 69-year-old man with a clinical presentation of massive-like pulmonary embolism (PE) overlapping with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The diagnosis was made based on hypotension, severe oxygen desaturation (33%), and right ventricular dysfunction (RVD). We used alteplase and low-molecular-weight heparin, obtaining immediate clinical improvement. Also, we identified an extremely elevated D-dimer (31.2 mcg/mL), and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) revealed an unexpected low thrombus burden and a crazy-paving pattern. Considering this, we decided to discontinue the alteplase. Therefore, the mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension and RVD could be multifactorial. Despite the patient’s respiratory status worsening and ongoing mechanical ventilation, biomarkers kept lowering to normal ranges. It appears a favourable outcome was related to early PE diagnosis and a multimodal therapeutic approach. DISCUSSION: Physicians in the ER should be warned about extremely high D-dimer measurements and severe oxygen desaturation as possible markers of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with high-clinical suspicion of PE. Although ESC guidelines recommend immediate reperfusion in cardiogenic shock secondary to PE, we suggest initial CTPA in patients with high-clinical suspicion of severe COVID-19.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33634226/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa448";13/12/2020;From asymptomatic patients to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome;0.9283

Medical students are notorious for insufficient and irregular sleep habits which are linked with students' learning abilities, poor academic performance, and poor interpersonal relationship which predispose them to mental illnesses. However, it has not been studied among medical students in Ethiopia. METHOD: This institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 576 undergraduate medical students selected by using a stratified sampling technique. Sleep hygiene (SHI) was assessed by a 13-item sleep hygiene questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the potential determinants of poor sleep hygiene among undergraduate medical students. Variables with p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and the strength of the association was presented by adjusted odds ratio with 95% C.I. RESULT: The prevalence of poor sleep hygiene practice among undergraduate medical students was 48.1% (95% 43.7, 52.1). After adjusting for the possible confounders, being female (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.03, 2.26), having depressive symptoms (AOR = 3.55, 95% CI 2.26, 5.59), with stress symptoms (AOR = 2.41, 95% CI 1.61, 3.60), and having anxiety symptoms (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.42, 3.31) were associated with poor sleep hygiene practice at p value < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Almost half of the medical students had poor sleep hygiene practice.

One group significantly affected both educationally and psychosocially is college students, as they experienced an abrupt cancellation of in-person courses, were forced to leave their dormitories, and witnessed a loss of social activities. Method: This study utilizes survey data from college students in the throes of COVID-19-based home schooling collected for a Belgium-based international study including more than 134,000 participants from 28 countries around the world. Two hundred fifty-seven college students from a U.S. university participated in this study. Results: Results indicate that college students are affected by COVID-19 on several levels, including fear of themselves or others in their social network contracting the virus, apprehension about the changes in coursework delivery and unclear instructional parameters, overall loneliness, compromised motivation, and sleep disturbances, as well as anxious and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Analyses reveal a positive relationship between academic frustrations and mental health symptoms, the latter also negatively related to trust in the government regarding the preventive measures being implemented. Worries about becoming infected were positively related to mental health symptoms and negatively related to trust in the government. Results and implications are discussed.

307;Density Functional Theory Study of Mechanisms of [8 + 2] Cycloadditions of Dienylfurans/Dienylisobenzofurans with DMAD.;10.1021/acs.joc.0c01960;The mechanisms of [8 + 2] cycloaddition reactions between dienylfurans/dienylisobenzofurans and the activated alkyne, DMAD (dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate), have been investigated by DFT calculations. The former [8 + 2] reaction is stepwise, starting from attack of the diene substituent on furan, not the furyl moiety in dienylfurans, to DMAD to give a diradical intermediate, which then undergoes ring closure to form the second bond between DMAD and the furan moiety, generating the final [8 + 2] cycloadducts. In contrast, the latter [8 + 2] reaction starts from [4 + 2] cycloaddition of the diene in the furan ring of dienylisobenzofurans toward DMAD, followed by the rate-determining stepwise [1,5]-vinyl shift, forming the [8 + 2] products. The different mechanisms of [8 + 2] reactions are attributed to the facts that for dienylfurans, the reactive diene part is the diene substituent on furan, but in the case of dienylisobenzofurans, it is the diene in the furan ring (its reaction with DMAD to generate an aromatic benzene ring is the driving force for this regiochemistry). Consequently, the [8 + 2] reactions begin with the reaction of the most reactive part of tetraene (either the diene substituent on furan for dienylfurans or the diene in the furan ring for dienylisobenzofurans) with DMAD. FMO analysis and kinetic study have been carried out to gain more information of the reaction mechanisms.

We also recorded continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) in the beluga, bottlenose dolphin, false killer whale, killer whale (Orcinus orca), and pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) to evaluate cardiorespiratory coupling while breathing spontaneously under voluntary control. The results show that cetaceans have a strong Respiratory Sinus Arrythmia (RSA), during which both f H and SV vary within the interbreath interval, making average values dependent on the breathing frequency (f R). The RSA-corrected f H was lower for all cetaceans compared to similarly sized terrestrial mammals breathing continuously. As compared with terrestrial mammals, the RSA-corrected SV and CO were either lower or the same for the dolphin and false killer whale, while both were elevated in the beluga. When plotting f R against f H for an inactive mammal, cetaceans had a greater cardiac response to changes in f R as compared with terrestrial mammals. We propose that these data indicate an important coupling between respiration and cardiac function that enhances gas exchange, and that this RSA is important to maximize gas exchange during surface intervals, similar to that reported in the elephant seal.;"https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.226365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680902/";17/07/2020;cardiac output;0.9963
309;Semen parameters in men recovered from COVID-19.;10.4103/aja.aja_31_21;The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is emerging as a global health threat and shows a higher risk for men than women. Thus far, the studies on andrological consequences of COVID-19 are limited. To ascertain the consequences of COVID-19 on sperm parameters after recovery, we recruited 41 reproductive-aged male patients who had recovered from COVID-19, and analyzed their semen parameters and serum sex hormones at a median time of 56 days after hospital discharge. For longitudinal analysis, a second sampling was obtained from 22 of the 41 patients after a median time interval of 29 days from first sampling. Compared with controls who had not suffered from COVID-19, the total sperm count, sperm concentration, and percentages of motile and progressively motile spermatozoa in the patients were significantly lower at first sampling, while sperm vitality and morphology were not affected. The total sperm count, sperm concentration, and number of motile spermatozoa per ejaculate were significantly increased and the percentage of morphologically abnormal sperm was reduced at the second sampling compared with those at first in the 22 patients examined. Though there were higher prolactin and lower progesterone levels in patients at first sampling than those in controls, no significant alterations were detected for any sex hormones examined over time following COVID-19 recovery in the 22 patients. Although it should be interpreted carefully, these findings indicate an adverse but potentially reversible consequence of COVID-19 on sperm quality.;"https://doi.org/10.4103/aja.aja_31_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33975987/";11/05/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9272
310;Sex Hormones and Lung Inflammation.;10.1007/978-3-030-68748-9_15;Inflammation is a characteristic marker in numerous lung disorders. Several immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, as well as T and B lymphocytes, synthetize and release cytokines involved in the inflammatory process. Gender differences in the incidence and severity of inflammatory lung ailments including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis (PF), lung cancer (LC), and infectious related illnesses have been reported. Moreover, the effects of sex hormones on both androgens and estrogens, such as testosterone (TES) and 17β-estradiol (E2), driving characteristic inflammatory patterns in those lung inflammatory diseases have been investigated. In general, androgens seem to display anti-inflammatory actions, whereas estrogens produce pro-inflammatory effects. For instance, androgens regulate negatively inflammation in asthma by targeting type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and T-helper (Th)-2 cells to attenuate interleukin (IL)-17A-mediated responses and leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis pathway. Estrogens may promote neutrophilic inflammation in subjects with asthma and COPD. Moreover, the activation of estrogen receptors might induce tumorigenesis. In this chapter, we summarize the most recent advances in the functional roles and associated signaling pathways of inflammatory cellular responses in asthma, COPD, PF, LC, and newly occurring COVID-19 disease. We also meticulously deliberate the influence of sex steroids on the development and progress of these common and severe lung diseases.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68748-9_15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019274/";01/01/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9876
311;Neuropathological explanation of minimal COVID-19 infection rate in newborns, infants and children – a mystery so far. New insight into the role of Substance P;10.1016/j.jns.2020.117276;Sars-Cov-2 or Novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has become a global challenge, affecting elderly population at large, causing a burden on hospitals. It has been affecting the world from a health and economic perspective after its emergence since October 2019 at Wuhan province of China. Later on it became a pandemic, with aged people most affected. Surprisingly, the infants and children were not severely infected and mortality among them was reported infrequently. If they died it was due to some comorbidity or congenital heart problems. Why the rate of infection varies in different age groups around the world and what is the protective mechanism in children remains a mystery. Based on our neuropathological experience at the “Lino Rossi Research Center for the study and prevention of the unexpected perinatal death and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)” of the University of Milan, Italy, we hypothesize that the decreased severity of the disease in infants compared to the elderly may be due to alteration at neurotransmitter levels especially of the Substance P (SP) and of the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the brainstem that is responsible for its secretion. This neurotransmitter may be directly related to the respiratory illness as is in COVID-19 infection. It is responsible for the increased inflammation and the characteristic symptoms associated with this disease. It is the main switch that must be urgently turned off using the NK-1R antagonist which is the receptor of SP and responsible for its functionality, especially in the elderly.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20306122; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20306122; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33360484/";15/01/2021;Novel coronavirus infection;0.9132
312;ACVIM consensus statement on pancreatitis in cats;10.1111/jvim.16053;BACKGROUND: Pancreatitis in cats, although commonly diagnosed, still presents many diagnostic and management challenges. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current literature as it relates to etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of pancreatitis in cats and to arrive at clinically relevant suggestions for veterinary clinicians that are based on evidence, and where such evidence is lacking, based on consensus of experts in the field. ANIMALS: None. METHODS: A panel of 8 experts in the field (5 internists, 1 radiologist, 1 clinical pathologist, and 1 anatomic pathologist), with support from a librarian, was formed to assess and summarize evidence in the peer reviewed literature and complement it with consensus clinical recommendations. RESULTS: There was little literature on the etiology and pathogenesis of spontaneous pancreatitis in cats, but there was much in the literature about the disease in humans, along with some experimental evidence in cats and nonfeline species. Most evidence was in the area of diagnosis of pancreatitis in cats, which was summarized carefully. In contrast, there was little evidence on the management of pancreatitis in cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Pancreatitis is amenable to antemortem diagnosis by integrating all clinical and diagnostic information available, and recognizing that acute pancreatitis is far easier to diagnose than chronic pancreatitis. Although both forms of pancreatitis can be managed successfully in many cats, management measures are far less clearly defined for chronic pancreatitis.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33587762/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.16053";15/02/2021;Pancreatitis in cats;0.9135
313;The necessary cooperation between governments and public in the fight against COVID-19: why non-pharmaceutical interventions may be ineffective;10.1101/2020.08.17.20176347;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is the biggest public health challenge in the last 100 years. No successful pharmaceutical treatment is yet available, thus effective public health interventions to contain COVID-19 include social distancing, isolation and quarantine measures. However the efficiency of these containment measures varied among countries and even within states in the same country. Despite Brazil being deeply affected by coronavirus, the federal government never proposed a coordinated action to control COVID-19 and Brazilian states, which are autonomous, each imposed different containment measures. The state of Goias declared strict social distancing measures in March 13, but gradually relaxed many of its first measures due specially to public pressure. Here we use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model combined with Bayesian inference and a time-dependent spreading rate to assess how past state-level interventions affected the spread of COVID-19 in Goias. The interventions succeeded in decreasing the transmission rate in the state, however, after the third intervention the rate remained positive and exponential. Thus, other stricter interventions were made necessary to avoid the growth of new cases and a collapse in the health system. Governmental interventions need to be taken seriously by the population in order for them have the proposed outcome. Our results reflect the population's disregard with the measures imposed and the need for cooperation between governments and its citizens in the fight against COVID-19.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.17.20176347v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.17.20176347";19/08/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9169
314;Quality of life and psycho-emotional wellbeing in bladder cancer patients and their caregivers: a comparative analysis between urostomy versus ileal orthotopic neobladder;10.3332/ecancer.2021.1163;"BACKGROUND: The impact of neobladder and urostomy on bladder cancer patient’s health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) is controversial and many issues currently remain under-investigated. Initial studies pointed out that the emotional responses of caregivers might be ‘contagious’, influencing emotional reactions in bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy. METHODS: Three hundred and eighty-two bladder cancer patients (aged M = 67.29 years; SD = 9.23) (16.9% (65) were female and 82.9% (319) were male) and their caregivers were enrolled. Data were collected prospectively: at T0 (1 month before the surgery), at T1 (2 weeks after the surgery, at patient discharge from the hospital) and at T2 (6-month follow-up). At each time point (T0, T1 and T2), a set of questionnaires (EORT QLQ-C30 and emotion thermometer) were given to patients and their caregivers. RESULTS: All patients reported a general improvement in the HR-QoL and global health status/QoL from T0 to T2 (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between neobladder and urostomy. At T0, the emotional thermometer total scoring in caregivers was positive in relation to HR-QoL (p < 0.001) and negative in relation to the patient’s perception of QoL (p < 0.001) and global health (p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed at T1 and T2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that patients and their caregiver’s emotional reactions to cancer are deep-rooted and strongly interconnected, and they provide innovative insights for the clinical management of bladder cancer patients.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33680077/; https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2021.1163";05/01/2021;CONCLUSIONS;0.9322
315;COMDORA-SBN recommendations for patients with rare kidney diseases in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic;10.1590/2175-8239-jbn-2020-s109;"During the Covid-19 pandemic, the issue is how to maintain adequate care for people with other diseases. In this document, the SBN Rare Diseases Committee (COMDORA) gives some guidelines on the care of patients with rare kidney diseases. These patients should follow the recommendations for the general population, bearing in mind that, as they have chronic kidney disease, they are included in the risk group for more serious outcomes if they develop Covid-19. Non-essential decision-making procedures should be postponed. In stable cases under appropriate treatment, we must choose to contact our patients remotely, using teleconsultations and home exam collections (if possible). In the presence of a symptom or sign of decompensation of the underlying disease, or infection with Sars-cov-2, advise the patient to seek medical assistance. The patient should not be waiting to get worse. Changes to the prescription should only be made on a scientific basis. Dosage suspension or change is not recommended, even in cases in which the patient needs to go to a center to receive his medication; in this case, the infusion center must follow the recommendations of the Ministry of Health. If the patient develops Covid-19 and uses any drugs, check the need for dose adjustment of the routine medications. Avoid the use of antimetabolics and anti-CD20 in patients with Covid-19, as they reduce viral clearance and predispose to bacterial infections. Contact between the patient and the medical team is essential; changes are recommended only with specialized medical guidance.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32877497/; https://doi.org/10.1590/2175-8239-jbn-2020-s109";26/08/2020;SBN Rare Diseases Committee;0.9115
316;Radiotherapeutic management of brain tumours during the COVID-19 pandemic;10.1017/s1460396920000394;AIM: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is bound to put tremendous pressure on the existing healthcare system. This aim of this technical note is to help in triaging patients with brain tumours who are sent for radiotherapy during this pandemic and to provide safe and evidence-based care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published data for this review were identified by systematically searching PubMed database from November 2007 onwards with the following Medical Subject Heading (Mesh) terms ‘Brain tumours’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘SARS-nCoV-2’, ‘Radiotherapy’, ‘Guidelines’ ‘hypofractionation’ using Boolean search algorithm. Articles in English language were reviewed. RESULTS: We tried to apply the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle in triaging and management of patients for radiotherapy. We identified protocols which have hypofractionated regimens (reducing patient visits to hospital, time spent in treatment console) with similar outcomes when compared to conventional fractionated regimens and not overburdening the healthcare facility. We also identified the tumours for which we could safely avoid or delay the initiation of radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Treatment decisions made during the COVID-19 pandemic rely on the safety first/do no harm principle and evidence-based prioritisation of cases for triage. This article is a tool to aid in triaging and prioritising brain tumour patient management. This is for consideration during the pandemic only and certainly not as a strategy for permanent practice change.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7283107/;09/06/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9173
317;Effect of public health interventions during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Cyprus: a modelling study;10.1101/2021.01.02.20248980;BackgroundCyprus addressed the first wave of SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) by implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions. The aims of this study were: a) to estimate epidemiological parameters of this wave including infection attack ratio, infection fatality ratio, and case ascertainment ratio, b) to assess the impact of public health interventions, and c) to examine what would have happened if those interventions had not been implemented. MethodsA dynamic, stochastic, individual-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model was developed to simulate COVID-19 transmission and progression in the population of the Republic of Cyprus. The model was fitted to the observed trends in COVID-19 deaths and intensive care unit (ICU) bed use. ResultsBy May 8 2020th, the infection attack ratio was 0.31% (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 0.15%, 0.54%), the infection fatality ratio was 0.71% (95% CrI: 0.44%, 1.61%), and the case ascertainment ratio was 33.2% (95% CrI: 19.7%, 68.7%). If Cyprus had not implemented any public health measure, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed by April 14th. The interventions averted 715 (95% CrI: 339, 1235) deaths. If Cyprus had only increased ICU beds, without any social distancing measure, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed by April 19th. ConclusionsThe decision of the Cypriot authorities to launch early non-pharmaceutical interventions limited the burden of the first wave of COVID-19. The findings of these analyses could help address the next waves of COVID-19 in Cyprus and other similar settings.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.02.20248980; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.20248980v1?rss=1";01/01/2021;SARS CoV-2;0.9733
318;Increased serum thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin but lower complement C3 and C4 levels in COVID-19: associations with chest CT-scan anomalies and lowered peripheral oxygen saturation.;10.1101/2021.04.10.21255240;Background. COVID-19 patients suffer from hypercoagulation and activated immune-inflammatory pathways. This study was performed to assay serum complement C3 and C4, and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) in association with chest CT scan anomalies (CCTAs) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) Methods. Serum levels of C3, C4, TxA2, and PGI2 were measured by ELISA and albumin, calcium, and magnesium by spectrophotometric method in 60 COVID-19 patients and 30 controls. Results. C3 and C4 are significantly decreased and TxA2 and PGI2 significantly increased in COVID-19 patients as compared with controls. Neural networks showed that a combination of C3, albumin, and TxA2 yielded a predictive accuracy of 100% in detecting COVID-19 patients. SpO2 was significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients and was inversely associated with TxA2 and PGI2, and positively with C3, C4, albumin, and calcium. CCTAs were accompanied by lower SpO2 and albumin, and increased PGI2 levels. Patients with positive IgG results show significantly higher SpO2, TxA2, PGI2, and C4 levels than IgG negative patients. Conclusion. Hypoalbuminemia, which is strongly associated with lung lesions and lowered peripheral oxygen saturation, is characterized by increased TxA2, suggesting that interactions between immune-inflammatory pathways and platelet hyperactivity participate in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and consequently may play a role in enhanced risk of hypercoagulability and venous thromboembolism. These mechanisms are aggravated by lowered calcium and magnesium levels.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.10.21255240v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.10.21255240";13/04/2021;pathophysiology;0.9286
319;ACE gene variants rise the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or diabetes. A pilot study;10.1101/2021.03.24.21253576;Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continues to scale and threaten human health and public safety. It is essential to identify those risk factors that lead to a poor prognosis of the disease. A predisposing host genetic background could be one of these factors that explain the interindividual variability to COVID-19 severity. Thus, we have studied whether the rs4341 and rs4343 polymorphisms of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene, key regulator of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS), could explain the different outcomes of 128 COVID-19 patients with diverse degree of severity (33 asymptomatic or mildly asymptomatic, 66 hospitalized in the general ward, and 29 admitted to the ICU). We found that G allele of rs4341 and rs4343 was associated with severe COVID-19 in hypertensive patients, independently of gender (p<0.05). G-carrier genotypes of both polymorphisms were also associated with higher mortality (p< 0.05) and higher severity of COVID-19 in dyslipidemic (p<0.05) and type 2 diabetic patients (p< 0.01). In conclusion, our preliminary study suggests that the G-containing genotypes of rs4341 and rs4343 confer an additional risk of adverse COVID-19 prognosis. Thus, rs4341 and rs4343 polymorphisms of ACE could be predictive markers of severity of COVID-19 in those patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or diabetes. The knowledge of these genetic data could contribute to precision management of SARS-Cov2 infected patients when admitted to hospital.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.21253576v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.21253576";26/03/2021;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9699

In understanding the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and mechanism of action, it is essential to depict the full repertoire of expressed viral proteins. The recent biological studies have highlighted the leader protein Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 importance in shutting down the host protein production. Besides, it still enigmatic how Nsp1 regulates for translation. Here we report the novel structure of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 in complex with the SL1 region of 5′UTR of SARS-CoV-2, and its factual interaction is corroborated with enzyme kinetics and experimental binding affinity studies. The studies also address how leader protein Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 recognizes its self RNA toward translational regulation by further recruitment of the 40S ribosome. With the aid of molecular dynamics and simulations, we also demonstrated the real-time stability and functional dynamics of the Nsp1/SL1 complex. The studies also report the potential inhibitors and their mode of action to block viral protein/RNA complex formation. This enhance our understanding of the mechanism of the first viral protein Nsp1 synthesized in the human cell to regulate the translation of self and host. Understanding the structure and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 and its interplay with the viral RNA and ribosome will open the arena for exploring the development of live attenuated vaccines and effective therapeutic targets for this disease.;"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33135884/";02/11/2020;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9488

Viscoelastic testing may identify and characterise hypercoagulable states which are not apparent using conventional coagulation assays OBJECTIVES: To undertake viscoelastic evaluation of the coagulation state in critically ill adults with COVID-19 associated respiratory failure METHODS: Single centre observational point prevalence cohort study of adults requiring respiratory support in the intensive care unit with COVID-19 associated respiratory failure. Coagulation status was evaluated using rotational thromboelastometry in conjunction with laboratory markers of coagulation. RESULTS: Six patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Each patient had one ROTEM performed. All patients had supra-normal clot amplitude at 10 minutes (A10) and supra-normal clot firmness (MCF) measured in at least one ROTEM pathway, and 5 were supra-normal on all pathways. Minimal clot lysis was present on all analyses. Fibrinogen and d-dimer were elevated and routine markers of coagulation within normal ranges in all patients. CONCLUSION: Patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 associated respiratory failure exhibit a hyper-coagulable state which is not appreciable on conventional tests of coagulation. Supra-normal clot firmness, minimal fibrinolysis and hyperfibrinogenaemia are key findings. Further research is required into the pathophysiology of this hypercoagulable state, as well as the harms and benefits of different anticoagulation strategies.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S103673142030254X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773357/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S103673142030254X?v=s5";21/07/2020;Coronavirus-19;0.9702
322;Inhaled high molecular weight hyaluronan ameliorates respiratory failure in acute COPD exacerbation: a pilot study;10.1186/s12931-020-01610-x;BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) carry significant morbidity and mortality. AECOPD treatment remains limited. High molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA) is a glycosaminoglycan sugar, which is a physiological constituent of the lung extracellular matrix and has notable anti-inflammatory and hydrating properties. RESEARCH QUESTION: We hypothesized that inhaled HMW-HA will improve outcomes in AECOPD. METHODS: We conducted a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to investigate the effect of inhaled HMW-HA in patients with severe AECOPD necessitating non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Primary endpoint was time until liberation from NIPPV. RESULTS: Out of 44 screened patients, 41 were included in the study (21 for placebo and 20 for HMW-HA). Patients treated with HMW-HA had significantly shorter duration of NIPPV. HMW-HA treated patients also had lower measured peak airway pressures on the ventilator and lower systemic inflammation markers after liberation from NIPPV. In vitro testing showed that HMW-HA significantly improved mucociliary transport in air–liquid interface cultures of primary bronchial cells from COPD patients and healthy primary cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract. INTERPRETATION: Inhaled HMW-HA shortens the duration of respiratory failure and need for non-invasive ventilation in patients with AECOPD. Beneficial effects of HMW-HA on mucociliary clearance and inflammation may account for some of the effects (NCT02674880, www.clinicaltrials.gov).;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847749/;01/02/2021;Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9039
323;Treatment of opioid use disorder in primary care.;10.1136/bmj.n784;Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a common, treatable chronic disease that can be effectively managed in primary care settings. Untreated OUD is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality-notably, overdose, infectious complications of injecting drug use, and profoundly diminished quality of life. Withdrawal management and medication tapers are ineffective and are associated with increased rates of relapse and death. Pharmacotherapy is the evidence based mainstay of OUD treatment, and many studies support its integration into primary care settings. Evidence is strongest for the opioid agonists buprenorphine and methadone, which randomized controlled trials have shown to decrease illicit opioid use and mortality. Discontinuation of opioid agonist therapy is associated with increased rates of relapse and mortality. Less evidence is available for the opioid antagonist extended release naltrexone, with a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showing decreased illicit opioid use but no effect on mortality. Treating OUD in primary care settings is cost effective, improves outcomes for both OUD and other medical comorbidities, and is highly acceptable to patients. Evidence on whether behavioral interventions improve outcomes for patients receiving pharmacotherapy is mixed, with guidelines promoting voluntary engagement in psychosocial supports, including counseling. Further work is needed to promote the integration of OUD treatment into primary care and to overcome regulatory barriers to integrating methadone into primary care treatment in the US.;"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011512/";19/05/2021;Opioid use disorder;0.9463
324;Evaluation of algal chlorophyll and nutrient relations and the N:P ratios along with trophic status and light regime in 60 Korea reservoirs.;10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140451;The present study aimed to determine the spatial and temporal variations in trophic state and identify potential causes for these variations in 60 Korean reservoirs. Empirical models were developed using the relations of nutrients (total phosphorus, TP, and total nitrogen, TN) with chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) for efficient lake managements. The empirical models indicated that TP was the key regulating factor for algal growth in agricultural (R2 = 0.69) and power generation (R2 = 0.50) reservoirs. The CHL-a:TP and TN:TP ratios, indicators of phosphorus limitation, were used to validate the phosphorus reduction approach. The mean CHL-a:TP ratio of agricultural reservoirs was 0.60, indicating that algal chlorophyll is potentially limited by TP than any other factors. Agricultural, multipurpose, and power generation reservoirs, based on the N:P ratios, were more P- limited systems than natural lakes and estuarine reservoirs. The trophic state index (TSI) of Korean reservoirs varied between mesotrophy to hypereutrophy based on values of TSI (TP), TSI (CHL-a), and TSI (SD). Agricultural reservoirs were hypereutrophic using the criteria of TSI (CHL-a) and blue-green algae dominated the algal community. Analysis of trophic state index deviation (TSID) indicated that agricultural reservoirs were primarily P limited and other factors had minor effect. In contrast, the trophic status of estuarine and power generation reservoirs and natural lakes was largely modified by non-algal turbidity.

325;São Paulo’s atmospheric pollution reduction and its social isolation effect, Brazil;10.1007/s11869-020-00959-8;"Since January 2020, studies report reductions in air pollution among several countries due to social isolation measures, which have been adopted in order to contain the coronavirus outbreak progress (COVID-19). This study aims to evaluate the change in the atmospheric pollution levels by NO and NO(2) in São Paulo City for the social isolation period. The NO and NO(2) hourly concentrations were obtained through air quality monitoring stations from CETESB, from January 14, 2020 to April 12, 2020. Mann-Kendall and the Pettitt tests were performed in the air pollutant time series. We observed an overall negative trend in all stations, indicating a decreasing temporal pattern in concentrations. Regarding NO, the highest absolute decrease rates were observed in the Congonhas (− 6.39 μg m(−3) month(−1)) and Marginal Tietê (− 6.19 μg m(−3) month(−1)) stations; regarding NO(2), the highest rates were observed in the Marginal Tietê (− 4.45 μg m(−3) month(−1)) and Cerqueira César (− 4.34 μg m(−3) month(−1)) stations. In addition, we identified a turning point in the NO and NO(2) series trends that occurred close to the start date of the social isolation period (March 20, 2020). Moreover, from statistical analysis, it was found that NO(2) is a suitable surrogate for monitoring economic activities during social isolation periods. Thus, we concluded that social isolation measures implemented on March 20, 2020 caused significant changes in the air pollutant concentrations in the city of São Paulo (as high as − 200% in NO(2) levels).";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110453/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11869-020-00959-8";23/10/2020;coronavirus outbreak progress;0.9529
326;Cardiac surgery during the COVID‐19 sine wave: Preparation once, preparation twice. The view from Houston;10.1111/jocs.14987;The novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic has created major challenges and disruptions to hospitals throughout the world, with profound implications for cardiac surgery and cardiac surgeons. In this review, we highlight the hospital and cardiac surgical experience at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas as of mid‐July 2020. Our local experience has consisted of a spring surge (early March to early May), followed by a relative flattening and then a summer surge (early June to present day), similar to a sine wave. Throughout the entire pandemic, our simultaneous medical priorities have been treating the growing number of patients with COVID‐19 while continuing to provide needed care for those without COVID‐19. The current situation will be the “new normal” until a vaccine becomes available. It will be vital to stay attuned to epidemiologists, public health officials, and infection control experts, because what they see today, the intensive care units will see tomorrow. The lessons we have learned are outlined in this review but can be summarized most succinctly: preparation. We must prepare in advance, stockpile supplies and personal protective equipment, have rapid and vigorous testing protocols in place, utilize technology (eg, online meetings, videoconference “office visits”), and encourage hospital‐wide and community protective efforts (social distancing, mask wearing, hand hygiene). Hopefully, the lessons learned through this challenging experience will prepare us for the next time.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985747/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14987";28/09/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9668
327;Advancements in research and development to combat COVID-19 using nanotechnology;10.1007/s41204-021-00102-7;The whole world is currently facing a global health crisis due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus 2, which started in Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. The pandemic has affected 235 countries, areas or territories and infected over 42 million people across the globe as per WHO update on 27 October 2020. More than 1.1 million people have died and the numbers are increasing daily. However, some drugs have been authorized for emergency treatment of patients, medication and vaccines with proven efficacy to prevent and treat the disease is still under various phases of development. The entire world is consistently making efforts to address three major challenges related to COVID-19 including prevention of its spread, prompt and early diagnosis and treatment of patients to save lives. Touted as one of the game-changing technologies of the century, nanotechnology has huge potential to develop solutions against these three major challenges of the disease. Nanotechnology comprises of multidisciplinary prospects encompassing diverse disciplines including medicine, material science, artificial intelligence, environment, virology, physical sciences, chemistry and biology. The numerous challenges can be addressed through the engineering of the various physicochemical properties of materials presents in abundance in nature. Various claims, studies and reports on research and development to combat these challenges associated with COVID-19 have been collectively discussed in this article from the perspectives of nanotechnology.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7829094/;25/01/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9829
328;Telemedicine in the emergency department to decrease personal protective equipment use: a before-and-after study.;10.1136/emermed-2020-210292;"BACKGROUND Personal protective equipment (PPE) used by healthcare workers was scarce during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess whether telemedicine (using iPads) reduced PPE use in emergency department (ED) patients who were treated in contact isolation, and whether telemedicine had a positive effect on patient anxiety and satisfaction. METHODS We conducted a prospective single centre before-and-after study including ED patients ≥18 years who were treated in contact isolation. PPE use, the Hospital Anxiety Scale and the 15-item Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire were compared between the control period (8 April to 14 April 2020) and intervention period (15 April to 24 April 2020). RESULTS We included 25 patients in each period. PPE use per patient was higher for physicians in the control period (mean 1.7; 95% CI 1.5 to 1.9) compared with the intervention period (mean 1.2; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3, p<0.01). Total PPE use per patient contact for ED physicians decreased from 42 out of 42 patient contacts in the control period, to 29 out of 66 patient contacts in the intervention period (difference 54.3%; 95% CI 50.1% to 58.6%, p<0.01). Reported anxiety and satisfaction were not significantly different. CONCLUSION PPE use by physicians can successfully be reduced by using telemedicine in the ED without increasing anxiety or dissatisfaction. This study was a first step to gain experience with telemedicine in the ED which has the potential to reduce PPE use in future pandemics or other patients with an indication for contact isolation.";"https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-210292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355305/";21/12/2020;Personal protective equipment;0.9409
329;COVID-19 Vaccines are Effective in People with Obesity: A Position Statement from The Obesity Society.;10.1002/oby.23251;"The position statement is issued by The Obesity Society in response to published literature, as well as inquiries made to the Society by patients, providers, society members, policy makers, and others regarding the efficacy of vaccines in persons with obesity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19). The Obesity Society has critically evaluated data from published peer-reviewed literature and briefing documents from Emergency Use Authorization applications submitted by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. We conclude that these vaccines are highly efficacious, and their efficacy is not significantly different in people with and without obesity, based on scientific evidence available at the time of publication. The Obesity Society believes there is no definitive way to determine which of these three COVID-19 vaccines is ""best"" for any weight subpopulation (due to differences in the trial design and outcome measures in the phase 3 trials, elapsed time between doses, and regional differences in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants [e.g. South Africa B.1.351 in Johnson and Johnson trial]). All three trials have demonstrated high efficacy against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death. Therefore, The Obesity Society encourages adults with obesity ≥18 years (≥16 years for Pfizer-BioNTech) to undergo vaccination with any one of the currently available vaccines authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as soon as they are able.";"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34212511/";01/07/2021;Coronavirus Disease-19;0.9927
330;Ventilation and detection of airborne SARS-CoV-2: elucidating high-risk spaces in naturally ventilated healthcare settings;10.1101/2021.06.30.21258984;Background: In healthcare settings in low- and middle-income countries, which frequently rely upon natural ventilation, the risk of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in naturally-ventilated hospital settings by measuring parameters of ventilation and comparing these findings with results of bioaerosol sampling. Methods: We measured outdoor and room CO2 to estimate absolute ventilation (liters per second [L/s]) from 9 hospitals in Bangladesh during October 2020 - February 2021. We estimated infectious risk across different spaces using a modified Wells-Riley equation. We collected air samples from these same spaces at 12.5 L/min over 30 minutes and performed RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 N-gene. We used multivariable linear regression and calculated elasticity to identify characteristics associated with ventilation. Results: Based on ventilation of 86 patient care areas and COVID-19 case numbers, we found that over a 40-hour exposure period, outpatient departments posed the highest median risk for infection (5.4%), followed by COVID intensive care units (1.8%). We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 18.6% (16/86) of air samples. Ceiling height and total open area of doors and windows were found to have the greatest impact on ventilation. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that naturally-ventilated healthcare settings may pose a high risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, particularly among non-COVID designated spaces, but improving parameters of ventilation can mitigate this risk.;http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.21258984v1?rss=1;02/07/2021;intensive care units;0.9721
331;COVID-19 and ST elevations–keep an open mind: a case report;10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa269;"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a range of cardiovascular manifestations, including myocardial injury and thrombo-embolism. Pulmonary embolism (PE) causing anteroseptal/anterior ST elevations that mimic myocardial infarction have previously been described. This phenomenon is thought to be related to right ventricular injury from large emboli. CASE SUMMARY: A 48-year-old woman with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented to her local hospital with fever, cough, nausea, and dyspnoea. A test for SARS-CoV-2 was taken, and she was discharged with instructions to self-quarantine. She was subsequently notified of a positive SARS-CoV-2 result. Three days later, she re-presented with worsening dyspnoea and respiratory failure requiring intubation. On hospital Day 6, she became acutely hypoxic and hypotensive. Telemetry was noted to have ST changes, prompting ECG that revealed sinus tachycardia with prominent new ST elevations in her precordial leads. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function; however, the right ventricle was moderately dilated with positive McConnell’s sign. Due to her unstable clinical state and high suspicion for PE, she was treated with tenecteplase 50 mg i.v. with complete resolution of her ST elevations and improved oxygenation. DISCUSSION: Given the high rates of thrombo-embolic events in COVID-19 patients, PE should be in the differential diagnosis of ST elevation, particularly in younger patients with few risk factors for coronary artery disease.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437915/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa269";18/10/2020;Coronavirus disease 2019;0.902
332;Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as a biomarker for predicting acute kidney injury after coronary artery bypass grafting;10.1186/s42077-020-00123-5;BACKGROUND: Early and precocious determination of acute kidney injury (AKI) is essential to prevent morbidity and mortality following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Evaluation of the perioperative renal function is substantial using novel biomarkers other than the late traditional method of using serum creatinine. Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a biomarker investigated for early detection of AKI in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, and its role has to be determined in this study. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients undergoing elective CABG were enrolled in this cohort study and were assigned into two groups: group I include the patients that did not develop AKI (no AKI group) and group II include the patients that developed AKI (AKI group). Acute kidney injury based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification had been developed in 7 patients (28%). Plasma NGAL levels at 6 h were higher in patients who developed AKI compared with those who did not (302 ± 88.02 vs. 116.50 ± 17.33 ng/m, p value < 0.001). The cut-off value of plasma NGAL levels measured 6 h postoperatively was 145 ng/ml and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.965. Results of this study showed that plasma NGAL is a robust early biomarker of AKI, which preceded the rise in serum creatinine by many hours. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that earlier diagnosis of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing CABG can be achieved by measuring postoperative plasma NGAL concentration at 6 h.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7816152/;20/01/2021;Early and precocious determination of acute kidney injury;0.9158
333;Digital Consumption Pattern and Impacts of Social Media: Descriptive Statistical Analysis;10.1007/978-981-33-6815-6_3;Dependence on digital media has increased manifold during the COVID—pandemic lockdowns, across the globe. Most of the offices and academic institutions started operating, on ‘work-from-home’ mode, on digital platform. Even senior citizens, non-working homemakers and kids spent more time in social (networking and communication) media. The ‘difficult times’ of COVID—pandemic has also shown the world the ‘different times’ and the difference in our preferred way of functioning. The ‘digital consumption pattern’ changed substantially, both by its scale and by diversity. The present paper discusses the issue of ‘effectiveness and impact’ of ‘digital medium’ on ‘digital life’ of its users (/digital consumers), particularly during this extended lockdown. The objective is to discuss issues relating to the ‘effect of extended/longer use of net, during this pandemic, for academic and professional activities from home, continuously’. The study is about the life in virtual world, particularly during this extended lockdown. The paper adopts a method of descriptive statistical analysis, covering different categories of users of Eastern India. Using a structured questionnaire method, descriptive primary data, relating to digital consumption, were collected from around 1350 respondents, from Odisha and its neighbouring states. Result shows how different categories prefer and use their preferred social media.

334;Development, Practice Patterns, and Early Clinical Outcomes of a Multidisciplinary Liver Cancer Clinic;10.1177/10732748211009945;Multidisciplinary care has been associated with improved survival in patients with primary liver cancers. We report the practice patterns and real world clinical outcomes for patients presenting to the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) multidisciplinary liver clinic (MDLC). We analyzed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 100) and biliary tract cancer (BTC, n = 76) patients evaluated at the JHH MDLC in 2019. We describe the conduct of the clinic, consensus decisions for patient management based on stage categories, and describe treatment approaches and outcomes based on these categories. We describe subclassification of BCLC stage C into 2 parts, and subclassification of cholangiocarcinoma into 4 stages. A treatment consensus was finalized on the day of MDLC for the majority of patients (89% in HCC, 87% in BTC), with high adherence to MDLC recommendations (91% in HCC, 100% in BTC). Among patients presenting for a second opinion regarding management, 28% of HCC and 31% of BTC patients were given new therapeutic recommendations. For HCC patients, at a median follow up of 11.7 months (0.7-19.4 months), median OS was not reached in BCLC A and B patients. In BTC patients, at a median follow up of 14.2 months (0.9-21.1 months) the median OS was not reached in patients with resectable or borderline resectable disease, and was 11.9 months in patients with unresectable or metastatic disease. Coordinated expert multidisciplinary care is feasible for primary liver cancers with high adherence to recommendations and a change in treatment for a sizeable minority of patients.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/10732748211009945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882707/";22/04/2021;hepatocellular carcinoma;0.9403
335;Characterisation of protease activity during SARS-CoV-2 infection identifies novel viral cleavage sites and cellular targets with therapeutic potential;10.1101/2020.09.16.297945;SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent behind the COVID-19 pandemic, and responsible for over 170 million infections, and over 3.7 million deaths worldwide. Efforts to test, treat and vaccinate against this pathogen all benefit from an improved understanding of the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2. Both viral and cellular proteases play a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and inhibitors targeting proteases have already shown success at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models. Here, we study proteolytic cleavage of viral and cellular proteins in two cell line models of SARS-CoV-2 replication using mass spectrometry to identify protein neo-N-termini generated through protease activity. We identify previously unknown cleavage sites in multiple viral proteins, including major antigenic proteins S and N, which are the main targets for vaccine and antibody testing efforts. We discovered significant increases in cellular cleavage events consistent with cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and identify 14 potential high-confidence substrates of the main and papain-like proteases, validating a subset with in vitro assays. We showed that siRNA depletion of these cellular proteins inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, and that drugs targeting two of these proteins: the tyrosine kinase SRC and Ser/Thr kinase MYLK, showed a dose-dependent reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titres. Overall, our study provides a powerful resource to understand proteolysis in the context of viral infection, and to inform the development of targeted strategies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and treat COVID-19.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.16.297945;14/06/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.9309
336;What does social distancing mean for patients in forensic mental health settings?;10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100018;"Governments across the globe have called for social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secure settings will not be able to comply with these strictly, nor will they have the same recourse to the novel and creative solutions the general population does. Activities have been restricted in quality, quantity and scope; transfers and discharges have been halted and patient progress put on pause. Understanding how and what ways these restrictions will affect patients is crucial. This is especially salient given that large numbers of the general population have reported heightened mental health burden in recent surveys. However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group. This paper suggests how we can use past research exploring patient expereinces of restrictive interventions to guide the implementation of social distancing measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.";"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666353820300114; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666353820300114?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171036/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100018";28/04/2020;social distancing measures;0.9619
337;Cardiac Involvment in COVID-19–Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome;10.1016/j.amjcard.2020.07.010;The cardiac involvement in (COVID-19) Coronavirus disease is still under evaluation, especially in severe COVID-19-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The cardiac involvement was assessed by serial troponin levels and echocardiograms in 28 consecutive patients with COVID-19 ARDS consecutively admitted to our Intensive Care Unit from 1(st) March to 31(th) March. Twenty-eight COVID-19 patients (aged 61.7 ± 10 years, males 79%). The majority was mechanically ventilated (86%) and four patients (14%) required veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). As of 31(th) March, the ICU mortality rate was 7%, while 7 patients was discharged (25%) with a length of stay of 8.2 ±5 days. At echocardiographic assessment on admission, acute core pulmonale was detected in two patients who required ECMO support. Increased systolic arterial pressure was detected in all patients. Increased Troponin T levels were detectable in 11 patients (39%) on admission. At linear regression analysis, troponin T showed a direct relationship with CRP (R square: 0.082, F: 5.95, p=0.017). In conclusions, in COVID-19-related ARDS, increased in Tn levels was common but not associated with alterations in wall motion kinesis, thus suggesting that troponin T elevation is likely to be multifactorial, mainly linked to disease severely (as inferred by the relation between Tn and CRP). The increase in systolic pulmonary arterial pressures observed in all patients may be related to hypoxic vasoconstriction.

338;Intimate partner violence in Greece: a study of 664 consecutive forensic clinical examinations.;10.1093/fampra/cmaa052;BACKGROUND Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a well-known phenomenon, which affects mostly women. While IPV victims may attend emergency departments (EDs) seeking medical care, not all of them will make an allegation against their abusers. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and the characteristics of the victims, who had made an allegation about the violent incident and had been examined by a forensic pathologist for judicial purposes, and had attended EDs seeking medical care, before the forensic examination. METHODS We reviewed the archives of clinical examinations that were conducted at the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens during a 5-year period (2012-16). RESULTS Six hundred sixty-four clinical examinations were conducted at our Department for IPV allegations. According to our findings, women were more likely to seek medical care than men. Victims who have attended EDs were more likely to have sustained injuries located at least on the head or on the lower limbs. CONCLUSION The majority of IPV victims in the broader region of Attica (Greece) were women, usually married, and aged between 30 and 49 years old. Despite the fact that the majority of IPV incidents are not reported to police, every person who is engaged in the process of dealing with IPV victims has to be educated and adequately informed about this phenomenon, its implications and the possible ways to deal with it. Furthermore, victims need to be educated and informed adequately in waiting rooms of EDs.;"https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmaa052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417883/";17/05/2020;Intimate partner violence;0.9279
339;What GDPR and the Health Research Regulations (HRRs) mean for Ireland: “explicit consent”—a legal analysis;10.1007/s11845-020-02331-2;BACKGROUND: Irish Health Research Regulations (HRRs) were introduced following the commencement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018. The HRRs set out supplementary regulatory requirements for research. A legal analysis presented under the auspices of the Irish Academy of Medical Sciences (IAMS) on April 8 and November 25, 2019 at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland welcomed the introduction of GDPR and the HRRs. The analysis found the GDPR “explicit consent” introduced by the HRRs is problematic. A call was made to regulate informed consent in line with the common law as an achievable alternative safeguard, bringing Ireland in line with other EU Member States. AIMS: This article aims to review academic papers, legal opinion, EU opinion and advice and data protection law in relation to research and explicit consent, in order to examine the legal burden of GDPR and the HRRs on health research in Ireland and to determine whether the analysis presented at the IAMS meetings is reflected more widely in legal text. METHODS: Legal literature review of academic papers, legal opinion, EU opinion and advice and data protection legislation. RESULTS: The legal literature review overwhelmingly supports the concerns raised. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the GDPR explicit consent requirement of the HRRs is having had a significantly negative and far-reaching impact on the conduct of health research in Ireland.

The aim of the study was to assess adherence of Sudanese doctors to the SPIKES protocol in breaking bad news. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study recruited 192 doctors, at Wad Medani teaching hospital, Sudan. A questionnaire-based on SPIKES protocol was distributed among 10 departments in our hospital. Data were analyzed using SPSS and Microsoft excel. RESULTS: There were (n = 101, 52.6%) females and (n = 91, 47.4%) males among the participants. 95.3% have been involved in breaking bad news, but only 56.3 received education and training about this issue. 43% admitted bad experience in breaking bad news, while 65.6% mentioned that bad news should be delivered directly to patients. The majority (>90%) agreed training is needed in the area of breaking bad news. Usual adherence to the SPIKES protocol was reported in a range of 35–79%, sometimes adherence was reported in a range of 20–44% while never adherence was reported in a range of zero–13.5%. Consultants, registrars, obstetrician and gynecologists and surgeons achieved high scores in breaking bad news. Training is an important factor in achieving high score in SPIKES protocol. The unadjusted effect of background factors on SPIKES score, showed that only training has significant impact on protocol adherence (P = 0.034, unadjusted; and P = 0.038 adjusted).

Public transport is mostly used in the city to serve many people at a time. It was a risky area for contracting the infection. The mental health of a community is vital to promote their immunity and day-to-day activities of humans. This study aimed to determine general anxiety disorder among public transport users in relation to new coronavirus pandemic during the initial phase at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The cross-sectional study design was conducted from March 15 to 25, 2020, using a stratified sampling technique. The structured interview was used to collect information on demographic data and general anxiety disorder for the past 2 weeks related to COVID-19. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 was used to assess the outcome variable, and logistic regression analysis at a 95% confidence interval, p < 0.05, was used to predict variables associated with the outcome variable. This study enrolled 420 respondents who were using public transport in Addis Ababa. Out of the total, 30.7% of respondents had general anxiety disorder, and being female, daily labor, more than three family sizes, and no face mask use were variables associated with the outcome variable (p < 0.05).

342;Effect of cooling strategies on overall performance of a hybrid personal cooling system incorporated with phase change materials (PCMs) and electric fans.;10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102655;The effect of four cooling strategies on cooling performance of a hybrid personal cooling system (HPCS) incorporated with phase change materials (PCMs) and electric fans in a hot environment (i.e., Tair = 36 ± 0.5 °C, RH = 59 ± 5%) was investigated. Twelve healthy young male participants underwent four 90-min trials comprising 70 min walking and 20 min resting periods. Cooling strategies adopted in this work were CON (control), PCM-control (PCMs were removed at the end of exercise), Fan-control (fans were switched OFF during the initial 20 min) and PCM&Fan-control (fans were turned ON after 20 min exercising and PCMs were removed after the 70-min exercise). Results demonstrated that the control of electric fans could suppress the mean skin temperature rise to 34.0 °C by over 15 min and also cut down the energy consumption of the HPCS from 15.6 W h to 12.1 W h over the entire 90-min trials. Thus, it is recommended that fans should be turned off at the beginning of hot exposure and switched on once participants felt warm. Our findings also showed that the removal of fully melted PCM packs from the HPCS could enhance the evaporative cooling effect brought about by air circulation. The removal of melted PCMs significantly reduced the physical load by 37.3% and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were decreased by 3.5-4.2 RPE units. This could also help quickly restore the PCM energy for future usage. In summary, cooling strategies demonstrated in this work could improve HPCS's overall cooling performance on workers while working in the studied hot environment.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888559/";01/08/2020;control;0.9949
343;A COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index to drive precision policy in the US;10.1101/2021.05.19.21257455;Background: In April 2020 we released the US COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to bring to life vulnerability to health, economic, and social impact of COVID-19 at the state, county, and census tract level. Here we describe the methodology, how vulnerability is distributed across the U.S., and assess the impact on vulnerable communities over the first year of the pandemic. Methods: The index combines 40 indicators into seven themes, drawing on both public and proprietary data. We associate timeseries of COVID-19 cases, deaths, test site access, and rental arrears with vulnerability. Results: Although overall COVID-19 vulnerability is concentrated in the South, the seven underlying themes show substantial spatial variability. As of May 13, 2021, the top-third of vulnerable counties have seen 21% more cases and 47% more deaths than the bottom-third of vulnerable counties, despite receiving 27% fewer tests (adjusted for population). Individual vulnerability themes vary over time in their relationship with mortality as the virus swept across the country. Over 20% of households in the top vulnerability tercile have fallen behind on rent. Poorer test site access for rural vulnerable populations early in the pandemic has since been alleviated. Conclusion: The CCVI captures greater risk of health and economic impact. It has enjoyed widespread use in response planning, and we share lessons learned about developing a data-driven tool in the midst of a fast-moving pandemic. The CCVI and an interactive data explorer are available at precisionforcovid.org/ccvi.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.21257455; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.19.21257455v1?rss=1";20/05/2021;Community Vulnerability Index;0.9711
344;Nitric oxide gas inhalation to prevent COVID-2019 in healthcare providers;10.1101/2020.04.05.20054544;Introduction: In human hosts, SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory syndrome (named COVID-19) which can range from a mild involvement of the upper airways to a severe pneumonia with acute respiratory syndrome that requires mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated transmission is an important route of spreading for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and healthcare providers are at the highest risk. As of February 2020, 1716, Chinese healthcare workers had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and at least 6 died. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine or pharmacological prophylaxis to decrease the risk of healthcare providers contracting the infection. Methods and analysis. We will randomize 470 healthcare providers scheduled to work with COVID 19 patients to receive nitric oxide gas administration (NO group, n=235) or no gas administration (control group, n=235). The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of subjects with COVID-19 disease at 14 days from enrollment. Secondary endpoints are the proportion of healthcare providers who present a positive real time RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 14 days after enrollment, the proportion of healthcare providers requiring quarantine, and the total number of quarantine days in the two groups. Ethics and dissemination. The trial protocol is under the approval of The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) and recruitment is expected to start in April 2020. The results of this study will be published in scientific journals and presented at scientific meetings.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054544;11/04/2020;respiratory syndrome;0.9493
345;On predicting the novel COVID-19 human infections by using Infectious Disease modelling method in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu during 2020;10.1101/2020.04.05.20054593;Since the introduction of the novel Corona Virus (The COVID 19) to the Chinese city Wuhan in the Hubei province during the late December 2019, the effectiveness of the deadly disease, its human infection, spreading severity and the mortality rate of the infection has been an issue of debate. The outbreak of the virus along the time has become a massive threat to the global public health security and has been declared as a pandemic. Accounting the radical number of increases in the infected cases and the death due to COVID 19 infections around the globe, there is a need to predict the infections among the people by making proper optimization and using various Infectious Disease modelling (IDM) methods, in order to challenge the outcome. In comparison with previous diseases like SARS and Ebola viruses, the new corona virus (COVID 19) infections are infectious during the incubation period. In addition to that, naturally produced droplets from humans (e.g. droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing) and Person-to-person contact transmission are reported to be the foremost ways of transmission of novel corona virus. By considering the above two factors, a modified SEIR (Susceptibility Exposure Infection Recovery) method have been used for predicting the spread of the infections in the state of Tamil Nadu which is located in the southern part of India. Further, we have utilized the current surveillance data from Health and Family Welfare Department, Government of Tamil Nadu to accurately predict the spreading trend of the infection on a state level.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054593;07/04/2020;Corona Virus;0.958
346;537 Implications of Covid-19 on Vitreoretinal and Cataract Surgery;10.1093/bjs/znab134.065;"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has greatly impacted ophthalmic surgery, including changes to surgical protocols and training. We explored the effects on vitreoretinal and cataract surgeries, which constitute the commonest areas of ophthalmic surgery. METHOD: Literature searches were performed for the terms “vitreoretinal”, and “cataract”, each in combination with “surgery” and “Covid-19”. Relevant results were assessed to determine perceived impact on ophthalmic theatres. RESULTS: 36 search results were analysed; 25 and 11 for cataract and vitreoretinal surgery respectively. Efforts to reduce infection rates have significantly reduced non-urgent operations, with reports of just 5.7% of ophthalmologists in certain areas performing cataract surgeries. Furthermore, surgeons have been advised to perform bilateral cataract surgery, and to combine phacoemulsification with vitreoretinal surgery, thereby avoiding deferred operations and further exposure. Other recommended changes in surgical strategies to enhance safety include three-dimensional heads-up displays for vitreoretinal surgeries, novel microscope drapes, and virtual consultations for surgery follow-up. Various reports indicate a negative impact on junior surgeon training and mental well-being; indeed, The Royal College of Ophthalmology has recommended assigning operations to experienced surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmic surgery rates and protocols have been impacted in the effort to reduce Covid-19 spread.

347;Geographical identification of the vulnerable groups during COVID-19 crisis: the typhoon eye effect and its boundary conditions;10.1101/2020.04.28.20083667;"Although some studies suggest the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with negative consequences on physical health, our knowledge about the detrimental effects of COVID-19 on individual mental health is still nascent. This study uses typhoon eye theory to offer insights in helping clinical psychiatrists to screen people with well-being issues during COVID-19 outbreak. We collected survey data from working adults across different geographical areas in China on 20 and 21 February 2020 during the outbreak of COVID-19. The sample contains 308 working adults, who were in various parts of China, with varying distance to the epicenter of Wuhan. The distance of individual adults to the epicenter was negatively associated with life satisfaction ({beta} = -0.235, 95% CI -0.450 to -0.020, p = 0.032). This association between distance and life satisfaction was significant only for adults who were young or had smaller family sizes. For example, the negative relationship was strongest when the individuals were in the age bracket of 20 years old (15.7%; {beta} = -0.703, 95% CI -1.098 to -0.307; p = 0.001) and single (32.3%; {beta} = -0.767, 95% CI -1.125 to -0.408; p < 0.001). Our results that well-being deteriorates by the distance from the epicenter for specific groups of people help guide mental healthcare providers towards the regions that are further away from the epicenter in the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.

348;Research on substance use disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic();10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108385;"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered changes in the substance use disorder (SUD) treatment delivery system, in the availability of legal and illicit drugs, and in other social and economic factors. As such, these changes necessitate that the field re-evaluate research approaches to SUDs, including in epidemiology, clinical trials, health services, implementation and policy research, as well as basic and translational neuroscience. COVID-19 has reduced researchers' access to target populations and made it difficult for them to obtain timely data to monitor changes in patterns of drug use and overdoses. These changes have increased researchers' interest in virtual technologies to expand and accelerate access to populations; increased modifications in the design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials; and increased emphasis on implementation. Similarly, as researchers better understand the biology of COVID-19, they will better understand potential effects of COVID-19 on neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways, mechanisms underlying COVID-19 associated neurological and psychiatric sequelae, and interactions between COVID-19 treatments and psychoactive substances. The pandemic has also revealed the need for research that addresses health disparities. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged several aspects of current research on SUD.

349;Comparative effects of topiroxostat and febuxostat on arterial properties in hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia.;10.1111/jch.14153;"Elevated serum uric acid is a cardiovascular risk factor in patients with hypertension, even when blood pressure (BP) is well controlled. Xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitors (XORi) reduce serum uric acid levels and have several other potential effects. This multicenter, randomized, open-label study compared the effects of two XORi, topiroxostat and febuxostat, on arterial stiffness, uric acid levels, and BP in hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia. Patients received topiroxostat 40-160 mg/day or febuxostat 10-60 mg/day, titrated to maintain serum uric acid <6 mg/dl, for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) from baseline to 24 weeks. There were no significant changes in CAVI from baseline to 24 weeks (from 9.13 to 9.16 [feboxustat] and 8.98 to 9.01 [topiroxostat]). Compared with baseline, there were significant reductions in serum uric acid (-2.9 and -2.5 mg/dl; both p < 0.001) and morning home systolic BP (-3.6 and -5.1 mm Hg; both p < 0.01) after 24 weeks' treatment with febuxostat and topiroxostat. BP decreased to the greatest extent in the subgroup of patients with uncontrolled blood pressure at baseline. Topiroxostat, but not febuxostat, significantly decreased plasma xanthine oxidoreductase activity versus baseline. The urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) decreased significantly from baseline to 24 weeks with topiroxostat (-20.8%; p = 0.021), but not febuxostat (-8.8%; p = 0.362).

Despite the publication of legislation and other measures to address patient safety incidents (PSIs) there are a paucity of studies relating to patient safety at the different levels of hospitals. OBJECTIVES: To determine the epidemiology (incidence, nature and root causes) of PSIs at a long-term rehabilitative hospital between April 2011 and March 2016. METHOD: Data were collected through a review and analysis of routinely collected hospital information on patient records and from the PSI register, as well as minutes of adverse health events meetings, quality assurance reports and patient complaints register. RESULTS: A total or 4.12 PSIs per 10 000 inpatient days were reported. Approximately 52% of the adverse health events occurred in females with most of the adverse health events occurring in the 50–59 years category: 96% being reported during the day and 33% within the shift change. Pressure ulcers, falls, injury, hospital acquired infections and medication error were the most commonly reported PSIs. Patient factors were listed as the most common root cause for the PSIs. CONCLUSION: The study shows a low reporting rate of PSIs whilst showing a diverse pattern of PSIs over a period of 5 years. There is a need for active change management in order to establish a blame-free culture and learning environment to improve reporting of PSI. A comprehensive quality improvement intervention addressing patients, their families and staff is essential to minimise PSI and its consequences.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182556/;18/05/2021;Patient safety;0.9681
351;The potential role of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in reducing acute respiratory inflammation in community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia;10.1186/s12929-020-00680-9;BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) reduces both invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and other pneumococcal infections worldwide. We investigated the impact of stepwise implementation of childhood PCV programs on the prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia, severity of acute inflammation, and associations between breakthrough pneumonia and pneumococcal serotypes in Taiwan. METHODS: In total, 983 children diagnosed with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia were enrolled between January 2010 and December 2015. RESULTS: Proportions of pneumococcal vaccinations increased each year in age-stratified groups with PCV7 (32.2%) as the majority, followed by PCV13 (12.2%). The proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia decreased each year in age-stratified groups, especially in 2–5 year group. Serotype 19A is the leading serotype either in vaccinated (6.4%) or unvaccinated patients (5.2%). In particular, vaccinated patients had significantly higher lowest WBC, lower neutrophils, lower lymphocytes and lower CRP values than non-vaccinated patients (p < 0.05). After stratifying patients by breakthrough infection, those with breakthrough pneumococcal infection with vaccine coverage serotypes had more severe pneumonia disease (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Systematic childhood pneumococcal vaccination reduced the prevalence of community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, especially in 2–5 year group. Serotype 19A was the major serotype for all vaccine types in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and severity of acute inflammatory response was reduced in vaccinated patients.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7435222/;19/08/2020;Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine;0.9123
352;Herd-level risk factors for chronic pleurisy in finishing pigs: a case-control study;10.1186/s40813-020-00156-0;BACKGROUND: Chronic pleurisy is a common finding in slaughtered pigs in post-mortem meat inspection. The prevalence of pleurisy has been increasing during the last decade also in Finland. The aim of this prospective case-control study was to search for environmental, infectious and management-related herd-level risk factors for pleurisy in the slaughterhouse. Altogether 46 Finnish pig herds, including 25 control (low pleurisy prevalence in meat inspection) and 21 case (high pleurisy) herds, were enrolled in the study and visited during the tenth week of the rearing period of finishing pigs. Herd personnel were asked about basic herd information, management and environmental factors. Selected pigs were examined clinically, environmental parameters were measured and 15 blood samples per herd were taken during herd visits. Antibodies against Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia serotype 2 (APP2) and ApxIV toxin and swine influenza virus were measured. After the slaughter of study pigs, meat inspection results of the batch were gathered from slaughterhouses. Multivariate logistic regression model was built to identify possible risk factors for a herd to be a case herd (i.e. having high pleurisy values). RESULTS: Finishing herd type and herd size were observed to act as risk factors. None of clinical signs of pigs, management-related factors or environmental measurements were associated with herd status. CONCLUSIONS: As previously known, in endemic and subclinical infections such as APP, herd factors are important, but detailed risk factors seem to be difficult to identify.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884831/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-020-00156-0";02/09/2020;Chronic pleurisy;0.9412

The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases increased rather rapidly and changed routine daily activities of the community. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This brief report describes the response from the hospital, the regional blood center, and the hospital-based transfusion services to the events that took place in the community during the initial phases of the pandemic. RESULTS In Washington State, the first week of March started with 4 confirmed cases and ended with 150; by the end of the second week of March there were more than 700 cases of confirmed COVID-19. During the first week, blood donations dropped significantly. Blood units provided from blood centers of non-affected areas of the country helped keep inventory stable and allow for routine hospital operations. The hospital-based transfusion service began prospective triaging of blood orders to monitor and prioritize blood utilization. In the second week, blood donations recovered, and the hospital postponed elective procedures to ensure staff and personal protective equipment were appropriate for the care of critical patients.

354;Evaluating new evidence in the early dynamics of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China with real time domestic traffic and potential asymptomatic transmissions;10.1101/2020.02.15.20023440;The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to 28 countries/regions with over 43,000 confirmed cases. Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. The findings of this study depend on the validity of the underlying assumptions, and continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023440;18/02/2020;coronavirus;0.9743
355;Development of a microbial coating for cellulosic surface using aloe vera and silane;10.1016/j.carpta.2020.100015;The highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus has created a havoc effect all over the world in a very short period. The most effective method for precaution of this virus as suggested by WHO is use of PPEs (triple layered face mask, body suits) and social distancing. However, the frontline doctors and medical staff have high risk of exposure to the virus during treatments and removal and discarding of the PPEs. Also the PPEs are of the onetime use and wearing these PPEs in hot and humid seasons is very uncomfortable. A possible solution of this problem is if clothes are anti-bacterial and anti-viral in nature, one single-layered will be sufficient and the spread of virus will also be minimized. Considering this, we have designed a facile and durable anti-wash antimicrobial coating on cloth by aloe vera and hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HDTMS). In lab scale study, present coating shows good chemical and thermal stability making it reusable multiple times even after repeated washing. The coated cloth reveals the excellent anti-dirt and stain resistance properties leading to complete non-adherence of dirt and stain (e.g. Color, food, ink) on it. Anti-bacterial and anti-fungi properties of the coated cloth were confirmed by doing E. coli (bacteria) and A. Niger (fungus) culture studies, respectively. This coating is imbibed with well-known anti-viral agent aloe vera which inhibits the attachment of the virus on the surface. The water-repellent nature of the coating combined with the use anti-viral agent, aloe vera makes it a potential anti-COVID-19 coating.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666893920300153; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666893920300153?v=s5";16/11/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9056
356;An Improved Method of Determining Human Population Distribution Based on Luojia 1-01 Nighttime Light Imagery and Road Network Data—A Case Study of the City of Shenzhen;10.3390/s20185032;Previously published studies on population distribution were based on the provincial level, while the number of urban-level studies is more limited. In addition, the rough spatial resolution of traditional nighttime light (NTL) data has limited their fine application in current small-scale population distribution research. For the purpose of studying the spatial distribution of populations at the urban scale, we proposed a new index (i.e., the road network adjusted human settlement index, RNAHSI) by integrating Luojia 1-01 (LJ 1-01) NTL data, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and road network density (RND) data based on population density relationships to depict the spatial distribution of urban human settlements. The RNAHSI updated the high-resolution NTL data and combined the RND data on the basis of human settlement index (HSI) data to refine the spatial pattern of urban population distribution. The results indicated that the mean relative error (MRE) between the population estimation data based on the RNAHSI and the demographic data was 34.80%, which was lower than that in the HSI and WorldPop dataset. This index is suitable primarily for the study of urban population distribution, as the RNAHSI can clearly highlight human activities in areas with dense urban road networks and can refine the spatial heterogeneity of impervious areas. In addition, we also drew a population density map of the city of Shenzhen with a 100 m spatial resolution for 2018 based on the RNAHSI, which has great reference significance for urban management and urban resource allocation.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899875/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s20185032";04/09/2020;enhanced vegetation index;0.9459
357;Centering the Margins: The Precarity of Bangladeshi Low-Income Migrant Workers During the Time of COVID-19;10.1177/00027642211000397;A global outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) has profoundly escalated social, political, economic, and cultural disparities, particularly among the marginalized migrants of the global South, who historically remained key sufferers from such disparities. Approximately 8 million, such workers from Bangladesh, migrated from their homelands to work in neighboring countries, specifically in Southeast Asia and in the Middle East, and also contribute significantly to their country’s economy. As many of the migrant workers work on temporary visas, scholars have expressed concerns about their physical and psychological health such as joblessness, mortality, abuses, daunting stress, and inhabitable living environment. Embracing the theoretical frameworks of critical–cultural communication, this article explores two research questions: (1) What are the emerging narratives of experiencing realities and disparities among the Bangladeshi migrants at the margins? (2) How the migrants negotiated and worked on overcoming the adversities? In doing so, we have closely examined 85 Facebook Pages (number of subscribers: 10,000-1 million), dedicated to issues of Bangladeshi migrant workers to qualitatively analyze emerging mediated discourses (textual, visual, and audiovisual). Our analysis reveals several aspects, including, (1) impact of job insecurities on migrants and their families, (2) living conditions of and abuses on migrants works, (3) negotiations of mental stress by the marginalized migrants, and (4) how community support helps the migrants to survive during the pandemic.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7969852/;17/03/2021;coronavirus;0.9509

Prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased among adults, adolescents and older children in recent decades. Among countries with the highest prevalence there are signs that the increase is slowing down or even that prevalence is declining. There has been no increase in the prevalence rate in younger children, although the absolute number of children under five years affected by overweight has increased. This review summarizes prevalence data and examines current implementation of regulatory, fiscal and voluntary measures to promote healthy diet across the Region. The last decade has seen a step up in such action. Ten of the Region’s countries have policies relating to trans-fatty acids and they are increasingly implementing specific regulatory measures. Thirteen countries had fully or partially implemented national salt reduction policies by 2019. Only four countries had adopted policies relating to aspects of marketing food to children by 2019, and concrete action in this area is still lacking. Eight countries have introduced taxes—sometimes at a rate of 50%—on carbonated or sugar-sweetened beverages.

This study examines the characteristics of air pollutants, including PM(2.5) (particles with aerodynamic diameters < 2.5 μm), gas pollutants, water-soluble ions (WSIs), black carbon (BC) and elements, as well as the source apportionment of PM(2.5) in Suzhou before, during and after the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday of 2020 (when China was under an unprecedented state of lockdown to restrict the COVID-19 outbreak). Compared to those before CNY, PM(2.5), BC, SNA (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium), other ions, elements, and NO(2) and CO mass concentrations decreased by 9.9%–64.0% during CNY. The lockdown policy had strong (weak) effects on the diurnal variations in aerosol chemical compositions (gas pollutants). Compared to those before CNY, source concentrations and contributions of vehicle exhaust during CNY decreased by 72.9% and 21.7%, respectively. In contrast, increased contributions from coal combustion and industry were observed during CNY, which were recorded to be 2.9 and 1.7 times higher than those before CNY, respectively. This study highlights that the lockdown policy that was imposed in Suzhou during CNY not only reduced the mass concentrations of air pollutants but also modified their diurnal variations and the source contributions of PM(2.5), which revealed the complex responses of PM(2.5) sources to the rare, low emissions of anthropogenic pollutants that occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33373898/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120369876; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0269749120369876; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.116298";15/02/2021;coronavirus;0.9099
360;High expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on tissue macrophages that may be targeted by virus SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients;10.1101/2020.07.18.210120;Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been recognized as the binding receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that infects host cells, causing the development of the new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19). To better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and build up the host anti-viral immunity, we examined the levels of ACE2 expression on different types of immune cells including tissue macrophages. Flow cytometry demonstrated that there was little to no expression of ACE2 on most of the human peripheral blood-derived immune cells including CD4+ T, CD8+ T, activated CD4+ T, activated CD8+ T, CD4+CD25+CD127low/− regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th17 cells, NKT cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and granulocytes. Additionally, there was no ACE2 expression (< 1%) found on platelets. Compared with interleukin-4-treated type 2 macrophages (M2), the ACE2 expression was markedly increased on the activated type 1 macrophages (M1) after the stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that high expressions of ACE2 were colocalized with tissue macrophages, such as alveolar macrophages found within the lungs and Kupffer cells within livers of mice. Flow cytometry confirmed the very low level of ACE2 expression on human primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. These data indicate that alveolar macrophages, as the frontline immune cells, may be directly targeted by the SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore need to be considered for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.18.210120;19/07/2020;coronavirus infectious disease;0.9466
361;Therapeutic targets in lung tissue remodelling and fibrosis.;10.1016/j.pharmthera.2021.107839;"Structural changes involving tissue remodelling and fibrosis are major features of many pulmonary diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is a key factor in the development of tissue remodelling that results in symptoms and impaired lung function in these diseases. Tissue remodelling in the lungs is complex and differs between compartments. Some pathways are common but tissue remodelling around the airways and in the parenchyma have different morphologies. Hence it is critical to evaluate both common fibrotic pathways and those that are specific to different compartments; thereby expanding the understanding of the pathogenesis of fibrosis and remodelling in the airways and parenchyma in asthma, COPD and IPF with a view to developing therapeutic strategies for each. Here we review the current understanding of remodelling features and underlying mechanisms in these major respiratory diseases. The differences and similarities of remodelling are used to highlight potential common therapeutic targets and strategies. One central pathway in remodelling processes involves transforming growth factor (TGF)-β induced fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation that increases ECM production. The current treatments and clinical trials targeting remodelling are described, as well as potential future directions. These endeavours are indicative of the renewed effort and optimism for drug discovery targeting tissue remodelling and fibrosis.";"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2021.107839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33774068/";24/03/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9808

We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and undergoing swab tests for SARS-CoV-2. Complete blood counts (CBCs) were analysed looking for predictors of test positivity. Eight significant predictors were identified and used to build a 'complete' CBC score with a discriminatory power for COVID-19 diagnosis of AUC 92% (p<0.0001). When looking at the weight of individual variables, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), age, platelets and eosinophils (MAPE: MCV ≤90 fL, 65 points; age ≥45 years, 100 points; platelets ≤180×103/μL, 73 points; eosinophils <0.01/μL, 94 points) gave the highest contribution and were used to build a 'simplified' MAPE score with a discriminatory power of AUC 88%. By setting the cut-off MAPE score at ≥173 points, sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 diagnosis were 83% and 82%, respectively, and the actual test positivity rate was 60% as compared to 6% of patients with MAPE score <173 points (odds ratio 23.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.1-58.3, p-value <0.0001).

363;Acute liver injury and its association with death risk of patients with COVID-19: a hospital-based prospective case-cohort study;10.1101/2020.04.02.20050997;Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with multiple organ injuries. The aim of this study was to analyze SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver injury (ALI), its association with death risk and prognosis after discharge. Methods: Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. ALI was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between ALI and death risk was analyzed. Results: Of 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 were common, 88 severe, and 51 critical ill cases, respectively. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients were with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, ALI was more common in critical ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and lymphocyte reduction were three important independent risk factors predicting ALI among COVID-19 patients. Death risk analysis shows that fatality rate was higher among patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia (RR=9.471, P<0.001). Moreover, fatality rate was higher among patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (RR=2.182, P<0.05). Follow-up observation found that more than one hepatic functional indexes of two-third patients remained abnormal 14 days after discharge. Conclusions: ALI at early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI has not recovered completely 14 days after discharge.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050997;06/04/2020;ALI;0.9117
364;How the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the economics of U.S. emergency care;10.1101/2020.12.12.20248102;Objective: We describe how the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic impacted emergency department (ED) economics, acuity, and staffing. Methods: We conducted an observational study of visits during January to September 2020 compared to 2019 in 136 EDs staffed by a national emergency medicine group. We created ratios of three-week moving averages for 2020 visits, acuity, costs divided by 2019 moving averages, by age and ED size. We tabulated reductions in clinician hours and FTEs compared to early 2020 staffing. Results: 2020-2019 ED visit ratios declined in March nadiring mid-April for both adults (to 0.60) and children (to 0.30) and rose thereafter but remained below 2019 levels through September 2020. The ratio of adult RVUs/visit rose to 1.1 for adults and 1.2 for children in the early pandemic, falling to 1.04 and 1.1 through September. The ratio of direct salary expenses in freestanding (FSED) and small EDs declined less dramatically than in medium and large EDs. Clinical revenues in medium and large EDs declined more sharply and recovered slowly but plateaued well below 2019 levels. By September 2020, expenses were still higher than revenues for small EDs, similar for FSEDs, and somewhat higher for medium and large EDs. During the pandemic, physician hours fell 15% and APP hours 27% during COVID-19 translating to 174 lost physician and 193 lost APP FTEs. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic reduced ED visits and increased acuity in the first 7 months of the pandemic, leading to a contraction of the ED workforce, and threatening ED economics, more so in small and FSEDs.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.12.20248102; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.12.20248102v1?rss=1";14/12/2020;coronavirus;0.9475

However, the inherent demands of the profession and the work conditions within ECE settings affect job satisfaction and overall health and well-being. This study applied the Job Demands-Resources Model (JD-R) and administered a cross-sectional survey (n = 137) to examine disparities in personal and external demands and resources that may impact job satisfaction and turnover rates among ECE staff who provide care for preschool children (3–5 years of age). ECE staff reported higher levels of personal demands, including depression and perceived stress, and external demands, including workload and staffing concerns, compared to the national workforce (all p < .01). The data also illustrated disparities related to resource access; ECE staff reported lower levels of personal resources, including mindfulness, and less access to external resources including safety climate, resource adequacy, role clarity, respect, and management relationships (all p < .01). Only 34% of ECE staff reported being very satisfied with their work compared to 49% of the national workforce (p < .01). External resources were significantly and positively associated with job satisfaction (B = .09, p < .01). These findings suggest that ECE staff experience significantly higher demands and have access to significantly fewer resources in the workplace, and that bolstering job-related resources may translate to increased job satisfaction.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7784221/;05/01/2021;Job Demands-Resources Model;0.957
366;Towards a High-Fidelity Assessment of Urban Green Spaces Walking Accessibility;10.1007/978-3-030-58811-3_39;Urban Public Green Spaces (UPGS) available at walking distance are a vital component of urban quality of life, of citizens’ health, and ultimately of the right to the city. Their demand has suddenly become even more ostensive due to the measures of “social distancing” and the restrictions of movement imposed in many countries during the COVID-19 outbreak, showing the importance of the public urban parks and green open spaces located near homes and accessible by foot. Hence, the idea of “green self-sufficiency” at the local, neighbourhood and sub-neighbourhood level has emerged as a relevant objective to pursue. For this purpose, we have constructed a high-fidelity evaluation model to assess the walking accessibility of UPGS at the highly granular spatial scale of street network nodes. The evaluation procedure is based on a novel index constructed around the concept of distance-cumulative deficit, scoring nodes with respect to all the available UPGS within their catchment area of slope-corrected walking distance of 2 km. To showcase the possible outputs of the evaluation procedure and their exploratory analyses, we present an application on the city of Cagliari, Italy. In doing that, we argue that the proposed evaluation approach is an advancement over the traditional (density-based) approaches of assessment of green area availability, and that it provides an intuitive, flexible and extendable tool useful to better evaluate and understand the current and the potential accessibility of urban green space, and to support urban planning, policy making and design.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974652/;19/08/2020;Urban Public Green Spaces;0.9052
367;Mask-induced Artifact Impacts Intraocular Pressure Measurement Using Goldmann Applanation Tonometry.;10.1097/ijg.0000000000001746;PURPOSE The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted ophthalmology practices significantly. American Academy of Ophthalmology and Center for Disease Control guidelines suggest mandatory masking of patients and physicians during outpatient visits. We have recently become aware of a mask-induced phenomenon, whereby the intraocular pressure (IOP) as measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) is artificially elevated due to mechanical interference from the mask. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 37-year-old male with a history of primary open-angle glaucoma on triple therapy presented for a routine visit. CLINICAL FINDINGS When measuring IOP by GAT the right eye measured 16 mm Hg, but the left eye measured 20 mm Hg. The patient's mask was noted to be touching the base of the sensor rod on the tonometer. This patient's IOP was falsely elevated due to the lateral edge of his mask touching the base of the applanation tonometer, changing the relationship between the bi-prism tip and the weighted balance below, and eliminating the weighted balance from the pressure measuring mechanism. The patient's mask was adjusted to ensure there was no touch and repeat measurement showed an IOP of 16 mm Hg in the left eye. CONCLUSION Recognizing mask-induced alteration in IOP is essential as it could lead to unnecessary escalation of treatment. We recommend flattening the area of mask protrusion during applanation and ensuring that the sensor arm remains clear of the mask while the tonometer tip approaches the cornea, especially at the moment the mires become visible during corneal contact.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33273280/";02/12/2020;coronavirus;0.9828
368;Obstetric Healthcare Workers’ Adherence to Hand Hygiene Recommendations during the COVID‐19 Pandemic: Observations and Social‐Cognitive Determinants;10.1111/aphw.12240;BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene is crucial to avoid healthcare‐associated infections and the transmission of COVID‐19. Although the WHO has issued global hand hygiene recommendations for healthcare, adherence remains challenging. Considering social‐cognitive theories such as the health action process approach (HAPA) can help to improve healthcare workers’ adherence. This study aimed to observe adherence and to assess determinants in obstetric hospitals during and after the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: In all, 267 observations of behaviour were conducted in two German obstetric university hospitals over three time periods (pre‐COVID‐19 pandemic, heightened awareness, and strict precautions). In addition, 115 healthcare workers answered questionnaires regarding social‐cognitive determinants of hand hygiene behaviour. Multiple regression and multiple mediation analyses were used to analyse associations. RESULTS: Adherence to hand hygiene recommendations increased from 47 per cent pre‐COVID‐19 pandemic to 95 per cent just before lockdown while simple measures against the pandemic were taken. Self‐efficacy was associated with the intention to sanitise hands (β = .397, p < .001). Coping self‐efficacy mediated the association of intention with hand hygiene adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Obstetric healthcare workers seem to adapt their hand hygiene behaviour to prevent infections facing the global COVID‐19 pandemic. To further improve interventions, social‐cognitive determinants should be considered, especially intention and (coping) self‐efficacy.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33016518/; https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12240";05/10/2020;Hand hygiene;0.976
369;Ovarian vein thrombosis in the postnatal period.;10.1136/bcr-2021-243872;Although ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is classically considered a puerperal pathology, it can also occur in nonpuerperal settings such as endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, Crohn's disease, pelvic or gynaecological surgeries and thrombophilia. Hypercoagulation conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, factor V Leiden and protein C and S deficiency are all recognised risk factors. It is also a known complication during pregnancy often presenting with fever and lower abdominal pain within weeks after delivery. Its incidence is exceedingly rare, occurring in 0.05% of all pregnancies that result in live births and peaking around 2-6 days after delivery. Its preferential involvement of the right ovarian vein may be explained by the compression of the inferior vena cava and the right ovarian vein due to dextrorotation of the uterus during pregnancy. Furthermore, antegrade flow of blood and multiple incompetent valves in the right ovarian vein favours bacterial infection. Complications may include sepsis and thrombus extension to the inferior vena cava or left renal vein and rarely, pulmonary embolism. The authors present the case of a 27-year-old woman with lower abdominal pain 5 weeks after an elective caesarean section. Although the diagnosis of postpartum endometritis was initially considered, a CT suggested a right OVT. She commenced treatment with low-molecular weight heparin. A high index of clinical suspicion is required in order to establish the diagnosis of this rare cause of abdominal pain, which can mimic an acute abdomen.;"https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-243872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34172481/";25/06/2021;ovarian vein thrombosis;0.9585
370;Effect of bifurcation in the hemodynamic changes and rupture risk of small intracranial aneurysm.;10.1007/s10143-020-01367-3;The role of bifurcations is prominent in the intracranial aneurysm (IA) evaluation, and there are many contradictions and complexities in the rupture risk of small IA. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of bifurcation on the manner of hemodynamic changes and the rupture risk of the small middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm is investigated. 3D anatomical models of the MCAs of 21 healthy subjects, 19 patients/IA/bifurcation, and 19 patients/IA were generated, and the models were analyzed by the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. The presence of bifurcation in the pathway of the blood flow in the parent artery of healthy subjects has reduced the maximum velocity, flow rate, and wall shear stress (WSS) by 25.8%, 38.6%, and 11.1%, respectively. The bifurcation decreased the maximum velocity and flow rate in the neck and sac of the aneurysm by 1.65~2.1 times, respectively. It increased the maximum WSS, and phase lag between the WSS graph of healthy subjects and patients by 12.8%~13.9% and 10.2%~40.4%, respectively. The effect of bifurcation on the Womersley number change in the aneurysm was insignificant, and the blood flow was in the laminar flow condition in all samples. The results also showed bifurcation increased the phase lag between the flow rate and pressure gradient graphs up to approximately 1.5 times. The rupture prediction index for patients/IA/bifurcation and patients/IA was 62.1%(CV = 4.1) and 51.8%(CV = 4.4), respectively. Thus, in equal conditions, the presence of bifurcation increased the probability of the rupture of the aneurysm by 19.9%.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-020-01367-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803404/";16/08/2020;computational fluid dynamic;0.9323

373;Monocytopenia, monocyte morphological anomalies and hyperinflammation characterise severe COVID‐19 in type 2 diabetes;10.15252/emmm.202013038;Early in the COVID‐19 pandemic, type 2 diabetes (T2D) was marked as a risk‐factor for severe disease and mortality. Inflammation is central to the aetiology of both conditions where variations in immune responses can mitigate or aggravate disease course. Identifying at‐risk groups based on immuno‐inflammatory signatures is valuable in directing personalised care and developing potential targets for precision therapy. This observational study characterised immunophenotypic variation associated with COVID‐19 severity in T2D. Broad‐spectrum immunophenotyping quantified 15 leukocyte populations in peripheral circulation from a cohort of 45 hospitalised COVID‐19 patients with and without T2D. Lymphocytopenia and specific loss of cytotoxic CD8(+) lymphocytes was associated with severe COVID‐19 and requirement for intensive care in both non‐diabetic and T2D patients. A morphological anomaly of increased monocyte size and monocytopenia restricted to classical CD14(Hi) CD16(‐) monocytes were specifically associated with severe COVID‐19 in patients with T2D requiring intensive care. Increased expression of inflammatory markers reminiscent of the type‐1 interferon pathway (IL6, IL8, CCL2, INFB1) underlaid the immunophenotype associated with T2D. These immunophenotypic and hyperinflammatory changes may contribute to increased voracity of COVID‐19 in T2D. These findings allow precise identification of T2D patients with severe COVID‐19 as well as provide evidence that the type‐1 interferon pathway may be an actionable therapeutic target for future studies.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32816392/; https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.202013038";20/08/2020;type 2 diabetes;0.9161

We are taking into consideration literature related to the term resilience and compile information from local tour operators in order to demonstrate the crisis, the promotion means used, and the option to implement virtual reality in such promotion. Results show that the closure of borders directly affect this area since foreign visitors represent 95% of tourists, so meeting the 80 activities being offered, as well as the specialized culinary services, and the variety of hotels from big and small businesspeople, is affected. Confinement represents a barrier for the national tourist, but it becomes an opportunity for a personalized promotion.

Vaccinated individuals as a potential source of transmission.;10.1111/eci.13544;Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has shown to offer effective protection against Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in persons 16 years of age or older in different trials [1,2], but its role against SARS-CoV-2 infection, determining subsequent positivity to real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab test is still unknown. Indeed, though being one of the greatest achievements reached by the scientific community in the last century, these trials did not address whether vaccinations succeeded to prevent asymptomatic infections. Only recently, plaque reduction neutralization testing was used to demonstrate that the BNT162b2 vaccine was capable to neutralize new highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the S gene, detected in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7 lineage), South Africa (B.1.351 lineage), and Brazil (P.1 lineage) [3]. Nevertheless, knowing if vaccination may as well prevent SARS-CoV-2 spreading is of the outmost importance especially among healthcare workers (HCWs), who are known to be at high risk of transmitting the viral disease in the hospital setting [4]. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections have been poorly described [5], but cases of swab test positivity after the vaccination have been often reported by mass media nowadays, along with concerns that vaccinated individuals could still transmit SARS-CoV-2 after COVID-19 vaccination [6].

376;Spontaneous acute epidural hematoma associated with chronic subdural hematoma due to dural metastasis of gastric carcinoma: A case report and literature review.;10.1080/00207454.2020.1744599;BACKGROUND: Non-traumatic spontaneous acute epidural hematoma（EDH） happening to chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) caused by dural metastases is a rare entity. Pathogenesis can be derived from infection, coagulopathy, and inflammation. Malignant tumors metastasize to dura mater is one of the most infrequent causes. The exact mechanism remains elusive in spite of several possible speculations. The clinical manifestations, management and outcomes vary among reported cases.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old woman without history of trauma presented with headache, vomiting and disturbance of consciousness and developed brain hernia rapidly. On arival, she has lost into coma with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score 5, bilateral pupils were not equal, with disappeared reflectance. Emergency imaging prompted large acute EDH, combined with SDH, arising from dural granular neoplasm confirmed intraoperatively. Four days after surgery, the bilateral pupils were equal in size and sensitive to light reflection.CONCLUSION: Dural metastases can cause EDH, chronic SDH can also be resulted from metastatic tumors of dura mater. When dealing with spontaneous non-traumatic hematoma around the dura mater, to make the precise diagnosis is sometimes doubtful and confusing. The stream of diagnostic thinking should be opened, including medical diseases such as liver and kidney disease, drug history, history of cancer and other possible clues. Thus, a detailed and purposeful systematic medical history review and physical examination is important in order to make more appropriate strategies for the clinic.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2020.1744599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32186217/";18/03/2020;Non-traumatic spontaneous acute epidural hematoma;0.9349
377;Impact of Meteorological factors and population size on the transmission of Micro-size respiratory droplets based Coronavirus: A brief study of highly infected cities in Pakistan;10.1101/2020.07.14.20153544;Ongoing Coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19) identified first in Wuhan, China posed huge impact on public health and economy around the globe. Both cough and sneeze based droplets or aerosols encapsulated COVID-19 particles are responsible for air borne transmission of this virus and caused unexpected escalation and high mortality worldwide. Current study intends to investigate correlation of COVID-19 epidemic with meteorological parameters particularly, temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed along with population size. Data set of COVID-19 for highly infected cities of Pakistan was collected from the official website of National Institute of health (NIH). Spearman rank (rs) correlation coefficient test employed for data analysis revealed significant correlation between temperature minimum (TM), temperature average (TA), wind speed (WS) and population size (PS) with COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to analyze the sensitivity of TA, WS, and PS on transmission rate of COVID-19 in selected cities of Pakistan. The results obtained for sensitivity and specificity analysis for all selected parameters signifies sensitivity and direct correlation of COVID-19 transmission with temperature variation, WS and PS. Positive correlation and strong association of PS parameter with COVID-19 pandemic suggested need of more strict actions and control measures for highly populated cities. These findings will be helpful for health regulatory authorities and policymakers to take specific measures to combat COVID-19 epidemic in Pakistan.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153544; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.14.20153544v1?rss=1";17/07/2020;Coronavirus epidemic;0.917
378;Laparoscopic Caudate Lobectomy for Cholangiocarcinoma of Caudate Lobe Invading Middle Hepatic Vein.;10.1245/s10434-020-08577-5;BACKGROUND Laparoscopic hepatectomy has gained popularity in the management of malignant liver lesions in the past decade. Its safety and feasibility, with faster recovery and comparable long-term outcomes, have been widely published. Nonetheless, laparoscopic isolated caudate lobectomy is still rare and technically demanding. We herein present a video on laparoscopic total caudate lobectomy for caudate cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS The patient is a 61-year-old man who presented with epigastric distending discomfort. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing a 4.6 × 3.9 cm tumor in the caudate lobe adjacent to the inferior vena cava, middle hepatic vein, right hepatic vein, as well as the bifurcation of the main trunk of the portal pedicle. The carbohydrate antigen was elevated to 54.58 U/ml (normal < 37 U/ml), and his liver function was normal. With the preoperative diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, laparoscopic caudate lobectomy was contemplated. RESULTS The operative time was 300 min. The estimated intraoperative blood loss was 180 ml. The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day without any complications. Histopathological examination showed a 4.2 cm cholangiocarcinoma (T2N0M0) with a negative margin. He received a course of adjuvant chemotherapy. No recurrence was noted upon follow-up at 6 months after the operation. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resection for caudate lobe is a feasible and safe procedure. An experienced hepatobiliary surgeon could perform the procedure in selected cases, even with hepatic vein invasion.;"https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08577-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418077/";16/05/2020;Laparoscopic hepatectomy;0.9522

As of August 22, 2020, the pandemic infected more than 23,329,752 including 807,054 patients who have died. Although the main clinical features of the pandemic disease are respiratory, cerebrovascular comorbidities emerged as one of the leading causes of death associated with COVID-19. Different case reports have indicated that C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer (pro-inflammatory biomarkers) were elevated in COVID-19 patients, which can significantly increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Available data on cerebrovascular complications in COVID-19 patients were collected and a meta-analysis was designed and carried out to evaluate the risk of severity and mortality associated with high levels of CRP and D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we aimed to describe the overall event rate of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 patients. In our analysis, 5,614 cases have been studied, out of these patients 164 cases have developed cerebrovascular comorbities. Cerebrovascular comorbidity increased the risk of disease severity (odd ratio = 4.4; 95% CI: 1.48 to 12.84) and mortality (odd ratio = 7.0; 95% CI: 2.56 to 18.99). Statistical analyses showed that CRP and D-dimer serum levels were elevated by six-folds in the severe cases of COVID-19 patients.

380;Impacts of nitrogen practices on yield, grain quality and nitrogen use efficiency of crops and soil fertility in three paddy-upland cropping systems.;10.1002/jsfa.10841;BACKGROUND Global food security faces a number of challenges due to increasing population, climate change and urbanization while excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers has become a major challenge for sustainable intensive agriculture. Assessing the impact of agronomic management practices on seed yield, grain quality and soil fertility is a critical step in understanding nutrient use efficiency. RESULT The comprehensive evaluation index had good fitness to that of single attribute, indicating that the comprehensive evaluation index was superior and reliable. Applying controlled release urea (rice in wheat and oilseed rape field: 150 kg N ha-1 , the other crops: 120 kg N ha-1 ) plus common urea (30 kg N ha-1 ) incorporated with straw from the previous season across the growing season for cereal and oilseed crop showed a slight improvement in seed productivity and N use efficiency among three cropping systems in the traditional evaluation method. Compared with the local farm practice (applying common urea of 150 kg N ha-1 ), applying the practices in combination based on the outcome of the comprehensive evaluation index method decreased the seed yield by -1.27~29.8%, but improved quality and soil fertility for paddy-upland cropping system, respectively. CONCLUSION Properly managing N application by applying partial and full controlled release urea with or without straw incorporation for a specific crop system has the potential to be a better compromise among yield, grain quality and soil fertility in southern China.

381;Evidence for Use or Disuse of Renin-Angiotensin System Modulators in Patients Having COVID-19 With an Underlying Cardiorenal Disorder.;10.1177/1074248420921720;Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization due to an exponential rise in the number of infected and deceased persons across the globe. Emerging reports suggest that susceptibility and mortality rates are higher in patients with certain comorbidities when compared to the average population. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are important risk factors for a lethal outcome of COVID-19. Extensive research ensuing the outbreak of coronavirus-related severe acute respiratory syndrome in the year 2003, and COVID-19 recently revealed a role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in the entry of coronavirus wherein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had garnered the significant attention. This raises the question whether the use of RAS inhibitors, the backbone of treatment of cardiovascular, neurovascular, and kidney diseases could increase the susceptibility for coronavirus infection or unfortunate outcomes of COVID-19. Thus, currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effects of RAS inhibitors in such patients. Moreover, expert bodies like American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and so on have now released official statements that RAS inhibitors must be continued, unless suggested otherwise by a physician. In this brief review, we will elaborate on the role of RAS and ACE2 in pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, we will discuss the potential effect of the use and disuse of RAS inhibitors in patients having COVID-19 with cardiometabolic comorbidities.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/1074248420921720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32351121/";30/04/2020;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9864
382;Self-obtained vaginal swabs are not inferior to provider-performed endocervical sampling for Emergency Department diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis.;10.1111/acem.14213;STUDY OBJECTIVE Provider-performed endocervical sampling (PPES) in the diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) may be difficult to perform in a busy emergency department (ED) due to patient preference, availability of the pelvic examination room, or provider availability. Our objective was to assess if self-obtained vaginal swabs (SOVS) were noninferior to PPES in the ED diagnosis of NG/CT using a rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). METHODS We conducted a prospective observational cohort study in a single ED. Participants were adult female English and Spanish-speaking patients in whom the ED provider felt NG/CT testing was warranted. Each patient had SOVS and PPES performed. For SOVS, a research associate reviewed a one-page handout describing the procedure but gave no other assistance. Patients answered survey questions regarding acceptability of SOVS and symptomatology. We established a minimum sensitivity of 90% for SOVS to be considered clinically noninferior to standard PPES. RESULTS 533 patients completed enrollment and answered survey questions, and 515 who had lab results for both SOVS and PPES. There were 86 patients with a positive result: 29 with NG, 47 with CT, and 10 with coinfection. SOVS had a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI, 88%-99%) for the detection of NG/CT when compared to PPES. SOVS were felt to be an acceptable collection method in 93% of patients and 75% preferred SOVS to PPES. CONCLUSION SOVS are noninferior to PPES in NG/CT diagnosis using a rapid NAAT in ED patients and surveys indicate high patient acceptability.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33460481/";18/01/2021;endocervical sampling;0.908
383;Psychological impact of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on nurses.;10.1111/jjns.12417;AIM The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has laid unprecedented stress on healthcare workers and especially nurses. The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the contributing factors. METHODS A cross-sectional and descriptive correlational design using Qualtrics® software was performed. Data were collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale. RESULTS Of the 1,130 nurses who participated, 75.6% (n = 854) reported stress, 44.2% (n = 499) reported anxiety, 38.5% (n = 435) reported depression and 73.7% (n = 833) reported poor sleep. Stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance (p < .05) were significantly associated with age, marital status, comorbidity and whether family members or relatives were suspected or confirmed with COVID-19. The stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance were significantly positively corelated with each other. Logistic regression showed nurses in the age group between 18 and 30, who worked at the frontline, were at a higher risk of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance. CONCLUSIONS Stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance are significant problems for nurses working in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate interventions to monitor and reduce psychological problems and sleep disturbance among nurses are needed, which can help to support nurses' work during contagious disease outbreaks.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/jjns.12417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33749144/";21/03/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9442
384;Anxiety, Difficulties, and Coping of Infertile Women;10.3390/healthcare9040466;The present study aims to highlight how women perceive and adapt to infertility difficulties. To better understand the difficulties that women diagnosed with infertility are experiencing, the study explores this concept in correlation with anxiety and coping. 240 women with fertility problems from various parts of Romania completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Form Y), Brief COPE and the scale “Difficulties With Infertility and Its Treatment.” Statistical analyzes showed that women who were at the beginning of treatment obtained higher scores on the anxiety [F(2,237) = 4.76, p = 0.009] and on the difficulties scale [F(2,237) = 3.53, p = 0.031], compared to participants who resorted to repeated fertilization procedures. It is important to emphasize that there is a significant positive correlation between the perception of infertility difficulties and coping, and also between difficulties and state anxiety. Regarding the relationship between state anxiety and coping, there were significant positive associations between maladaptive coping strategies and state anxiety, while adaptive strategies were negatively associated with state anxiety. In addition, regarding coping strategies, venting and self-blame occurred predominantly in women who know that the cause of infertility is female-related. These findings draws attention to the fact that infertile women live this experience at very high levels of anxiety, using quite a few adaptive coping mechanisms. These results highlight the need to investigate ways to reduce anxiety and optimizing adaptive coping strategies.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920767/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9040466";15/04/2021;Brief;0.9208

Available literature states that imaging findings in children are similar but less pronounced. The aim of this study is to describe and illustrate the chest computer tomography (CT) features of pediatric COVID-19. RESULTS: This retrospective study was based on the review of all the chest CTs performed in pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease between March 8th and May 26th 2020 (n = 24). The presence of comorbidities and coinfection was assessed, as well as timing of CT examination in relation to the onset of symptoms. CT findings were categorized as typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative for COVID-19 according to International Expert Consensus Statement on Chest Imaging in Pediatric COVID-19 Patient Management. This study found that CT findings were abnormal in 17 (71%) patients, with 5 (21%), 9 (38%), and 3 (13%) patients considered to have typical, indeterminate, and atypical findings, respectively. The most common CT patterns were multiple ground-glass opacities (58%), followed by consolidations (50%). Six patients showed predominantly peripheral distribution of parenchymal abnormalities. A halo sign was identified in 3 patients and a perilobular pattern was identified in one of the cases with typical findings. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT findings in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be subtle or absent. Besides recognizing typical findings, radiologists should be able to identify features that favor different or concomitant diagnosis.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989716/;24/03/2021;2019 coronavirus disease;0.9094

Articles reporting two studies were recently retracted from prestigious journals for reasons including the (thus far) unverifiable provenance of data. This commentary adopts a health information management lens to focus on aspects of data in one of the studies (investigating the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19). THE ISSUES Referencing the Australian context, the current article considers some of the study's reported hospital administrative and coded data categories within the context of Australian hospitals' health information management practices. It highlights potential risks associated with the collection and interpretation of 'big' health data. IMPLICATIONS This article identifies pitfalls that confront researchers undertaking multi-country studies and the need to consider country-specific: (i) collected administrative data items; (ii) health information-related ethical, legal and management policy constraints on the use of confidential hospital records and derived data; and (iii) differences in health classification systems and versions used in the coding of diagnoses and related procedures, interventions and health behaviours.

Small animal models that reproduce key elements of SARS-CoV-2 human infections are needed to rigorously screen candidate drugs to mitigate severe disease and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have reported that transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) viral receptor under the control of the Keratin 18 (K18) promoter develop severe and lethal respiratory disease subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge. Here we report that some infected mice that survive challenge have residual pulmonary damages and persistent brain infection on day 28 post-infection despite the presence of anti-SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Because of the hypersensitivity of K18-hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 and the propensity of virus to infect the brain, we sought to determine if anti-infective biologics could protect against disease in this model system. We demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma protects K18-hACE2 against severe disease. All control mice succumbed to disease by day 7; however, all treated mice survived infection without observable signs of disease. In marked contrast to control mice, viral antigen and lesions were reduced or absent from lungs and absent in brains of antibody-treated mice. Our findings support the use of K18-hACE2 mice for protective efficacy studies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 medical countermeasures (MCMs).

388;Thermal Effects of Percutaneous Application of Plasma/Radiofrequency Energy on Porcine Dermis and Fibroseptal Network.;10.1111/jocd.13845;BACKGROUND Skin laxity is one of the defining characteristics of aging and can be the result of various factors including intrinsic aging, genetics, diet, stress, lifestyle, sun exposure, weight fluctuations, and smoking. Recent reports suggest the ability of subdermal energy application to reduce skin laxity. Thermal energy can be delivered using different devices including lasers, radiofrequency (RF) monopolar and bipolar devices, and plasma/RF devices. Plasma-based energy platforms generate a plasma gas, allowing heat to be applied to the tissue. This study focused on the evaluation of thermal effect of plasma/RF compared to a monopolar RF device applied percutaneously to the subdermis and connective fibroseptal network in a porcine model. METHODS The subdermal application of energy was conducted using a plasma/RF system and a monopolar RF system. Both low and high energy/temperature settings were evaluated in dynamic and stationary modes. Histomorphometry was used to determine the depth of thermal effect associated with each treatment setting. RESULTS Both dermis and fibroseptal network tissue exhibited the presence of microscopically thermally treated zones. There were no significant differences in average and maximum depths of thermal effect between the different handpieces and electrosurgical systems used for all treatment settings. CONCLUSIONS No significant differences in the thermal effect between plasma/RF and monopolar RF systems were observed, suggesting that plasma/RF systems can be safely used for the percutaneous application of energy in the subcutaneous space.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.13845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197275/";16/11/2020;Skin laxity;0.9368
389;Medicine in Extreme Environments: A New Medical Student Elective Class for Wilderness, Aerospace, Hyperbaric, Exercise, and Combat Medicine.;10.1016/j.wem.2019.10.006;We developed an elective course titled Medicine in Extreme Environments (MEE) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center for first- and second-year medical students. This course covered physiology, research, clinical practice, and career guidance regarding the fields of wilderness, space, hyperbaric, combat, and exercise medicine. The primary aim was to generate interest in and awareness of these seldom covered fields of medicine by exposing medical students to these disciplines during their preclinical years. A postcourse questionnaire was implemented to investigate whether the MEE course increased awareness of, interest in, and knowledge in the fields of medicine included in the curriculum. Through 2 iterations of the class, a total of 67 students enrolled in the course, and 38 students completed the questionnaire. After course completion, 95% felt they better understood the work and lifestyle of the fields covered, 100% learned more about concepts of each field, and 74% agreed that the elective influenced the direction of their future careers to include some part of the fields emphasized. Although only a limited number of students enrolled in this course, these initial findings suggest that the MEE curriculum may have some utility in promoting awareness of and interest in these medical disciplines among students who attend the course. With continued student and faculty support, this course will likely be continued annually at our institution. We believe that certain aspects of this course may be useful in helping develop similar courses at other medical schools.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wem.2019.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734896/";01/03/2020;Medicine in Extreme Environments;0.9416

To treat the patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), currently no effective drug or vaccine is available. This necessity motivated us to explore potential lead compounds based natural products targeting main protease (Mpro) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. The Mpro enzyme plays a key role in mediating viral replication and transcription and thus being considered as an attractive drug target. Herein, comprehensive computational investigations were performed to identify new lead compounds against main protease enzyme. In this study, the candidate anthocyanin-derived compounds from PubChem database were filtered considering antiviral characteristics of anthocyanins. The structure-based pharmacophore modeling was developed based on the co-crystallized structure of the enzyme with its biological active inhibitor. The generated hypotheses were applied for virtual screening-based PHASE Screen Score. Docking based virtual screening work flow was used to generate hit compounds using HTVS, SP and XP based Glide Gscore. The obtained hit compounds were filtered using ADMET pharmacological and physicochemical properties screening. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the binding affinities of the considered compounds.

391;The Main Sources and Potential Effects of COVID-19-Related Discrimination.;10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_39;"The outbreak of a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which appeared in late 2019 and eventually resulted in the announcement of a pandemic by the World Health Organization, led to global fear and panic as well as the spread of false information and fake news from different sources. As a result, a sharp increase in prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia against different groups of people was observed in different geographical locations. This chapter presents the psychological and social sources of stereotypes and prejudices that take forms in the COVID-19 pandemic. These sources can be located in psychosocial processes, such as (i) socially generated and reinforced fears; (ii) human responses to stress induced by certain types of stimuli; (iii) sense of helplessness based on the lack of control over reality; (iv) psychological responses reinforced by conformism (crowd psychology); and (v) the stigmatization process. The chapter also presents the main groups of increased risk of experiencing prejudice and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic (Asians, health-care workers, COVID-19 patients, and their relatives). Moreover, it provides a documented example of such behaviors. The groups at higher risk of more adverse effects of COVID-19 due to pre-pandemic discrimination are also discussed. Finally, initiatives taken to mitigate the discrimination associated with COVID-19 are presented, as well as the recommendations and good practices for preventing these behaviors during future outbreaks and for limiting discrimination against COVID-19 until the disease can be contained.";"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_39; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973207/";01/01/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9621
392;Combining biomarkers of clot resolution and alveolar basement membrane destruction predicts mortality in the ECLIPSE COPD cohort;10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106185;"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by abnormal epithelial repair resulting in a hypercoagulable state with intra-alveolar accumulation of fibrin and alveolar basement membrane destruction. This study aimed to investigate if the combination of two serological biomarkers evaluating these pathological processes could improve the prediction of mortality risk compared to single biomarkers. METHODS: Matrix metalloproteinase-mediated degradation of the type IV collagen α3 chain (C4Ma3), located in the alveolar basement membrane, and plasmin-mediated degradation of crosslinked fibrin (X-FIB), an end-product of fibrinogen, were assessed serologically in a subset of the ECLIPSE cohort (n = 982). Biomarker data were dichotomized into high versus low at the median. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyze the predictive value of having one or two high biomarkers for all-cause mortality over two years. RESULTS: COPD participants with high levels of two biomarkers were at significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality with a hazard ratio of 7.66 (95% CI 1.75–33.48; p = 0.007) while participants with one high biomarker were not at significantly higher risk (HR 3.79 [95% CI 0.85–16.94]; p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: A combination of serological biomarkers of alveolar basement membrane destruction and clot resolution was predictive of all-cause mortality in COPD.

Herein, 201 patients with CAD and T2DM were enrolled in the Department of Cardiology, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital. DPP4 rs3788979 and rs7608798 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. The general information of all patients was collected, and the associations between DPP4 SNPs and lipid profiles were detected. At the same time, association between SNP polymorphisms and the degree of coronary artery stenosis were analyzed. There was a significant difference in apolipoprotein B (ApoB) levels (P = .011) for the rs3788979 polymorphism, while no difference was identified in other blood lipids or with other mutations. SNP mutation of A to G in rs3788979 was associated with a reduced percentage of severe coronary artery stenosis in female patients (P = .023) as well as those with nosmoking (P = .030), nodrinking (P = 0.007), and nocardiovascular family history (P = 0.015). G allele of rs3788979 is associated with a reduced ApoB level. Besides, we suggest that G allele in rs3788979 may have a cardioprotective effect and prove to be a useful and specific measure when predicting a patient's coronary stenosis severity if diagnosed with CAD and T2DM.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021284/;02/04/2021;Cardiovascular disease;0.9918
394;22G Acquire vs. 20G Procore needle for endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy of pancreatic masses: a randomized study comparing histologic sample quantity and diagnostic accuracy.;10.1055/a-1160-5485;"BACKGROUND : Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) has been suggested for obtaining high quality tissue samples from pancreatic tumors. We performed a multicenter randomized crossover trial comparing EUS-FNB with a 20G Procore needle vs. a 22G Acquire needle. The aims were to compare the quantity of targeted tissue (pancreas) and diagnostic accuracy for the two needles. METHODS : 60 patients admitted for EUS-FNB in three endoscopy units were included. One pass was performed consecutively with each needle, in a randomized order. Histologic material was studied in a blinded manner with respect to the needle. The primary end point was mean cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass. RESULTS : Final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma (n = 46; 77 %), neuroendocrine neoplasm (n = 11; 18 %), autoimmune pancreatitis (n = 2), and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (n = 1). The mean cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass was significantly higher with the 22G Acquire needle at 11.4 mm (95 % confidence interval [CI] 9.0 - 13.8] vs. 5.4 mm (95 %CI 3.8 - 7.0) for the 20G Procore needle (P < 0.001), as was the mean surface area (3.5 mm2 [95 %CI 2.7 - 4.3] vs. 1.8 mm2 [95 %CI 1.2 - 2.3]; P < 0.001). Diagnostic adequacy and accuracy were 100 % and 87 % with the 22G Acquire needle, and 82 % and 67 % with the 20G Procore needle (P = 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS : EUS-guided biopsy of pancreatic masses with the 22G Acquire needle provided more tissue for histologic evaluation and better diagnostic accuracy than the 20G Procore needle.";"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1160-5485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408361/";14/05/2020;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy;0.9086
395;Shock and awe or incentive-compatible harm reduction? Graphic health warnings on tobacco packages;10.1186/s12954-021-00487-3;BACKGROUND: Graphic Health Warnings (GHWs) on cigarette packages were first introduced in Canada in 2001 and will become mandatory in the US as of January 2022. While previous studies have evaluated the impacts of GHWs, the data used in these studies have several shortcomings. The objective of this paper was to investigate the likely impact of such warnings in the US based upon the experience of Canada using hitherto unexplored monthly cigarette sales data, and to explore if alternative approaches involving risk-reduced products might be more successful in reducing smoking. METHODS: We used quasi-experimental segmented regression and difference-in-differences analyses. Data on monthly sales (i.e., shipments) of cigarettes from Canadian manufacturers to Canadian retailers during 1995–2005 were obtained from Statistics Canada. RESULTS: We found that GHWs did not have a significant impact on the sales of cigarettes in Canada. We propose an alternative type of graphical health messaging that actively combines information on how to quit with the legally required messaging. The novelty of the proposal is that it is incentive compatible for the supply side of the market and if adopted in several states, the measure could be tested by using a suitable treatment–control design. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply that we should not expect any notable decline in sales or consumption as a result of implementation of GHWs in the US. The main impact of GHWs will be to add to the anti-smoking culture that has grown steadily over several decades, and this may impact smoking in the longer term.;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00487-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33863348/";16/04/2021;Graphic Health Warnings;0.9047
396;Trend and relationship between environmental accounting disclosure and environmental performance for mining companies listed in China;10.1007/s10668-020-01164-4;We examined the effect of environmental disclosure on environmental performance for listed mining companies in China. Our analysis used China’s Environmental Information Disclosure Degree (EIDD) and the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission’s disclosure guidelines to propose the Environmental Information Disclosure Index. Majority of previous studies on environmental disclosures focused on a particular company or city or province. Few studies considered a whole sector of a country. Among the few studies that considered a whole industry, none of such studies considered the mining industry. In addition, our study employed a recent environmental disclosure index and modified a recent index for environmental performance for the empirical analysis making our study unique. We also employed vigorous reliability and robustness test to ensure that our findings are valid and can be used by policy-makers. Using panel data for thirty-four mining companies from both Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange for the period 2000–2018, our cointegration estimation analysis concluded that corporate environmental performance and environmental information disclosure has a positive and significant relationship at a 1% level. Trend analysis revealed that mining companies comply with environmental information disclosure in China. This was seen from the great improvement in the environmental disclosure for mining companies between 2008 and 2010 after the enforcement of EIDD. Our results contribute to the previous literature and open the way for further studies on industry level in other countries.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424427/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-01164-4";04/01/2021;Environmental Information Disclosure Degree;0.9297
397;False alarms and the positive predictive value of smartphone-based hyperacuity home monitoring for the progression of macular disease: a prospective cohort study;10.1038/s41433-020-01356-2;BACKGROUND: Home monitoring of hyperacuity allows early detection of progression in exudative neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) and diabetic macular oedema (DMO). However, false alarms may pose a significant burden to both patients and healthcare professionals alike. PURPOSE: To assess the false alarm rate and positive predictive value of smartphone-based home monitoring of nvAMD and DMO. METHODS: Patients treated with anti-angiogenic therapy in a pro re nata scheme for nvAMD or DMO at the Medical Retina service (Lucerne, Switzerland) between March and June 2016 were included in this prospective cohort study. The home monitoring test Alleye (Oculocare Ltd, Switzerland) provided a session score from 0–100 in addition to a traffic-light system feedback via the smartphone application. Three consecutive “red” scores were considered as a positive test or alarm signal. Specificity, 1-specificity (false alarm rate) and the predictive value for optical coherence tomography-based disease progression were analysed. RESULTS: 73 eyes of 56 patients performed 2258 tests in 222 “follow-up periods”. Progression was observed in 141 periods (63.5%). The specificity of the test was 93.8% (95% CI: 86.2–98.0%), the false alarm rate 6.1% (95% CI: 2.0–13.8%), and the positive predictive value 80.0% (95% CI: 59.3–93.2%) for the detection of progression. CONCLUSION: False alarm rates for the detection of progression in macular disease via home monitoring is low. These findings suggest that home monitoring may be a useful adjunct for remote management of nvAMD and DMO.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33414531/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-01356-2";07/01/2021;Home monitoring of hyperacuity;0.9497
398;A Study of Blended Learning Using the Smart Class Teaching Module on Psychosocial Dysfunction Course During the Training of Undergraduate Occupational Therapy Students in China;10.12659/msm.931748;BACKGROUND: Online blended learning, also known as “smart classes”, has benefits when compared with traditional teaching methods that use books and lectures. This study aimed to compare the use of the Smart Class teaching module with traditional teaching on the topic of psychosocial dysfunction during the training of undergraduate occupational therapy (OT) students in China. MATERIAL/METHODS: We recruited Grade 2017 OT students as the Smart Class teaching module group and Grade 2016 OT students as the Traditional Class teaching module group to participate in the study. The objective evaluation (assignment score, practical exam score, written exam score, and final score) and subjective evaluation (data from student questionnaires and information from interviews with the lead teacher and assistant teachers) were performed in both groups. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in the final scores (P=0.874) and students’ questionnaire results between the 2 groups. However, data from the student questionnaires and teacher interviews indicated a preference for combining the Smart Class teaching module and the Traditional Class teaching module. CONCLUSIONS: The advantage of the Smart Class teaching module is that it can effectively integrate excellent teaching resources across geographical restrictions and it is conducive to promoting independent learning for students and all-around supervision for teaching. The Smart Class teaching module was comparable to traditional teaching methods for the training of undergraduate OT students in China, but was preferred by the students.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8166649/;26/05/2021;Online blended learning;0.9656
399;Role of OATP4C1 in Renal Handling of Remdesivir and its Nucleoside Analog GS-441524: The First Approved Drug for Patients with COVID-19.;10.18433/jpps31813;"PURPOSE Remdesivir and its active metabolite are predominantly eliminated via renal route; however, information regarding renal uptake transporters is limited. In the present study, the interaction of remdesivir and its nucleoside analog GS-441524 with OATP4C1 was evaluated to provide the detailed information about its renal handling. METHODS We used HK-2 cells, a proximal tubular cell line derived from normal kidney, to confirm the transport of remdesivir and GS-441524. To assess the involvement of OATP4C1 in handling remdesivir and GS-441524, the uptake study of remdesivir and GS-441524 was performed by using OATP4C1-overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells. Moreover, we also evaluated the IC50 and Ki value of remdesivir. RESULTS The time-dependent remdesivir uptake in HK-2 cells was observed. The results of inhibition study using OATs and OCT2 inhibitors and OATP4C1 knockdown suggested the involvement of renal drug transporter OATP4C1. Remdesivir was taken up by OATP4C1/MDCKII cells. OATP4C1-mediated uptake of remdesivir increased linearly up to 10 min and reached a steady state at 30 min. Remdesivir inhibited OATP4C1-mediated transport in a concentration-dependent manner with the IC50 and apparent Ki values of 42 ± 7.8 μM and 37 ± 6.9 μM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We have provided novel information about renal handling of remdesivir. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential drug interaction via OATP4C1 by calculating the Ki value of remdesivir. OATP4C1 may play a pivotal role in remdesivir therapy for COVID-19, particularly in patients with kidney injury.";"https://doi.org/10.18433/jpps31813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34048668/";01/01/2021;remdesivir therapy;0.9245
400;Introducing frequency representation into convolution neural networks for medical image segmentation via twin-Kernel Fourier convolution.;10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106110;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE For medical image segmentation, deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, the powerful spectral representation in the field of image processing is rarely considered in these models. METHODS In this work, we propose to introduce frequency representation into convolution neural networks (CNNs) and design a novel model, tKFC-Net, to combine powerful feature representation in both frequency and spatial domains. Through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation, frequency representation is employed on pooling, upsampling, and convolution without any adjustments to the network architecture. Furthermore, we replace original convolution with twin-Kernel Fourier Convolution (t-KFC), a new designed convolution layer, to specify the convolution kernels for particular functions and extract features from different frequency components. RESULTS We experimentally show that our method has an edge over other models in the task of medical image segmentation. Evaluated on four datasets-skin lesion segmentation (ISIC 2018), retinal blood vessel segmentation (DRIVE), lung segmentation (COVID-19-CT-Seg), and brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2019), the proposed model achieves outstanding results: the metric F1-Score is 0.878 for ISIC 2018, 0.8185 for DRIVE, 0.9830 for COVID-19-CT-Seg, and 0.8457 for BraTS 2019. CONCLUSION The introduction of spectral representation retains spectral features which result in more accurate segmentation. The proposed method is orthogonal to other topology improvement methods and very convenient to be combined.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910149/";14/04/2021;lung segmentation;0.9829
401;Discrimination of COVID-19 from inflammation-induced cytokine storm syndromes by disease-related blood biomarkers.;10.1002/art.41763;OBJECTIVES Infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe illness with high mortality in a subgroup of patients. Such critical course of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is thought to associate with cytokine storm as in macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), although these specific data are still lacking. In this study we aimed to directly address the question, whether immune activation in COVID-19 does indeed mimic conditions as in these classical cytokine storm syndromes. METHODS We quantified levels of 22 biomarkers in serum samples of COVID-19 (n=30, n=83 longitudinal samples in total), sHLH/MAS patients (n=50) as well as healthy controls (n=9) using bead array assay as well as single-marker ELISA and correlated results with disease outcome. RESULTS In sHLH/MAS we observed dramatic activation of the interleukin(IL)-18-interferon (IFN)-γ axis, while increased serum levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and IL-8, as well as strongly reduced levels of soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) in course of SARS-CoV-2 infection discriminate immune dysregulation in critical COVID-19 from the investigated well-recognized cytokine storm conditions. CONCLUSIONS Serum biomarker profiles clearly separate COVID-19 from MAS or sHLH, which questions the significance of systemic hyperinflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the efficacy of drugs targeting key molecules and pathways specifically associated with systemic cytokine storm conditions in the treatment of COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/art.41763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880885/";20/04/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9616
402;Identifying zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between Spike receptor-binding domain and host ACE2;10.1101/2020.09.11.293449;"Despite considerable research progress on SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggested a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation; but more importantly, it proposed a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935105/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.11.293449";11/09/2020;Spike receptor-binding domain;0.9259
403;Autoimmune anti-DNA antibodies predict disease severity in COVID-19 patients;10.1101/2021.01.04.20249054;Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can lead to severe disease and death, however the mechanisms of pathogenesis in these patients remain poorly understood. High levels of autoimmune antibodies have been observed frequently in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients but their specific contribution to disease severity and clinical manifestations remain unknown. We performed a retrospective study of 115 COVID-19 hospitalized patients with different degrees of severity to analyze the generation of autoimmune antibodies to common antigens: a lysate of erythrocytes, the lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) and DNA. The statistical relation of autoantibody levels to death, disease severity and specific pathologies was determined using high-throughput data analysis of 118 clinical parameters for all patients. High levels of IgG autoantibodies against erythrocyte lysates were observed in a large percentage (up to 41%) of patients with COVID-19 compared to uninfected controls. Anti-DNA antibodies determined upon hospital admission were high in 16% of patients and correlated strongly with later development of severe disease, showing a positive predictive value of 89.5% and accounting for 22% of total severe cases. Statistical analysis identified strong correlations between anti-DNA antibodies and markers of cell injury, coagulation, neutrophil levels and erythrocyte size. Anti-DNA autoantibodies may play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and could be developed as a predictive biomarker for disease severity and specific clinical manifestations.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.20249054v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.20249054";04/01/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9935

Freely available open-source algorithms, which have the ability to individualise algorithm parameters paired with commercial insulin pumps, and continuous glucose monitoring make up the so-called ""do it yourself"" (DIY) approach to AID. Limited data on the open-source approach have shown promising results, but data from a large randomised control trial are lacking. METHODS: The CREATE (Community deRivEd AutomaTEd insulin delivery) trial is an open-labelled, randomised, parallel 24-week, multi-site trial comparing sensor augmented pump therapy (SAPT) to our AnyDANA-loop. The three components of AnyDANA-loop are: 1) OpenAPS algorithm implemented in a smartphone (a version of AndroidAPS), 2) DANA-i™ insulin pump and, 3) Dexcom G6(R) continuous glucose monitor (CGM).

405;Decreased duration of intravenous cephalosporins in intensive care unit patients with selective digestive decontamination: a retrospective before-and-after study;10.1007/s10096-020-03966-w;Selective digestive decontamination (SDD) reduces the rate of infection and improves the outcomes of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). A risk associated with its use is the development of multi-drug-resistant organisms. We hypothesized that a 1-day reduction in systemic antimicrobial exposure in the SDD regimen would not affect the outcomes of our patients. In this before-and-after study design, 199 patients and 248 patients were included in a 3-day SDD group and a 2-day SDD group, respectively. The rates of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ICU infections were similar in both groups. The rates of bloodstream infection and bacteriuria were significantly lower in the 2-day SDD group than in the 3-day SDD group. Compared with the patients in the 3-day group, the patients in the 2-day SDD group received fewer antibiotics and less exposure to mechanical ventilation, and they used fewer ICU resources. The rates of ICU mortality and 28-day mortality were similar in both groups. The incidence of multi-drug-resistant organisms was similar in both groups. Within the limitations inherent to our study design, reducing the exposure of prophylactic systemic antibiotics in the SDD setting from 3 days to 2 days was not associated with impaired outcomes. Future randomized controlled trials should be conducted to test this hypothesis and investigate the effects on the development of multi-drug resistant organisms.

406;Prevalence and outcome of contrast-induced nephropathy in major trauma patients;10.1007/s00068-020-01496-w;BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has been well investigated in patients undergoing coronary angiography, but not in trauma patients. The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and to investigate independent risk factors for the development of CIN. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2014, all pre-hospital intubated major trauma patients with documented serum creatinine levels (SCr) undergoing a contrast-enhanced whole-body CT at admission were retrospectively analyzed. CIN was defined as a relative increase in SCr > 25% over the baseline value or an absolute SCr increase of > 44 µmol/l within 72 h. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify significant risk factors. A p value of < 0.01 was considered statistically significant and a p value of 0.01–0.049 suggested evidence. RESULTS: Of 284 analyzed patients, 41 (14%) met the criteria for CIN. There is suggestive evidence that age and lactate level influenced the development of CIN. Six patients (15%) had hemodialysis in the CIN-group and eight (3.3%) in the group without CIN. Complication and mortality rate was higher in patients with CIN (71% vs. 56% and 32% vs. 23%, respectively). CIN was not an independent risk factor for complications or mortality while controlling for age, gender, injury severity score, and lactate level. The length of stay was not affected by CIN. CONCLUSION: CIN occurs frequently in trauma patients, but is not an independent risk factor for complications or mortality. Therefore, contrast enhanced whole-body CT can safely be performed in trauma patients.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500990/;19/09/2020;Contrast-induced nephropathy;0.9511
407;Ranking Tourist Attractions through Online Reviews: A Novel Method with Intuitionistic and Hesitant Fuzzy Information Based on Sentiment Analysis;10.1007/s40815-021-01131-9;Online tourist reviews are the real feeling of tourists after the journey, which have a strong reference value for potential tourists to make travel decisions. However, it is almost impossible for a potential tourist to look through the massive online reviews related to tourist attractions (TAs) so that he/she can make the most appropriate decision. To this end, this paper proposes a recommender system to rank the alternative TAs through online reviews based on aspect-level sentiment analysis and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) with intuitionistic and hesitant fuzzy information. In this methodology, the aspects that the experienced tourists concern are extracted from online reviews to construct a three-level evaluation system (including target layer, criteria layer and sub-criteria layer), which not only ensures the comprehensive evaluation of TAs as much as possible, but also reduces the complexity of the decision-making process. Then, the online reviews related to these sub-criteria are transformed into the corresponding intuitionistic and hesitant fuzzy performance scores through aspect-level sentiment analysis. Furthermore, in order to obtain the final ranking result that more in line with the expectations of the potential tourist, the preference information from the potential tourist and experienced tourists is integrated to determine the weights of criteria. Subsequently, the intuitionistic and hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS (IHF-TOPSIS) method is proposed to rank the alternative TAs. Finally, a case study is provided to verify the validity and applicability of the methodology.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8224999/;24/06/2021;multi-criteria decision-making;0.9748
408;A pilot study of near-field airborne particle concentrations in young children undergoing high flow nasal cannula therapy.;10.1016/j.jhin.2021.04.002;"BACKGROUND High flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) may increase aerosol generation, putting healthcare workers at risk, including from SARS-CoV-2. AIM This study examined whether use of HFNC increases near-field aerosols and if there is a relationship with flow rate. METHODS Subjects aged four weeks to 24 months were recruited. Each child received HFNC therapy at different flow rates. Three stations with particle counters were deployed to measure particle concentrations and dispersion in the room: station one within 0.5 m, station two at 2 m, and station three on the other side of the room. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and relative humidity. Far-field measurements were used to adjust the near-field measurements. FINDINGS We enrolled ten children ranging from 6-23 months (median 9 months). Elevated CO2 indicated the near-field measurements were in the breathing plane. Near-field breathing plane concentrations of aerosols with diameter 0.3 - 10 μm are elevated by the presence of the patient with no HFNC flow, relative to the room far-field, by 0.45 #/cm3. While we observed variability between subjects in their emission and dispersion of particles, we did not find an association between HFNC use, at any flowrate, and near-field particle counts. CONCLUSION This method of particle sampling is feasible in hospital settings; correcting the near-patient aerosol and CO2 levels for the room far-field may provide proxies of exposure risk to pathogens generated. In this pilot, near-patient levels of particles with a diameter between 0.3-10 μm and CO2 were not affected by the use of HFNC.";"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2021.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33864892/";14/04/2021;High flow nasal cannula therapy;0.9244
409;A therapeutic journey of potential drugs against COVID-19.;10.2174/1389557521666210412161157;Coronavirus disease (CoVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) scrambles the world by infecting millions of peoples all over the globe. It has caused tremendous morbidity, mortality and greatly impacted the lives and economy worldwide as an outcome of mandatory quarantines or isolations. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies.

410;Preventing the Spread: A Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Journey to Prevent the Spread of Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) During the 2020 Pandemic;10.1177/10732748211017166;BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) a pandemic. Hospitals around the world began to implement infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to stop further spread and prevent infections within their facilities. Healthcare organizations were challenged to develop response plans, procure personal protective equipment (PPE) that was in limited supply while continuing to provide quality, safe care. METHODS: As a comprehensive cancer center with immunocompromised patients, our efforts began immediately. Preventative measures were established and, as of September 2020, over 14,000 patients have been tested within the facility. From March 2020 through September 2020, only one case of hospital acquired (HA) COVID-19 was identified among our patients. Two cases of suspected community acquired (SCA) cases were also identified. Following the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance, IPC measures were implemented within the facility as information science about the virus developed. This article addresses the IPC measures taken, such as enhancing isolation precautions, implementing screening protocols, disinfecting and reusing N95 respirators, by the center throughout the pandemic as well as the challenges that arouse with a new and emerging infectious disease. CONCLUSIONS: The infection control measures implemented at our comprehensive cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed our center to continue to provide world class cancer care with minimal COVID-19 infection transmission among patients and team members.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/10732748211017166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044598/";28/05/2021;Coronavirus Disease;0.9872
411;Myoclonus and Cerebellar Ataxia Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Case Report and Review of the Literature.;10.12890/2021_002531;The current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global health crisis. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic infection to critical illness affecting almost every organ including the central and peripheral nervous systems. Myoclonus, a less expected and relatively unusual neurological complication, together with ataxia, has lately been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We describe the case of a 67-year-old male patient, admitted to our hospital for interstitial bilateral pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, who progressively developed general myoclonus and later cerebellar ataxia and gait disturbance. Given the timeline from COVID-19 systemic symptoms to neurological manifestations and the normal results of extensive and non-conclusive diagnostic work-up (blood test, lumbar puncture, EEG, cerebral MRI), a para-infectious encephalopathy related to SARS-CoV-2 was contemplated and a high dose of methylprednisolone was started with prompt symptom improvement. Further investigation and neuroepidemiological studies are needed to help define the mechanism of neuroinvasion and the entire spectrum of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in mildly affected patients, in terms of prevention, treatment and possible neurological sequelae. LEARNING POINTS SARS-CoV-2 infection can be related to neurological symptoms and sequelae.Myoclonus, specifically when associated with ataxia, might represent the expression of COVID-19-related encephalopathy.Myoclonus associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly responds to treatment with steroids.;"https://doi.org/10.12890/2021_002531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34123943/";01/01/2021;encephalopathy;0.9468
412;The relationship between cytokine and neutrophil gene network distinguishes SARS-CoV-2-infected patients by sex and age.;10.1172/jci.insight.147535;The fact that the COVID-19 fatality rate varies by sex and age is poorly understood. Notably, the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections mostly depends on the control of cytokine storm and the increasingly recognized pathological role of uncontrolled neutrophil activation. Here, we used an integrative approach with publicly available RNA-Seq data sets of nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with SARS-CoV-2, according to sex and age. Female and young patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a larger number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared with male and elderly patients, indicating a stronger immune modulation. Among them, we found an association between upregulated cytokine/chemokine- and downregulated neutrophil-related DEGs. This was correlated with a closer relationship between female and young subjects, while the relationship between male and elderly patients was closer still. The association between these cytokine/chemokines and neutrophil DEGs is marked by a strongly correlated interferome network. Here, female patients exhibited reduced transcriptional levels of key proinflammatory/neutrophil-related genes, such as CXCL8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2), IL-1β, S100A9, ITGAM, and DBNL, compared with male patients. These genes are well known to be protective against inflammatory damage. Therefore, our work suggests specific immune-regulatory pathways associated with sex and age of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and provides a possible association between inverse modulation of cytokine/chemokine and neutrophil transcriptional signatures.;"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.147535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027897/";24/05/2021;interferome network;0.9231
413;New Insights in Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia: From Pathogenesis to Therapy;10.3390/jcm9123859;Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a highly heterogeneous disease due to increased destruction of autologous erythrocytes by autoantibodies with or without complement involvement. Other pathogenic mechanisms include hyper-activation of cellular immune effectors, cytokine dysregulation, and ineffective marrow compensation. AIHAs may be primary or associated with lymphoproliferative and autoimmune diseases, infections, immunodeficiencies, solid tumors, transplants, and drugs. The direct antiglobulin test is the cornerstone of diagnosis, allowing the distinction into warm forms (wAIHA), cold agglutinin disease (CAD), and other more rare forms. The immunologic mechanisms responsible for erythrocyte destruction in the various AIHAs are different and therefore therapy is quite dissimilar. In wAIHA, steroids represent first line therapy, followed by rituximab and splenectomy. Conventional immunosuppressive drugs (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine) are now considered the third line. In CAD, steroids are useful only at high/unacceptable doses and splenectomy is uneffective. Rituximab is advised in first line therapy, followed by rituximab plus bendamustine and bortezomib. Several new drugs are under development including B-cell directed therapies (ibrutinib, venetoclax, parsaclisib) and inhibitors of complement (sutimlimab, pegcetacoplan), spleen tyrosine kinases (fostamatinib), or neonatal Fc receptor. Here, a comprehensive review of the main clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and pathogenic mechanisms of AIHA are provided, along with classic and new therapeutic approaches.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9123859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33261023/";27/11/2020;cold agglutinin disease;0.9886
414;Decreased CO(2) Levels as Indicators of Possible Mechanical Ventilation-Induced Hyperventilation in COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Analysis;10.3389/fpubh.2020.596168;Background: Six months since the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the pandemic continues to grow worldwide, although the outbreak in Wuhan, the worst-hit area, has been controlled. Thus, based on the clinical experience in Wuhan, we hypothesized that there is a relationship between the patient's CO(2) levels and prognosis. Methods: COVID-19 patients' information was retrospectively collected from medical records at the Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were conducted to determine the correlation between decreased CO(2) levels and disease severity or mortality risk. The Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was coupled with the log-rank test to understand COVID-19 progression in patients with decreased CO(2) levels. Curve fitting was used to confirm the correlation between computed tomography scores and CO(2) levels. Results: Cox regression analysis showed that the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients correlated with decreased CO(2) levels. The adjusted hazard ratios for decreased CO(2) levels in COVID-19 patients were 8.710 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.773–27.365, P < 0.001], and 4.754 (95% CI: 1.380–16.370, P = 0.013). The adjusted odds ratio was 0.950 (95% CI: 0.431–2.094, P = 0.900). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that patients with decreased CO(2) levels had a higher risk of mortality. Conclusions: Decreased CO(2) levels increased the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients, which might be caused by hyperventilation during mechanical ventilation. This finding provides important insights for clinical treatment recommendations.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33585382/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.596168";08/01/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9572
415;Potential effects of vaccinations on the prevention of COVID-19: rationale, clinical evidence, risks and public health considerations.;10.1080/14760584.2020.1825951;INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly spread around the world. AREAS COVERED This review will discuss the available immunologic and clinical evidence to support the benefit of the influenza, pneumococcal and tuberculosis vaccines in the prevention of COVID-19 and in the prognosis improvement of COVID-19 patients as well as to provide an updated overview on the COVID-19-specific vaccines that are in the development pipeline. In addition, implications for vaccination strategies from a public health perspective will be discussed. EXPERT OPINION Some commonly used vaccines are being considered for their potentially beneficial role in preventing or improving the prognosis of COVID-19: influenza, pneumococcal and tuberculosis vaccines. These vaccines may have either direct effect on COVID-19 via different types of immune responses or indirect effects by reducing the burden of viral and bacterial respiratory diseases on individual patients and national healthcare system and by facilitating differential diagnoses with other viral/bacterial respiratory disease. The latter may ultimately allow a more rapid SARS-CoV-2 infected patient isolation and contact tracing. On the other hand, a large number of candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are currently in the pipeline and undergoing phase I, II and III clinical studies. As SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are expected to be marketed through accelerated regulatory pathways, vaccinovigilance as well as planning of a successful vaccination campaign will play a major role.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2020.1825951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940090/";17/09/2020;INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease;0.9725
416;Governance in health workforce: how do we improve on the concept? A network-based, stakeholder-driven approach;10.1186/s12960-020-00545-0;BACKGROUND: Health workforce governance has been proposed as key to improving health services delivery, yet few studies have examined the conceptualisation of health workforce governance in detail and exploration in literature remains limited. METHODS: A literature review using PubMed, Google Scholar and grey literature search was conducted to map out the current conceptualisation of health workforce governance. We identified all published literature relating to governance in health workforce since 2000 and analysed them on two fronts: the broad definition of governance, and the operationalisation of broad definition into key dimensions of governance. RESULTS: Existing literature adopts governance concepts established in health literature and does not adapt understanding to the health workforce context. Definitions are largely quoted from health literature whilst dimensions are focused around the sub-functions of governance which emphasise operationalising governance practices over further conceptualisation. Two sub-functions are identified as essential to the governance process: stakeholder participation and strategic direction. CONCLUSIONS: Although governance in health systems has gained increasing attention, governance in health workforce remains poorly conceptualised in literature. We propose an improved conceptualisation in the form of a stakeholder-driven network governance model with the national government as a strong steward against vested stakeholder interests. Further research is needed to explore and develop on the conceptual thinking behind health workforce governance.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33388068/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-020-00545-0";02/01/2021;Health workforce governance;0.9566
417;Development and pre-clinical characterization of two therapeutic equine formulations towards SARS-CoV-2 proteins for the potential treatment of COVID-19;10.1101/2020.10.17.343863;In the current global emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, passive immunotherapy emerges as a promising treatment for COVID-19. Among animal-derived products, equine formulations are still the cornerstone therapy for treating envenomations due to animal bites and stings. Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix) viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content, final products exhibited high in vitro neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80 times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials. The technological strategy we describe here can be adapted by other producers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343863;19/10/2020;passive immunotherapy;0.9696
418;Repair of complete atrioventricular canal defects: Early and midterm results and comparison of the left anterior leaflet augmentation technique with traditional technics.;10.1111/jocs.15602;"BACKGROUND Complete atrioventricular septal defects (CAVSD) include a variable spectrum of congenital malformations with different forms of clinical findings. We examined early and midterm outcomes, the need for reoperation, postoperative residual AV valve regurgitation, and other risk factors after various CAVSD repairs. METHODS Between 2014 and 2018, we have performed 89 isolated CAVSD repairs. We retrospectively reviewed the patients' medical records. Patients were divided into three groups according to their repair techniques modified one patch repair (MP) (n = 16); two patch repair (TP) (n = 49); and left anterior leaflet augmentation (ALA) technique (n = 24). RESULTS Eighty patients (89.8%) survived hospital discharge. Early mortality rates were three (18.8%) in the group MP, five (10.2%) in the group TP, and one (4.2%) in the group ALA. Thirteen patients died during the follow-up period. Late mortality rates were three (18.8%) in the group MP, four (16.6%) in the group ALA, and six (12.2%) in the group TP. The mean follow-up time was 35.9 ± 22.97 months (range: 0.3-77 months). The morbidity and mortality results were similar between-group TP and ALA but worse in the MP group. Low body weight (<4 kg) and younger age at surgery (<4 months) were found to be risk factors on mortality by univariate and multivariate analysis. Surgical technic was not found to be an independent risk factor. CONCLUSION In our series, TP and ALA techniques had satisfactory results in early and midterm periods. Younger age and small bodyweight might increase early mortality and the need for reoperation.";"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.15602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955056/";05/05/2021;Complete atrioventricular septal defects;0.915
419;Risk conditions in healthcare workers of a pediatric coronavirus disease center in Mexico City.;10.24875/bmhim.20000355;BACKGROUND The new evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by its high capacity to transmit. Health-care personnel is highly susceptible to becoming infected. This study aimed to determine the characteristics and known risk factors for contagion and severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 disease in health-care personnel of a pediatric coronavirus disease (COVID) center in Mexico City. METHODS In the last week of March 2020 (at the beginning of phase 2 of the Ministry of Health's national campaign in Mexico), a study was conducted on healthcare workers of a pediatric COVID hospital in Mexico City. Using a virtual interview, we evaluated comorbidities, mobility, areas and functions where they carry out the activities, protection measures, contact history, and vaccination. According to their activities, healthcare workers were classified into the following areas: medical, nursing, other health-care personnel (researchers, nutritionists, rehabilitation, imaging, and laboratory), administrative, and other services. We compared the variables between the groups of healthcare workers with the X2 test. RESULTS We included 812 participants. The mean age was 41 ± 11 years, and 33% were overweight or obese, 18% were over 60 years old, and 19% had high blood pressure. Medical and nursing personnel presented a higher proportion in the use of standard protection measures. CONCLUSIONS Among healthcare workers, there are risk conditions for the development of complications in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most medical and nursing personnel use standard protective measures.;"https://doi.org/10.24875/bmhim.20000355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465059/";19/01/2021;pediatric coronavirus disease;0.9532
420;A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Mental Illness Symptoms in Spain in the COVID-19 Crisis;10.1101/2021.04.11.21255274;Objective: This paper systematically reviews and assesses the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms in the general population, frontline healthcare workers (HCWs), and adult students in Spain during the COVID-19 crisis. Data sources: Articles in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and medRxiv from March 2020 to February 6, 2021. Results: The pooled prevalence of anxiety symptoms in 23 studies comprising a total sample of 85,560 was 20% (95% CI: 15% - 25%, I2 = 99.9%), that of depression symptoms in 23 articles with a total sample comprising of 86,469 individuals was 23% (95% CI: 18% - 28%, I2 = 99.8%), and that of insomnia symptoms in 4 articles with a total sample of 915 were 52% (95% CI: 42-64%, I2 = 88.9%). The overall prevalence of mental illness symptoms in frontline HCWs, general population, and students in Spain are 42%, 19%, and 50%, respectively. Discussion: The accumulative evidence from the meta-analysis reveals that adults in Spain suffered higher prevalence rates of mental illness symptoms during the COVID-19 crisis with a significantly higher rate relative to other countries such as China. Our synthesis reveals high heterogeneity, varying prevalence rates and a relative lack of studies in frontline and general HCWs in Spain, calling future research and interventions to pay attention to those gaps to help inform evidence-based mental health policymaking and practice in Spain during the continuing COVID-19 crisis. The high prevalence rates call for preventative and prioritization measures of the mental illness symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.11.21255274; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.11.21255274v1?rss=1";14/04/2021;frontline healthcare workers;0.9233
421;COVID-19 in Smokeless Tobacco Habitués: Increased Susceptibility and Transmission;10.7759/cureus.8824;As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic continues to sweep across the globe, the world is responding by implementing public awareness campaigns, social distancing measures, and other preventive strategies to arrest the spread of this lethal disease. Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exacts a heavy toll on patients with existing comorbidities. Smokeless tobacco (SLT) consumption is of particular concern in countries in South Asia with high population densities, as it facilitates exposure to SARS-CoV-2 within or between communities by the act of public spitting. Salivary droplets generated in this act are a potential threat because they can transmit this airborne infection. Moreover, large gatherings at tobacco retail outlets, frequent hand-to-mouth contact, and sharing of apparatus by SLT habitués could also aid in increasing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. SLT-induced higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors along with the presence of furin in the oral mucosa and dysfunctional immune responses among SLT habitués increase viral dissemination and an individual’s susceptibility to COVID-19. Issuing rigorous regulations to restrict the use of various forms of SLT products and the obnoxious act of spitting in public can assist in arresting the spread of COVID-19. Widespread education campaigns enlightening the community regarding the adverse effects of SLT consumption and its relationship with COVID-19, along with providing effective assistance to quit for those who are addicted, would decrease the spread of COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742838/";25/06/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9544
422;Retrieval of lost patients in the system for hepatitis C microelimination: a single-center retrospective study;10.1186/s12876-021-01792-8;BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Most of the infected people have no clinical symptoms. The current strategy for HCV elimination includes test and treatment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the campaign for retrieving patients who were lost to follow-up, for subsequent re-evaluation. METHODS: From January 2020 to October 2020, patients who had prior tests for positive anti-HCV antibody in 2010–2018 in our hospital were enrolled for our patient callback campaign. Patients who had unknown HCV RNA status or no documented successful antiviral therapy history were selected for anti-HCV therapy re-evaluation. To facilitate patient referral in the hospital, we developed an electronic reminding system and called the candidate patients via telephone during the study period. RESULTS: Through the hospital electronic system, 3783 patients with positive anti-HCV antibody documentation were identified. Among them, 1446 (38.22%) had tested negative for HCV RNA or had anti-HCV therapy, thereby excluded. Of the 2337 eligible patients, 1472 (62.99%) were successfully contacted and called back during the study period for subsequent HCV RNA testing and therapy. We found that 42.19% of the patients had positive HCV RNA and 88% received subsequent anti-HCV therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients with positive HCV serology were lost for HCV confirmatory test or therapy in the hospital. Therefore, this targeted HCV callback approach in the hospital is feasible and effective in achieving microelimination.;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12876-021-01792-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33964873/";08/05/2021;Hepatitis C virus;0.9389

In COVID-19, the relationship of many laboratory parameters to morbidity and mortality has been defined. In our study, we aimed to determine the relationship of serum vitamin D level to clinical course and prognosis. Materials and Methods This study included 108 patients; 88 patients who stayed in Ataturk University and Erzurum City Hospital between March 24, 2020 and May 15, 2020, who were identified as COVID-19 by real-time PCR method from the nasopharyngeal swab and 20 asymptomatic voluntary medical personnel who tested negative for real-time PCR after routine check-up in our hospital. Result In statistical analysis conducted between healthy control group and vitamin D levels of patients admitted due to COVID-19, it was observed that patients infected with COVID-19 had a lower level (p= 0.004). In 20 patients developing MAS, a lower level of vitamin D was observed (p= 0.004) compared to 68 patients who did not develop. In the comparison of vitamin D levels of the patients (n= 8) who developed exitus in their follow up due to COVID-19, it was observed that vitamin D levels were statistically significantly lower compared to the living (p= 0.009). Conclusions Due to COVID-19, pandemic, long-running quarantines caused insufficient use of sunlight and worsening of vitamin D deficiency.

425;Efficacy of a Low-Dose Diosmin Therapy on Improving Symptoms and Quality of Life in Patients with Chronic Venous Disease: Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial;10.3390/nu13030999;Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is a common medical condition affecting up to 80% of the general population. Clinical manifestations can range from mild to more severe signs and symptoms that contribute to the impairment of the quality of life (QoL) of affected patients. Among treatment options, venoactive drugs such as diosmin are widely used in the symptomatic treatment in all clinical stages. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a new formulated diosmin in relieving symptoms and improving QoL in patients suffering from CVD. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study, CVD patients with a Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification system between C2 and C4 were randomized to receive a bioavailable diosmin (as μsmin(®) Plus) 450 mg tablet once daily or a placebo for 8 weeks. Clinical symptoms and QoL were monitored using the measurement of leg circumference, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, Global Index Score (GIS) and Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). A total of 72 subjects completed the study. From week 4, leg edema was significantly decreased in the active group (p < 0.001). An improvement in the VAS score was observed in the active group compared to placebo at the end of treatment (p < 0.05). GIS and VCSS scores were significantly improved in the active group at week 8 (p < 0.001). No treatment related-side effects were recorded. The results of this study showed that the administration of low-dose μsmin(®) Plus was safe and effective in relieving symptoms and improving QoL in subjects with CVD.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808784/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13030999";19/03/2021;Clinical Severity Score;0.9863
426;RSI model: COVID-19 in Germany Alternating quarantine episodes and normal episodes;10.1101/2020.05.01.20075754;Pandemic containment is essential to prevent overloading of the medical care system. Limitation of the pandemic is mainly facilitated by reducing infections. An effective strategy is social distancing. However, this strategy draws more and more criticism, in Germany as elsewhere, because of its economic and psychological consequences for society. How can the number of infected person be held below the medical care capacity while restrictions affecting the general public are minimized? Various approaches exist to retarding the infection rate during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak until vaccine has been developed, without overloading medical capacity. Options being discussed include large-scale testing, contact tracing and social distancing. A study published by the Imperial College contains a model calculation of the effects of alternating school closings and openings in the United States and the United Kingdom. However, no satisfactory solution was developed. Variables which describe the medical care resources in Germany and the age and occupational structure of its population contrast sharply with American and British conditions. This study attempts to apply the Imperial College approach of alternating quarantine and normal episodes for the entire population. Mathematically, an oscillation in hospitalization can be imposed. The difficulty lies in determining the non-controllable parameters related to the virus. Varying the ambiguously quantified input variables is investigated in an attempt to devise a strategy for all combinations that does not overload the clinical system.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.20075754; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.20075754v1?rss=1";05/05/2020;coronavirus;0.9907
427;An evaluation of the environmental impact assessment practice in Uganda: challenges and opportunities for achieving sustainable development;10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04758;Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a broad process that emerged from the National Environment Policy Act, 1970 in the U.S. Its primary objective is to generate information on the likely impacts of a project on all aspects of the environment and used in agency decision making and in the long run protect the environment and achieve sustainable development. EIA practice in Uganda was formally established through the National Environment Act, 1995 and now in practice for over 25 years. However, there is increasing level of water pollution especially Lake Victoria, rivers, streams, aquifers and soils. This research reviewed the institutional, legal and regulatory framework for EIA, related literature and EIA documents especially EIA reports and conducted key EIA stakeholders survey using questionnaires to identify capacity and practice issues. The results revealed that, there was gap between law and practice arising from inadequate and ineffective public participation, weak follow-up, low key stakeholder's capacity, political interference, lack of SEA practice and not embracing EIA in a transboundary context. However, there is fairly good and comprehensive institutional, legislative and regulatory framework for EIA, good local governance structures, adequate staffing, robust national planning framework, active non-state actors and regional groupings. In order to maximize the potential of EIA as a means for achieving the SDGs, we recommended measures to address the challenges facing the EIA practice as well as utilize the existing opportunities within the context in which EIA is applied.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020316017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020316017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32984571/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04758";21/09/2020;Environmental Impact Assessment;0.9166
428;Self-rated smell ability enables highly specific predictors of COVID-19 status: a case control study in Israel;10.1093/ofid/ofaa589;BACKGROUND: Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential for detection and prevention of COVID-19. Sudden onset of taste and smell loss is a hallmark of COVID-19, and optimal ways for including these symptoms in the screening of patients and distinguishing COVID-19 from other acute viral diseases, should be established. METHODS: We performed a case-control study on patients that were PCR-tested for COVID-19 (112 positive and 112 negative participants), recruited during the first wave (March 2020 – May 2020) of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. Patients reported over by phone their symptoms and medical history and rated their olfactory and gustatory abilities before and during their illness on a 1-10 scale. RESULTS: Changes in smell and taste occurred in 68% (95% CI 60%-76%) and 72% (64%-80%), of positive patients, with 24 (11-53 range) and 12 (6-23) respective odds ratios. The ability to smell was decreased by 0.5±1.5 in negatives, and by 4.5±3.6 in positives. A penalized logistic regression classifier based on 5 symptoms has 66% sensitivity, 97% specificity and an area under the ROC curve of 0.83 (AUC) on a hold-out set. A classifier based on degree of smell change only is almost as good, with 66% sensitivity, 97% specificity and 0.81 AUC. The predictive positive value (PPV) of this classifier is 0.68 and negative predictive value (NPV) is 0.97. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported quantitative olfactory changes, either alone or combined with other symptoms, provide a specific tool for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.

429;Pediatric Crohn's Disease and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and COVID-19 Treated with Infliximab;10.1097/mpg.0000000000002809;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to a severe inflammatory response referred to as a cytokine storm. We describe a case of severe COVID-19 infection in a recently diagnosed pediatric Crohn's disease patient successfully treated with Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) blockade. The patient presented with five days of fever, an erythematous maculopapular facial rash, and abdominal pain without respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive. Despite inpatient treatment for COVID-19 and a perianal abscess, the patient acutely decompensated, with worsening fever, tachycardia, fluid-refractory hypotension, elevation of liver enzymes, and transformation of the rash into purpura extending from the face to the trunk, upper and lower extremities, including the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet. Cytokine profile revealed rising levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, higher than those described in either inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or severe COVID-19 alone. The patient was treated with infliximab for TNF-α blockade to address both moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) temporally related to COVID-19. Within hours of infliximab treatment, fever, tachycardia and hypotension resolved. Cytokine profile improved with normalization of TNF-α, a decrease in IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations. This case supports a role for blockade of TNF-α in the treatment of COVID-19 inflammatory cascade. The role of anti-TNF agents in patients with MIS-C temporally related to COVID-19 requires further investigation.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000002809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32452979/";21/05/2020;bowel disease;0.9554
430;Collaboration between GI surgery & Gastroenterology improves understanding of the optimal antireflux valve-the omega flap valve.;10.1007/s00464-021-08416-y;BACKGROUND Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic and sometimes disabling disease. An important component in the surgical management of GERD is either laparoscopic or endoscopic restoration of the native gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV). Recently, a procedure combining laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair with transoral incisionless fundoplication (cTIF) was introduced. This relatively new operation is performed in collaboration between the gastrointestinal (GI) surgeon and the gastroenterologist. METHODS By working together, both interventionalists gain new insight into the ideal GEFV by observing the same operation being performed from different perspectives. In the cTIF, the gastroenterologist learns from an external perspective, through the laparoscopic view, the importance of the crura in contributing to the antireflux barrier. Similarly, the GI surgeon gains understanding of the elements that define an effective and desirable GEFV through an endoscopic perspective. RESULTS This collaboration with cTIF and seeing the procedure from different perspectives have led to our improved understanding of 1) factors contributing to an optimal surgically constructed GEFV and 2) the limitations of the GEFV constructed by the conventional laparoscopic total and partial fundoplications. CONCLUSION The collaboration between GI surgery and gastroenterology with cTIF has led to an improved understanding in characteristics of an optimal antireflux barrier and allowed for a proposed technical modification of the current fundoplication technique to optimize the construct of the surgical GEFV.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08416-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709228/";11/03/2021;Gastroesophageal reflux disease;0.9302
431;The symbiotic relationship between educational robotics and computer science in formal education;10.1007/s10639-021-10494-3;Educational Robotics (ER) has the potential to provide significant benefits to education, provided an increase in outreach by transitioning from the extra-curricular initiatives in which ER has thrived to formal education. As Computer Science (CS) Education is undergoing curricular reforms worldwide, the present study addresses the case of a Digital Education reform that included ER as a means to teach core CS concepts. Approximately 350 teachers from the first four grades of primary school participated in a mandatory two-year continuing professional development (CPD) program. The first year of the program was dedicated to CS and introduced teachers to CS Unplugged (CSU) and Robotics Unplugged (RU) activities. As such, we analyse the interplay between these activities and focus on teachers’ voluntary adoption of the proposed content in classrooms. This is complemented by an analysis of their perception and recommendation of ER. The findings highlight three main points. Firstly, ER benefits from the integration in the CS CPD, as this provides the necessary traction to introduce ER into teacher practices (the teachers freely devoted 2275 h to ER activities in their classrooms, over two years). Secondly, the presence of ER activities in the CS-CPD allows a higher proportion of teachers to adopt the CS content, as there are teachers that favour one type of activity over the other. Finally, the globally positive perception of ER registered in this study is relevant for two reasons: teachers were not voluntarily participating in the CPD, and results did not differ between pioneers and novices.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10494-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841027/";04/04/2021;continuing professional development;0.9017

433;Equity factors during the COVID-19 pandemic: Difficulties in emergency remote teaching (ert) through online learning;10.1007/s10639-021-10632-x;Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Emergency Remote Teaching through Online Learning (ERT-OL) has become the prevalent form of learning at many universities worldwide. At the same time, voices around the world have pointed to difficulties in online learning in general and to concerns regarding educational equity in particular. The current study sought to increase knowledge about specific hindering elements in ERT-OL and about the relationships between these elements from the standpoint of the following equity factors—socioeconomic status, language, and juggling among students who are also parents or working. To this end, the study analyzed 154 open-ended textual statements concerning the difficulties perceived by students at a university in Israel. The qualitative thematic analysis generated a map of hindering elements categorized in terms of a) processes: technology, pedagogy, content, situation and individual characteristics, and b) outcomes: cognitive, affective, social, and physical. The map revealed a mesh of intricate mediating and moderating links whose effect can intensify for each equity factor. On the positive side, seeds of mitigating strategies emerged as well. The study advances knowledge regarding ERT-OL hindering elements and their relationships and provides a better understanding of how these debilitating relationships may be exacerbated when equity factors are considered. Researchers and teachers interested in ERT-OL or in “normal” online learning in the future can use the map as a research and teaching framework to identify inequities and prevent further gaps.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239124/;29/06/2021;Emergency Remote Teaching through Online Learning;0.9247

The present study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic potential of phenotypic methods for carbapenemase [carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamases (CHDLs) and metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs)] production, by comparing with molecular detection of genes. Methods One hundred and fifty clinical CRAB isolates collected between August 2013 and January 2014 were studied. Multiplex PCR was performed to identify the carbapenemases produced (class D blaOXA-51, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-58; class B blaVIM, blaNDM-1, blaIMP; class A blaKPC). Each isolate was evaluated for carbapenemase production by studying the pattern of imipenem hydrolysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Results The most commonly encountered carbapenemase genes were blaOXA-51(100%), blaOXA-23(98%), blaVIM(49.3%), blaNDM-1(18.7%) and blaOXA-58(2%). MALDI-TOF MS was able to detect 30.6 per cent carbapenemases within three hours (P=0.001 for MBL and P>0.05 for CHDL) and 65.3 per cent within six hours (P=0.001 for MBL and P>0.05 for CHDL). Interpretation & conclusions MALDI-TOF MS reliably detected carbapenemase activity within a short span of time, thus helping in tailoring patient therapy.

435;Abnormal Splanchnic Regional Saturations in a Preterm Infant That Developed Necrotizing Enterocolitis Following a Red Blood Cell Transfusion.;10.1097/anc.0000000000000711;BACKGROUND Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been associated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm infants. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to noninvasively monitor regional oxygen saturations (rSO2). CLINICAL FINDINGS This former 28-week female premature infant, 29 days old, received an RBC transfusion due to increased apneic spells and a hematocrit of 27%. Within 24 hours she developed abdominal distension and passed a bloody stool (Bell's stage 2 NEC on abdominal x-ray). She completed 7 days of antibiotics and nothing-by-mouth status and was discharged home on room air and oral feedings on day of life 70. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS We describe the presentation of NEC following a RBC transfusion in a preterm infant monitored with cerebral and splanchnic NIRS. INTERVENTIONS Mean rSO2 (cerebral and splanchnic) measurements were continuously recorded and calculated in 30-minute periods at baseline (prior to packed RBC transfusion), every hour during the RBC transfusion, and every 3 hours for the following 48 hours. OUTCOMES In this infant, average baseline splanchnic rSO2 was low at 46.5%, and increased during transfusion to 65%. However, following the RBC transfusion and an enteral feeding, splanchnic rSO2 dramatically decreased to 26%, and remained low until the time of NEC diagnosis. PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS To develop awareness of the increased risk for NEC in premature infants with significant anemia that receive packed RBC transfusions. With further studies and education, NIRS could be a valuable tool for the nurses and medical team to identify these at-risk neonates.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/anc.0000000000000711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32868590/";01/10/2020;Necrotizing enterocolitis;0.9461

The current study was conducted to assess the socio-behavioural impact of COVID-19 among the general population across India between the first and the second wave of pandemic. METHODS A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 15th March -25th March 2021 using a pre-validated validated questionnaire upon the general population using e-survey, telephonic and face-to-face interview. The participants were recruited from the different regions of India by the purposive and snowball sampling technique following the principle of maximum diversity. Appropriate statistical tests were applied to study the association between the various sociodemographic variables and different behaviours. RESULTS A total of 1079 responses were analysed for the study. Almost half of the participants feared contracting the COVID-19 infection. Overall, female participants, elderly people (more than 60 years of age) and urban dwellers reported a greater fear in the survey. More than half of the participants (53.39%) reported significant difficulties due to home confinement. People have become more inclined to adopt healthy lifestyles. There are mixed responses in the area of following preventive practices.

437;Evaluation of a novel 5 day accelerated 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol in major depression;10.1101/2020.09.12.20193383;BACKGROUND Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective intervention in major depressive disorder (MDD) but requires daily travel to a treatment clinic over several weeks. Shorter rTMS courses retaining similar effectiveness would thus increase the practicality and scalability of the technique, and therefore its accessibility. OBJECTIVE We assessed the feasibility of a novel 5 day accelerated 1 Hz rTMS protocol. We hypothesized that this novel rTMS protocol would be safe and well-tolerated while shortening the overall treatment course. METHODS We conducted a prospective, single-arm, open-label feasibility study. Thirty (30) participants received a one-week (5 days) accelerated (8 sessions per day, 40 sessions total) course of 1 Hz rTMS (600 pulses per session, 50-minute intersession interval) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R-DLPFC) using a figure-of-eight coil at 120% of the resting motor threshold (rMT). Depression severity was assessed on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17). RESULTS Response and remission rates 1 week after treatment were 33.3% and 13.3% respectively and increased to 43.3% and 30.0% at 4 weeks after treatment. No serious adverse events occurred. All participants reported manageable pain levels. CONCLUSION 1 Hz rTMS administered 8 times daily for 5 days is safe and well-tolerated. Efficacy at the end of the course was similar to a standard daily course of 1 Hz rTMS, and there appears to be an additional delayed effect. Further validation in a randomized trial is required.;http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.20193383v1?rss=1;16/09/2020;Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression;0.9611
438;A preliminary assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on environment – A case study of China;10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138915;Abstract The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is seriously threatening world public health security. Currently, >200 countries and regions have been affected by the epidemic, with the number of infections and deaths still increasing. As an extreme event, the outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly damaged the global economic growth and caused a certain impact on the environment. This paper takes China as a case study, comprehensively evaluating the dynamic impact of COVID-19 on the environment. The analysis results indicate that the outbreak of COVID-19 improves China's air quality in the short term and significantly contributes to global carbon emission reduction. However, in the long run, there is no evidence that this improvement will continue. When China completely lifts the lockdown and resumes large-scale industrial production, its energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are likely to exceed the level before the event. Moreover, COVID-19 significantly reduces the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the atmosphere. The decline initially occurred near Wuhan and eventually spread to the whole country. The above phenomenon shows that the decreasing economic activities and traffic restrictions directly lead to the changes of China's energy consumption and further prevent the environment from pollution. The results in this study support the fact that strict quarantine measures can not only protect the public from COVID-19, but also exert a positive impact on the environment. These findings can provide a reference for other countries to assess the influence of COVID-19 on the environment.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720324323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348946/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720324323; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138915";01/08/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9406

The present study was designed to explore which of a series of psychosocial predictors of addictive behaviors could differentiate problematic Internet use (PIU) and Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) in a sample of University students. A total of 144 participants (76 males, mean age = 23.03 years ± 2.83) were separated into three groups: those presenting with PIU (18 females, Mean age = 22.27 years), those presenting with CUD (22 female, Mean age = 22.73 years), and a control group (28 female, Mean age = 24.04 years). Participants completed the Internet Abusive Use Questionnaire (IAUQ), the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11), the Multidimensional Distress Tolerance Scale (MDTS), the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), the Metacognitions Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30), and the Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire-10 (RTQ-10). The classification analysis results showed that 68.8% of the control group, 70.8% of the PIU group, and 81.3% of the CUD group were correctly classified in their respective groups. In addition, the results of the discriminant function analysis showed that there was a significant difference between members of the PIU and CUD groups in the degree of family support (0.45), significant other (0.33), tolerance of physical discomfort (0.30), reappraisal (0.42), and cognitive confidence (0.35).

440;Lombardy, Northern Italy: COVID-19 second wave less severe and deadly than the first? A preliminary investigation.;10.1080/23744235.2021.1884745;BACKGROUND The much-heralded second wave of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has arrived in Italy. Right now, one of the main questions about COVID-19 is whether the second wave is less severe and deadly than the first wave. In order to answer this challenging question, we decided to evaluate the chest X-ray (CXR) severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the mechanical ventilation (MV) use, the patient outcome, and certain clinical/laboratory data during the second wave and compare them with those of the first wave. METHODS During the two COVID-19 waves two independent groups of hospitalised patients were selected. The first group consisted of the first 100 COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital during the first wave. The second group consisted of another 100 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital during the second wave. We enlisted only Caucasian male patients over the age of fifty for whom the final outcome was available. For each patient, the CXR severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the MV use, the patient outcome, comorbidities, corticosteroid use, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were considered. Nonparametric statistical tests were used to compare the data obtained from the two waves. RESULTS The CXR severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the in-hospital mortality, and CRP levels were significantly higher in the first wave than in the second wave (p ≤ .041). Although not statistically significant, the frequency of MV use was higher in the first wave. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary investigation seems to confirm that the COVID-19 second wave is less severe and deadly than the first wave.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1884745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560897/";09/02/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9538
441;SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion by variant B.1.427/B.1.429;10.1101/2021.03.31.437925;SARS-CoV-2 entry is mediated by the spike (S) glycoprotein which contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) as the two main targets of neutralizing antibodies (Abs). A novel variant of concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429) was originally detected in California and is currently spreading throughout the US and 29 additional countries. It is unclear whether antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the prototypic Wuhan-1 isolate-based vaccines will be impacted by the three B.1.427/B.1.429 S mutations: S13I, W152C and L452R. Here, we assessed neutralizing Ab responses following natural infection or mRNA vaccination using pseudoviruses expressing the wildtype or the B.1.427/B.1.429 S protein. Plasma from vaccinated or convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers, which were reduced 3-6 fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wildtype pseudoviruses. The RBD L452R mutation reduced or abolished neutralizing activity of 14 out of 35 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including three clinical-stage mAbs. Furthermore, we observed a complete loss of B.1.427/B.1.429 neutralization for a panel of mAbs targeting the N-terminal domain due to a large structural rearrangement of the NTD antigenic supersite involving an S13I-mediated shift of the signal peptide cleavage site. These data warrant closer monitoring of signal peptide variants and their involvement in immune evasion and show that Abs directed to the NTD impose a selection pressure driving SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution through conventional and unconventional escape mechanisms.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821281/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.31.437925";01/04/2021;receptor-binding domain;0.9282

Due to its infection rate and severity, it has emerged as one of the major global threats of the current generation. To support the current combat against the disease, this research aims to propose a machine learning–based pipeline to detect COVID-19 infection using lung computed tomography scan images (CTI). This implemented pipeline consists of a number of sub-procedures ranging from segmenting the COVID-19 infection to classifying the segmented regions. The initial part of the pipeline implements the segmentation of the COVID-19–affected CTI using social group optimization–based Kapur’s entropy thresholding, followed by k-means clustering and morphology-based segmentation. The next part of the pipeline implements feature extraction, selection, and fusion to classify the infection. Principle component analysis–based serial fusion technique is used in fusing the features and the fused feature vector is then employed to train, test, and validate four different classifiers namely Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function, and Decision Tree.

443;Catastrophic bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss following COVID-19.;10.1136/bcr-2021-243157;Since December 2019, when it was first detected in Wuhan, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has spread across the globe. The pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the global population with >110 million confirmed cases and 2.5 million deaths. The most common initial symptoms of COVID-19 infection are cough, dyspnoea, fever, malaise and anosmia. Severe clinical manifestations include respiratory compromise, pneumonia, organ failure and death. There have been many other less common symptoms as a result of COVID-19 described in the literature, including significant rates of olfactory dysfunction. However, we believe there has been only one other previously documented cases of bilateral hearing loss.Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a relatively common presentation seen by otolaryngologists. It is defined as rapid hearing loss, ≥30 dB occurring over 3 consecutive days in three contiguous sound frequencies. The exact pathological process is yet to be fully characterised, though it is most commonly unilateral and commonly develops shortly following viral infection. Treatment typically consists of glucocorticoid steroids administered orally, via intratympanic injection or a combination of both routes though there are currently no standardised management of these patients.Bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is rare, accounting for <2% of all cases. We describe a case of bilateral SSNHL in a 68-year-old patient who presented with profound hearing loss shortly after symptomatic infection with COVID-19, which at the time of publication is the first such case reported in the literature.;"https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-243157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34167987/";24/06/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.9799
444;Short-term insomnia disorder in health care workers in an academic medical center before and during COVID-19: rates and predictive factors.;10.5664/jcsm.9034;"STUDY OBJECTIVES This study investigated risk factors and estimated rates of acute insomnia disorder in health care workers at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A Qualtrics survey of more than 2,300 health care providers was conducted in a single academic health system on May 15, 2020 including practicing attending physicians, residents and fellows in training, advanced practice providers, and nurses. Six hundred and sixty-eight responded (29% response rate). The survey employed the Research Diagnostic Criteria for insomnia disorder to diagnose acute insomnia disorder. RESULTS 573 respondents had no missing data pertaining to sleep, with a mean age of 43.4 + 12.5 years and 72% women. The rate of insomnia disorder before COVID-19 was 44.5%, while after COVID-19 it was 64.0%. 10.2% of persons with insomnia disorder before COVID-19 stated it had resolved during COVID-19, while 43.4% of persons who did not have insomnia disorder before COVID-19 developed acute insomnia disorder during COVID-19 (χ2=145.2; df=1; P<0.0001). New cases of acute insomnia disorder were related positively to female gender, advancing age, and less time spent in direct patient care. CONCLUSIONS Acute insomnia disorder was exceptionally common in this sample of tertiary care health care workers. The effects of gender and age were similar to what has been generally described as risk factors for insomnia. The surprising finding that less time spent in direct patient care was associated with more cases of acute insomnia disorder might be explained by the poorly understood stresses of working from home during COVID-19.";"https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.9034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33226333/";23/11/2020;acute insomnia disorder;0.9681
445;A forecasting method with efficient selection of variables in multivariate data sets;10.1007/s41870-021-00619-9;Regression is a kind of data analysis technique in which the relationship between the independent variable(x) and dependent variable(y) is modeled and for polynomial regression it is up to the nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted by E (y|x). In this paper polynomial regression analysis has been improved through efficient selection of variables that is coefficient of determination. Coefficient of determination is a square of the correlation between new predicted y values and actual y values and its values are in the range from 0 to 1. The main purpose of regression analysis is to discover the relationship among the independent and dependent variables or in other words it is an explanation of variation in one variable with another variable. In this paper, the main focus is on Multivariate data sets that have many attributes and it is not necessary that all variables are required for data analysis purposes. Using coefficient of determination (COD) irrelevant attributes get eliminated during analysis. The main objective of research is to reduce the cost of data maintenance, reduce the execution time and improve the prediction accuracy rate. COD helps in selecting suitable independent variables. It is a notch that is used in statistical analysis that assesses how well a model explains and forecasts upcoming outcomes. This method also helps in eliminating the irrelevant variables which are not required for the prediction model by this maintenance cost and size of data sets can be reduced.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s41870-021-00619-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33681697/";28/02/2021;coefficient of determination;0.9394

Methods: 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the General Hospital of Central Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army between January 18 and February 26, 2020, were recruited. Two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (rN) and spike protein (rS) were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies, and their diagnostic feasibility was evaluated. Results: Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully diagnosed with the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and 159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively. The positive rates of the rN-based and rS-based ELISAs for antibody (IgM and/or IgG) detection were 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the rN-based ELISA. We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with an increasing number of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM dropped after 35 d.p.o. The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness 0-10 d.p.o., and that of IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o.

METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection, comparing standard of care along with Convalescent Plasma with or without Tocilizumab (CP vs. CPT). RESULTS A total of 110 patients were enrolled with an overall mean age of 50 ± 16 years. Patients on CPT were more likely to have had acute respiratory distress syndrome (77% vs. 42%; p < 0.001), sepsis (9.7% vs. 0; p = 0.036), chest X-ray abnormealities (71% vs. 44%; p = 0.004), intensive care unit admission (84% vs. 56%; p = 0.001) as well as being on mechanical ventilation (79% vs. 48%; p = 0.001). After CPT treatment, all measured inflammatory markers, except interleukine-6, showed an overall steady decline over time (all p-values <0.05) and the ventilatory parameters showed significant improvement of PaO2/FiO2 ratio from 127 to 188 within 7 days (p < 0.001). Additionally, 52% (32/62) of the patients had favorable outcome, either as improvement of ventilatory parameters or extubation within 14 days of hospitalization. However, mortality rate in those on CPT was higher than those who received CP alone (24% vs. 8.3%; p = 0.041).

During the lockdown, the general population delayed sleep timing and spent more time in bed; however, little is known on the effects of COVID-19 restriction on children and adolescents suffering type 1 narcolepsy. In the last months of 2019, we performed follow-up actigraphy in 18 type 1 narcolepsy children and adolescents under stable pharmacological treatment with sodium oxybate. We contacted these patients for a follow-up actigraphy during the first Italian lockdown. Actigraphs and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for children and adolescents (ESS-CHAD) have been sent to participants' homes. Differences in motor activity were analysed through functional linear modelling. During lockdown, type 1 narcolepsy children and adolescents went to bed and woke up later, slept more during the daytime and napped more frequently. No difference emerged in time in bed, estimated total sleep time and nocturnal sleep quality. Similarly, no difference emerged in ESS-CHAD and body mass index. The time-series analysis of motor activity documented reduced activity during the early morning and in the evening during the lockdown period compared with pre-lockdown.

449;[Burnout syndrome among Italian nursing staff during the COVID 19 emergency. Multicentric survey study].;10.7429/pi.2020.734250;AIM To analyze the prevalence of Burnout defined by the MBI-GS among Italian nursing staff during the COVID-19 emergency. INTRODUCTION The recent health emergency which in the first half of 2020 has seen Italy involved in the management of patients with COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19), has led to further stress for hospitals both in terms of beds and in terms of workload for healthcare workers. METHOD A multicenter study was conducted. A convenience sample of 208 nurses participated in the study. Between March 20 and July 20, 2020, the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) questionnaire was made available online by using the Google Forms platform in order to detect and measure the severity of Burnout Syndrome (BOS). RESULTS BOS-related symptoms (medium or high score) for individual MBI-GS domains were identified in at least 68% of nurses. One hundred and sixty-one nurses (77.4%) had a risk of emotional exhaustion, 143 (68.7%) of depersonalization, and 162 (77.9%) of reduced professional accomplishment. High risk was observed among nurses who managed COVID patients at their own operating unit (RR = 1.27, p = 0.016). Severe BOS risk was observed in 146 nurses analyzed (70.2%) with an increased risk among Intensive Care nurses. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the nurses during the coronavirus pandemic, had high levels of work-related suffering and were at risk of physical and emotional exhaustion. Further research should be undertaken to establish causal relationships between BOS and personal and environmental risk factors among healthcare professionals in relation to the COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.7429/pi.2020.734250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780608/";01/01/2020;COronaVIrus Disease 19;0.9732
450;Spherical mesoporous covalent organic framework as a solid-phase extraction adsorbent for the ultrasensitive determination of sulfonamides in food and water samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.;10.1016/j.chroma.2020.461275;Efficient extraction of polar sulfonamides antibiotics from aqueous samples and food is very challenging, because they are hydrophilic, their concentration is very low, and the matrix is complex. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a novel porous organic material, have attracted great attention. In this work, the spherical triphenylbenzene-dimethoxyterephthaldehyde-COFs (TPB-DMTP-COFs) were synthesized by a simple room temperature method, and due to their attractive properties, such as high outstanding acid-base stability, large specific surface area, low skeletal density, inherent porosity and high crystallinity, so TPB-DMTP-COFs as ideal solid phase extraction adsorbents showed excellent adsorption performance for trace polar sulfonamides in food and water. TPB-DMTP-COFs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and so on. The important parameters were optimized to improve the extraction efficiency of TPB-DMTP-COFs toward sulfonamides. Analysis of sulfonamides was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The developed method based on TPB-DMTP-COFs material achieved low limits of detection (0.5-1.0 ng L-1), wide linearity (5-1000 ng L-1), and good repeatability (2.5%-8.7%). The possible extraction mechanism was also discussed. Finally, the method was successfully applied to the enrichment and detection of sulfonamides in environmental water samples and food samples. The present study indicated that TPB-DMTP-COFs had splendid prospects in highly sensitive analysis of other pollutants in complex matrix.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.461275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709327/";16/08/2020;Covalent organic frameworks;0.9644
451;Gamma-oryzanol as a possible PPAR-γ agonist in adipose tissue may represents a coadjutant therapeutic to prevent cytokine storm in COVID-19 obese patients;10.1016/j.mce.2020.111095;The literature has reported a higher prevalence of negative clinical outcomes due to Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in obese individuals. This can be explained by the cytokine storm, result from the cytokine production from both obesity and viral infection. Gamma-oryzanol (γOz) is a compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, little is known about the γOz action as a possible agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that γOz attenuates the cytokine storm by stimulating PPAR-γ in the adipose tissue. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups and fed ad libitum for 30 weeks with control diet (C, n = 6), high sugar- fat diet (HSF, n = 6) or high sugar- fat diet + γOz (HSF + γOz, n = 6). HSF groups also received water + sucrose (25%). The γOz dose was 0.5% in the chow. Evaluation in animals included caloric intake, body weight, adiposity index, plasma triglycerides, and HOMA-IR. In adipose tissue was evaluated: PPAR-γ gene and protein expression, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters, and histological analysis. RESULTS: Adipose tissue dysfunction was observed in HSF group, which presented remarkable PPAR-γ underexpression and increased levels of cytokines, other inflammatory markers and oxidative stress. The γOz treatment prevented adipose tissue dysfunction and promoted PPAR-γ overexpression. CONCLUSION: Natural compounds as γOz can be considered a coadjutant therapy to prevent the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients with obesity conditions.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33253762/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.111095; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030372072030397X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030372072030397X";28/11/2020;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9268

However, there is limited information on the quality of antibody response generated following vaccination by these vaccine modalities. To better understand antibody response induced by spike protein-based vaccines, we immunized rabbits with various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigens: S-ectodomain (S1+S2) (aa 16-1213), which lacks the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (CT-TM), the S1 domain (aa 16-685), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (aa 319-541), and the S2 domain (aa 686-1213 as control). Antibody response was analyzed by ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) against different Spike proteins in native conformation, and a pseudovirion neutralization assay to measure the quality and function of the antibodies elicited by the different Spike antigens. All three antigens (S1+S2 ectodomain, S1 domain, and RBD) generated strong neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination induced antibody repertoire was analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 spike Genome Fragment Phage Display Libraries (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL), which identified immunodominant epitopes in the S1, S1-RBD and S2 domains. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that surprisingly the RBD immunogen elicited a higher antibody titer with 5-fold higher affinity antibodies to native spike antigens compared with other spike antigens. These findings may help guide rational vaccine design and facilitate development and evaluation of effective therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19 disease.

453;BLUEPRINT FOR PANDEMIC RESPONSE: FOCUS ON TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, AND PHARMACOMETRICS.;10.1111/bcp.14859;Perhaps the most important lesson learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that of preparedness. Enhanced surveillance systems for early threat detection will be crucial to maximizing response time for implementation of public health measures and mobilization of resources in containing an emerging pandemic. Recent outbreaks have been dominated by viral pathogens with RNA respiratory viruses being the most likely to have pandemic potential. These should therefore be a preparedness priority. Tools in the areas of virology, drug discovery, clinical pharmacology, translational medicine, and pharmacometrics should be considered key components in the rapid identification and development of existing and novel interventions for a pandemic response. Prioritization of therapeutics should be based on in vitro activity, likelihood of achieving effective drug concentrations at the site of action, and safety profile at the doses that will be required for clinical efficacy. Deployment strategies must be tailored to the epidemiology of the disease, and the adequacy of the response should be re-evaluated in view of evolving epidemiological factors. An interdisciplinary framework integrating drug pharmacology, viral kinetics, epidemiology and health economics could help optimize the deployment strategy by improving decision-making around who to treat, when to treat, and with what type of intervention for optimal outcomes. Lastly, while an effective vaccine will ultimately end a pandemic, antiviral drug intervention guided by clinical pharmacology principles will continue to play a critical role in any pandemic response.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855747/";14/04/2021;preparedness;0.9019

These various types of cells have several important functions; thus, communication between these cells plays an important role in homeostasis as well as in the pathophysiology of diseases in the lungs. For a better understanding of the pathophysiology of lung diseases, researchers have isolated each type of lung cell to investigate the changes in their gene expressions, including their humoral factor or adhesion molecules, to reveal the intercellular communication among these cells. In particular, investigations during the past decade have focused on extracellular vesicles, which are lipid bilayer delimited vesicles released from a cell that can move among various cells and transfer substances, including microRNAs, mRNAs and proteins, thus, functioning as intercellular messengers. Extracellular vesicles can be classified into three general groups: apoptotic bodies, exosomes, and microparticles. Extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes and microparticles, are attracting increasing attention from pulmonologists as tools for understanding pathogenesis and disease diagnosis. Here, we review studies, including our own, on exosomes and microparticles and their roles in both lung homeostasis and the pathogenesis of lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive lung diseases, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

455;Hydroxychloroquine treatment in European patients with lupus erythematosus: dosing, retinopathy screening and adherence;10.1136/lupus-2021-000478;BACKGROUND: Use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is common in patients with lupus erythematosus. Long-term use (ie, ≥5 years) and high-dose HCQ (ie, >5 mg/kg/day) are both risk factors for developing HCQ retinopathy. Advances in our understanding of HCQ retinopathy have led to changes in the recommendations for HCQ dosing and retinopathy screening. The latest EULAR guidelines for the management of SLE recommend a maximum HCQ dose of 5 mg/kg/day and ophthalmological screening at baseline and annually after 5 years of HCQ treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess whether the EULAR guidelines are affecting HCQ prescription patterns and screening frequencies in Europe. Furthermore, we inventoried adherence to HCQ. RESULTS: The online questionnaire was completed by 2936 patients with systemic, cutaneous or juvenile lupus from 33 countries. The majority were female (86.5%) and diagnosed with SLE (81.2%). Among those taking HCQ, the median HCQ dose reported was 4.26 mg/kg/day. More than one-third of respondents (36.8%) exceeded the recommended maximal HCQ dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Baseline ophthalmological screening had been done in 857 out of 1017 respondents diagnosed in the past 10 years (84.3%). Of patients using HCQ ≥5 years, 69.2% reported yearly retinopathy screening. Lastly, 17.3% of patients reported that they skipped HCQ once a week or more often. CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrate that higher than recommended dosages of HCQ are prescribed to more than one-third of patients with lupus in Europe. Recent recommendations regarding screening for retinopathy are incompletely implemented.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021889/;01/04/2021;Use of hydroxychloroquine;0.9284
456;Epidemiologic changes and novelties on vaccination against Bordetella pertussis in Latin America.;10.4067/s0716-10182021000200232;Although whooping cough is a vaccine-preventable disease (VPD), its epidemiologic characteristics in Latin America shows persistence of outbreaks in the region. This persistence is due, at least in part, to the presence of antivaccine movements, the diversity of the surveillance systems, and the lack of a uniform case definition for the region. Given the importance of whooping cough in Latin America and the changes in vaccine recommendations, this manuscript aims to review epidemiologic data and recent changes in the vaccination calendars and their impact on the pediatric disease by Bordetella pertussis in Latin America. Recent epidemiological data reveal that between regions, countries, and administrative units within each country there is a marked heterogeneity of vaccine coverage, with different outbreak patterns. Efforts in the region have tried to improve this situation by introducing acellular pertussis vaccines (aP) in the vaccine calendars, which are less reactogenic than whole-cell pertussis vaccines (wP). Moreover, some countries have improved the case definition. Some countries have implemented a confirmed case definition by introducing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a diagnostic criterion. As a response to the heterogeneities observed within and between countries and the regional epidemiologic profiles, a Steering Committee from the Latin American Society for Pediatric Infectiology (SLIPE) and the Latin American Association of Pediatrics (ALAPE) propose a unified case definition and recommendations to improve vaccine coverage and reduce the outbreaks of whooping cough in Latin America.;"https://doi.org/10.4067/s0716-10182021000200232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34184715/";01/04/2021;vaccine-preventable disease;0.9291
457;The incubation period of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19): A tremendous public health threat—Forecasting from publicly available case data in India;10.1002/pa.2619;"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Coronavirus Disease (COVID‐19) a pandemic due to the huge upsurge in the number of reported cases worldwide. The COVID‐19 pandemic in India has become a public health threat, and if we go by the number of confirmed cases then the situation seems to be a matter of grave concern. According to real‐time data, the numbers of confirmed cases are growing exponentially. No doubt, substantial public health interventions both at the national and state levels are implemented immediately by the Government of India; there is a need for improved preparedness plans and mitigation strategies along with accurate forecasting. The present study aims to forecast the COVID‐19 outbreak infected cases in India. The data have been obtained from https://www.covid19india.org, https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus, and ICMR reported publicly available information about COVID‐19 confirmation cases. We have used the double exponential smoothing method for forecasting the trends in terms of confirmed, active, recovered and death cases from COVID‐19 for emergency preparedness and future predictions. Findings reveal that the estimated value of point forecast is just 8.22% of the total number of confirmed cases reported on a daily basis across the country. It was observed that the deaths were lower for the states and union territories with a higher detection rate.

458;Abnormal Fibrinogen Level as a Prognostic Indicator in Coronavirus Disease Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study;10.3389/fmed.2021.687220;Purpose: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a global threat, and identification of its prognostic biomarkers could prove invaluable. Fibrinogen (FIB) could be one such indicator as coagulation and fibrinolysis abnormalities are common among COVID-19 patients. We examined the role of FIB levels in the prognosis of COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 1,643 COVID-19 patients from the Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. The follow-up was conducted from February 8, 2020 to April 15, 2020. The cohort was divided into three groups according to the FIB level on admission, and associations with mortality and disease severity were determined using Cox and logistic regression analyses, respectively. Further, Kaplan–Meier (K–M) analyses by log-rank tests were used to assess the survival of patients with varying FIB levels. Results: Patients with FIB < 2.2 g/L [hazard ratio (HR): 9.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.91–42.59, P = 0.006] and >4.2 g/L (HR: 4.79, 95% CI: 1.14–20.20, P = 0.033) showed higher mortality risks compared to those with FIB between 2.2 and 4.2 g/L. The survival curves showed similar results in K–M analyses (P < 0.001). Additionally, an elevated FIB level was associated with a greater risk of developing critical disease (odds ratio: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.04–4.46, P = 0.038) than a FIB level within the normal range.

459;A 61-Year-Old Woman with Chronic Iron-Deficiency Anemia Due to a Cameron Lesion and a Response to Oral Application of Combined Poloxamer 407 with Hyaluronic Acid and Chondroitin Sulfate Following Single Treatment with Pantoprazole: A Case Report;10.12659/ajcr.928021;Patient: Female, 61-year-old Final Diagnosis: Cameron lesions Symptoms: Anemia • melena Medication: — Clinical Procedure: Gastroscopy Specialty: Gastroenterology and Hepatology • Surgery OBJECTIVE: Rare disease BACKGROUND: Cameron lesions are linear erosions and ulcers on the crests of gastric mucosal folds in the neck of a hiatal hernia and can be difficult to diagnose and treat. This report is of a case of chronic iron deficiency in a 61-year-old woman with a late diagnosis of a Cameron lesion, who did not respond to a single treatment with the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) pantoprazole, but was then treated with oral poloxamer 407 with hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate in addition to PPI. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 61-year-old women with recurrent iron-deficiency anemia, first diagnosed 40 years prior to her presentation at our Endoscopy Unit, and an ongoing melena. We discovered an intrahiatal gastric mucosal defect, which we at first treated with proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate. After a follow-up gastroscopy revealed the persistence of the lesion, we decided to incorporate into the treatment a gel-like substance containing, among others, hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, and observed that the lesion resolved completely. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights that Cameron lesions should be considered in patients with hiatal hernia who have iron-deficiency anemia and can be diagnosed on upper endoscopy. Further clinical studies are required to determine the role of combined poloxamer 407 with hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate in the management of Cameron lesions.;"https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.928021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33473099/";21/01/2021;Rare disease;0.9118
460;Impact of COVID-19 Infection on 24 Patients with Sickle Cell Disease. One Center Urban Experience, Detroit, MI, USA.;10.1080/03630269.2020.1797775;The city of Detroit has a large population of individuals with sickle cell disease, and hospitals in Detroit have seen some of the highest numbers of cases of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in 2020. The purpose of this study was to examine the pathophysiological characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with sickle cell disease or trait to determine whether these patients have unique manifestations that might require special consideration. This retrospective analysis included 24 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and sickle cell disease or trait who were seen at the Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA, between March 1 and April 15 2020. Of the 24 patients, 18 (75.0%) had heterozygous sickle cell trait, one (4.0%) was a double heterozygote for Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T)/β+-thalassemia (β+-thal), four had sickle cell anemia (βS/βS) and one (4.0%) had Hb S/Hb C (HBB: c.19G>A) disease. A total of 13 (54.0%) patients required hospitalization. All four patients with sickle cell anemia, developed acute pain crisis. We observed one patient who developed acute pulmonary embolism and no patients developed other sickle cell associated complications. Additionally, three (13.0%) patients required packed red blood cell transfusion without the need of exchange transfusion, and one patient required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and subsequently died. Patients with sickle cell disease or trait and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 had a generally mild, or unremarkable, course of disease, with lower chances of intubation, ICU admission and death, but with a slightly longer hospitalization.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/03630269.2020.1797775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32722950/";28/07/2020;coronavirus disease-19;0.9284
461;COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus 2019) - recent trends.;10.26355/eurrev_202002_20378;The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning that, although the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan City (China), is not pandemic, it should be contained to prevent the global spread. The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense. This mini-review aims at investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202002_20378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32141569/";01/02/2020;coronavirus;0.9442
462;The main factors affecting Taiwan’s economic growth rate via dynamic grey relational analysis;10.1371/journal.pone.0240065;Ever since the grey system theory was proposed about 40 years ago, its characteristics such as small samples, few data, and uncertainty have been used for study in the literature with increasingly wider scope. Recent studies on grey relation analysis have included static data analyses, and most of them have adopted initial values with only a relational order. Under the same study conditions, if different data preprocessing methods are used, then the relational order will be ranked differently. This study took Taiwan as the object to explore seven economic indices (birth rate (%), Taiwan’s total population (thousand people), unemployment rate (%), income per capita (USD), weighted average interest rate on deposits (%), Consumer Price Index (CPI), and national income (NI)) and how they affect the economic growth rate. The traditional static grey relational analysis treated the collected data with taking consideration of time effect which is irrational under some circumstance. An innovative dynamic grey relational analysis was carried out by shifting the raw data due to the time leading or lagging effect which is a mean to improve the capability of traditional grey relational analysis. The differences in analyses between static grey relational analysis and dynamic grey relational analysis via different data preprocessing methods were further discussed, finding that different data preprocessing methods generated a new set of relational orders through the latter. Finally, the prosperity index was used to identify the effects of all factors on economic growth (leading, synchronization, and lagging indices).;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33017439/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240065";05/10/2020;Consumer Price Index;0.9945
463;Prevalence of illicit tobacco use and tobacco tax avoidance in pregnancy;10.1007/s11845-020-02487-x;"BACKGROUND: Smoking during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Tobacco tax avoidance and tax evasion undermine the effectiveness of tobacco tax policies, resulting in cheaper prices for smokers and increased tobacco usage. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to explore the purchasing habits of pregnant smokers with regard to tobacco expenditure and use of illicit tobacco. METHODS: Prospective cohort study. Face to face interviews were conducted with 90 attendees (age range 18–42 years; mean age 28 years) of a smoking cessation antenatal clinic in a large Irish tertiary level maternity hospital. Information regarding smoking habits, quantity of tobacco smoked, and location of purchase of tobacco was collected in addition to socioeconomic details. Tobacco products were examined to establish whether these were purchased from legitimate sources. RESULTS: 76.6% of women smoked 10 or fewer cigarettes per day. The mean weekly spend on tobacco was €39. Seventeen women (18.8%) smoked roll-your-own tobacco. One woman (1.1%) currently possessed a pack of illicit tobacco, while another 5.5% of participants had purchased illicit tobacco in the past. Four women (4.4%) practiced tobacco tax avoidance by purchasing tobacco abroad or in Duty Free. CONCLUSIONS: Use of illicit tobacco is low and only a minority of women engaged in tobacco tax avoidance. As the average price of tobacco in Ireland increases, weekly expenditure on tobacco products is a significant financial impact on low-income women. Smoking cessation would deliver significant financial gains in addition to health benefits.";"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02487-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439415/";13/01/2021;Smoking during pregnancy;0.9207
464;Levosimendan use in patients with acute heart failure and reduced ejection fraction with or without severe renal dysfunction in critical cardiac care units: a multi-institution database study;10.1186/s13613-021-00810-y;BACKGROUND: Acute heart failure is a life-threatening clinical condition. Levosimendan is an effective inotropic agent used to maintain cardiac output, but its usage is limited by the lack of evidence in patients with severely abnormal renal function. Therefore, we analyzed data of patients with acute heart failure with and without abnormal renal function to examine the effects of levosimendan. METHODS: We performed this retrospective cohort study using data from the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). Patients admitted for heart failure with LVEF ≤ 40% between January 2013 and December 2018 who received levosimendan or dobutamine in the critical cardiac care units (CCU) were identified. Patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were excluded. Outcomes of interest were mortality at 30, 90, and 180 days after the cohort entry date. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mortality rate at 30, 90, and 180 days after the cohort entry date between the levosimendan and dobutamine groups, or between subgroups of patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or on dialysis. The results were consistent before and after propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS: Levosimendan did not increase short- or long-term mortality rates in critical patients with acute heart failure and reduced ejection fraction compared to dobutamine, regardless of their renal function. An eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was not necessarily considered a contraindication for levosimendan in these patients.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869075/;08/02/2021;Acute heart failure;0.9261
465;Risk of severe herpes zoster infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease: A nation-wide cohort study with propensity score matching analysis.;10.1111/ijcp.13675;"BACKGROUND Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is suggested to be likely associated with underlying immunological dysregulation. This lymphopenia poses a risk of viral infection. Data to elucidate the herpes virus infection risk in patients with PKD are lacking; therefore, we conducted a national-wide population-based cohort study to investigate the herpes virus risk in PKD patients. METHODS From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease were defined as case group of PKD patients; patients without any diagnosis of PKD during the study period were grouped into the non-PKD cohort. The index date was set as the date when the patients were newly diagnosed with PKD. All study patients were followed up until the occurrence of herpes zoster infection, death, withdrawal from the NHIRD for other reasons, or until December 31, 2013. RESULTS We included 4366 PKD patients and 4366 non-PKD patients. The incidence rate and the risk of developing herpes zoster infection were estimated using multivariate stratified analyses. PKD patients had a 1.97-fold risk of herpes zoster virus infection (aHR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.17-3.31) compared with the non-PKD cohort. On multi-layer stratification, PKD patients without any comorbidities had a significantly increased risk of herpes zoster infection (aHR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.37-7.00). CONCLUSION This is the first study to reveal a high risk of severe herpes zoster infection in patients with PKD.

466;Microsomic and macrosomic body structure in children and adolescents affected by syndromes or diseases associated with neurodysfunction.;10.1038/s41598-021-85587-7;In Poland the issue of microsomic body structure (micro-SBS) and macrosomic body structure (macro-SBS) has so far been overlooked. Up until now only a small amount of data have been published, most often as an overview of the problem. The current study was designed to investigate the co-occurrence of microsomic/macrosomic body structure (micro/macro-SBS) and congenital nervous system disorders or neurological syndromes with symptoms visible from infancy, based on essential data acquired during admission procedures at a neurological rehabilitation ward for children and adolescents. The study applied a retrospective analysis of data collected during hospitalization of 327 children and adolescents, aged 4-18 years who had been affected since infancy by congenital disorders of the nervous system and/or neurological syndromes associated with a minimum of one neurodysfunction. To identify subjects with microsomic or macrosomic body structure in the group of children and adolescents, the adopted criteria took into account z-score values for body height (z-score Ht), body weight (z-score Wt), head circumference (z-score HC), BMI (z-score BMI) and head circumference index (z-score HCI). The rates of micro/macro-SBS in the study group amounted to 7.3% and 0.6%, respectively. The findings show a more frequent co-occurrence of, as well as statistically significant correlations between, micro/macro-SBS and type of spasticity (cerebral palsy) (p = 0.024) as well as hydrocephalus not treated surgically (p < 0.001). Macro-SBS was found to more frequently co-occur with hemiplegia and hydrocephalus not treated surgically.;"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85587-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737592/";18/03/2021;head circumference index;0.9884
467;Mild ast elevation as an early sign of COVID-19 severity in a multicenter Madrid cohort.;10.17235/reed.2021.8007/2021;INTRODUCTION Liver enzyme elevation has been reported for SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) in heterogeneous cohorts, mainly from China. Comprehensive reports from other countries are needed. We dissect the pattern, evolution and predictive value of such abnormalities in a cohort from Madrid, Spain. METHODS Retrospective study with prospective 14-day follow-up of 373 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in five Madrid hospitals, including 50 outpatients. COVID-19 severe course was defined as need of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS A total of 33.1% hospitalised patients showed baseline AST elevation and 28.5% showed ALT elevation, contrasting with 12% and 8% of outpatients (P≤0.001). Baseline AST, ALT and GGT levels correlated with LDH and C-reactive protein levels (CRP) (r≤0.598, P<0.005). AST elevation was associated with other severity markers such as male sex, lymphopenia and pneumonia on X-ray (P<0.05 all). ALP and Bilirubin levels were rarely increased. Patients with elevated baseline AST displayed progressive normalization of this enzyme and increase in ALT and GGT levels. Patients with normal baseline AST showed a flattened evolution pattern with levels in range. Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 showed more frequently elevated baseline AST than those with a milder evolution (54.2% vs. 25.4%, P<0.001). Age, AST and CRP were independent risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. CONCLUSION Mild liver enzyme elevation is associated with COVID-19 severity. Baseline AST is an independent predictor of severe COVID-19 course, while it tends to normalize over time. ALT and GGT show late elevation.;"https://doi.org/10.17235/reed.2021.8007/2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947196/";05/05/2021;SARS-CoV-2 disease;0.9657

The rapid and sensitive immunoassays are urgently demanded for detecting specific antibodies as assistant diagnosis for primary screening of asymptomatic individuals, close contacts,suspected or recovered patients of COIVD-19 during the pandemic period. Methods: The recombinant receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-RBD) was used as the antigen to detect specific IgM and the mixture of recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (NP) and S-RBD were used to detect specific IgG by the newly designed quantum-dot lateral flow immunoassay strip (QD-LFIA), respectively. Results: A rapid and sensitive QD-LFIA based portable fluorescence smart-phone system was developed for detecting specific IgM/IgG to SARS-CoV-2 from 100 serum samples of COVID-19 patients and 450 plasma samples from healthy blood donors. Among 100 COVID-19 patients diagnosed with NAT previously, 3 were severe, 35 mild and 62 recovered cases. By using QD-LFIA, 78 (78%) and 99 (99%) samples from 100 COVID-19 patients serum were detected positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG, respectively, but only one sample (0.22%) was cross-reactive with S-RBD from 450 healthy blood donor plasmas that were collected from different areas of China. Conclusion: An ultrasensitive and specific QD-LFIA based portable fluorescence smart-phone system was developed fo r detection of specific IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could be used for investigating the prevalence or assistant diagnosis of COVID-19 in humans.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159392; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.20159392v1?rss=1";24/07/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9546
469;COVID-19 and Moral Distress/Moral Anguish Therapeutic Support for Healthcare Workers in Acute Care: Our Voice;10.1007/978-3-030-61442-3_3;In the midst of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, acute care healthcare workers (HWs) on the front lines are balancing fear and bravery to prioritize lifesaving efficiency for their patients and themselves. Given the complexity of their work, in particular its constant proximity to patients encountering life-altering events, HWs are at high risk for traumatic, stressful workplace experiences, including the phenomena known in tandem as moral distress/moral anguish (MDA). This chapter offers guidance on therapeutic practice skills needed by social workers (SWs) to help HWs identify and address their experiences of MDA. Case-based vignettes demonstrate how situations encountered within acute care settings challenge personal values and trigger personal memories, heightening the experience of MDA. The vignettes illustrate how two therapeutic approaches can be used to address MDA: reflective cycle (Gibbs, Learning by Doing: A Guide to Teaching and Learning Methods. Further Educational Unit, Oxford Polytechnic, Oxford, 1988) and transformative learning (Mezirow, Fostering Critical Reflection in Adulthood. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, 1990). Given a medical culture that prioritizes efficiency and often imposes strict time restraints on workers, it is challenging for HWs to reflect on and treat symptoms that indicate MDA. The opportunity for HWs to voice their distress and build self-care strategies represents their path toward healing from the extraordinary pressure and hardship the COVID-19 crisis has brought and toward strengthening their resilience in order to continue their profoundly benevolent work.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978604/;29/09/2020;coronavirus;0.9974
470;"Working through an ""infodemic"": The impact of COVID-19 news consumption on employee uncertainty and work behaviors.";10.1037/apl0000913;"Uncertainty is a defining feature of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, because uncertainty is an aversive state, uncertainty reduction theory (URT) holds that employees try to manage it by obtaining information. To date, most evidence for the effectiveness of obtaining information to reduce uncertainty stems from research conducted in relatively stable contexts wherein employees can acquire consistent information. Yet, research on crises and news consumption provides reasons to believe that the potential for information to mitigate uncertainty as specified by URT may break down during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating URT with research on crises and news consumption, we predict that consuming news information during crises-which tends to be distressing, constantly evolving, and inconsistent-will be positively related to uncertainty. This in turn may have negative implications for employee goal progress and creativity; two work outcomes that take on substantial significance in times of uncertainty and the pandemic. We further predict that death anxiety will moderate this relationship, such that the link between employees' news consumption and uncertainty is stronger for those with lower levels of death anxiety, compared to those with higher levels. We test our theorizing via an experience-sampling study with 180 full-time employees, with results providing support for our conceptual model. Our study reveals important theoretical and practical implications regarding information consumption during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rigorously controlled studies to date, however, have been limited in scope and have failed to produce results comparable to those reported in the grey literature. METHODS: Eighty healthy male participants will receive 14 doses of placebo or 10 μg lysergic acid diethylamide orally every 3rd day over a 6-week treatment protocol. A battery of personality, creativity, mood, cognition, and EEG plasticity measures, as well as resting-state fMRI imaging, will be administered at baseline and at the end of the protocol. Creativity, mood, and plasticity measures will additionally be assessed in the acute phase of the first dose. Daily functioning will be monitored with questionnaires and a wearable sleep and activity tracker. DISCUSSION: This study will rigorously examine the claims presented in the microdosing grey literature by pairing a comparable dosing protocol with objective measures. Potential therapeutic implications include future clinical trials to investigate microdosed psychedelics as a standalone treatment or as an augmentation of psychotherapy in the treatment of depression, addiction, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and palliative care.

472;Detection and characterization of chicken astrovirus associated with hatchery disease in commercial day-old turkeys in southwestern Nigeria;10.1007/s00705-021-05034-w;Infectious diseases are a major obstacle to profitable poultry production in Nigeria due to the mortality and severe economic losses they cause. In particular, they are a potent threat to attainment of the food security goals of government and national self-sufficiency in food production. Thus, there is a need for continuous monitoring of the nation’s poultry population for these diseases. As part of an ongoing investigation of enteric viruses associated with poor performance or hatchery diseases in commercial poultry in southwestern Nigeria, intestinal contents from 97 condemned or runted day-old commercial turkey poults were examined for turkey astroviruses, infectious bronchitis virus, chicken astrovirus (CAstV), avian nephritis virus, avian rotavirus, avian reovirus, fowl adenovirus, and chicken parvovirus by virus isolation, electron microscopy (EM), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and reverse transcription PCR. The samples were collected from five commercial hatcheries and five farms located in southwestern Nigeria. While all samples tested negative for other viruses, CAstV was detected in the majority (83.5%) of the birds, although some pleomorphic virus-like particles with surface projections that appeared fringed or fimbriated were observed in five of the cell culture samples by EM. Phylogenetic analysis revealed these CAstV strains belonged to the Bi clade. These findings not only implicate CAstV as the major cause of hatchery condemnations in commercial turkeys in southwestern Nigeria but also highlight the need for experimental studies to further establish its role in this disease condition.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759002/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-021-05034-w";23/03/2021;chicken astrovirus;0.9838

The present prebirth cohort study examined the relationship between BAIAP2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs8079781 and the risk of behavioral problems in Japanese children aged 5 years. Subjects were 1175 mother-child pairs. Emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity problems, peer problems, and low prosocial behavior were assessed using the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Compared with the CC genotype of SNP rs8079781, at least one T allele was significantly inversely related to childhood emotional problems: the adjusted OR was 0.68 (95% CI 0.46-0.998, P = 0.049). Nevertheless, this significant inverse association disappeared after adjustment for multiple comparisons (adjusted P = 0.245). No associations were observed between SNP rs8079781 and childhood conduct problems, hyperactivity problems, peer problems, or low prosocial behavior. An independent positive relationship was observed between smoking in the household during the first year of life and emotional problems in children with the CC genotype, but not in those with at least one T allele (P for interaction = 0.04). This study is the first to show that at least one T allele of SNP rs8079781 was independently associated with a reduced risk of emotional problems in children aged 5 years, but this inverse association fell below significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The influence of smoking in the household during the first year of life might rely on rs8079781.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-020-02203-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388796/";09/05/2020;prosocial behavior;0.9039
474;Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of suspected COVID-19 patients in the isolation ward in Guangzhou, China: a cohort study.;10.21037/atm-20-6600;Background Since there are reports of cases of 2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) asymptomatic carriers in China recently and fever is one of the main symptoms, we aimed to distinguish COVID-19 cases from other febrile patients with clinical examinations in this study. Methods A total of 134 suspected COVID-19 patients in the isolation ward of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University were recruited from January 23 to May 23, 2020. We analyze the pathogenic form and clinical characteristics. Results Among them, pathogens were identified in only 84 patients (62.7%), including 23 (17.1%) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), 30 (22.3%) with other viruses, 31 (25.0%) with other pathogens and 3 (3.5%) with mixed infections. The commonly observed symptoms of COVID-19 patients were cough, fever, fatigue, and muscle aches, which were significantly different than the symptoms of nonviral infections (P<0.05) but from those of other viral infections (P>0.05). Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase and the neutrophil/lymphocyte were found significantly high in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). The most common manifestations of COVID-19 patients were ground-glass opacities (100%) with or without lung consolidation, however, they also often showed involvement of several lobes of both lungs (P<0.05). Due to the clear differential diagnosis, the overall antibiotic use rate was 35.8% (31/87). Conclusions When diagnosing COVID-19, infections with other pathogens should not be ignored. Successful pathogen identification will support accurate treatment.;"https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-6600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987319/";01/04/2021;2019-coronavirus disease;0.9192

COVID‐19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is currently under investigation. We summarized clinical studies and other research data available as of May 5, 2020, on CCP therapy according to the Clinical Treatment Guideline of COVID‐19 Convalescent Plasma in China, as well as clinical experience at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, as part of a comprehensive anti‐epidemic strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As of May 5, 2020, when the epidemic was well‐controlled in China, healthcare databases and sources of English literature relating to convalescent plasma were searched and reviewed. Sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified. RESULTS: As of May 5, 2020, up to 2,000 samples of CCP had been collected across China and administered to 700 COVID‐19 patients. From donors, 200–400 mL of plasma were collected at each donation, with antibody titers >1:160. We identified three clinical studies for COVID‐19 in China. Analyses showed a statistically significant improvement in clinical outcomes compared with untreated cases (P<0.001). No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSION: From initial studies, convalescent plasma therapy appears effective and safe for COVID‐19. However, there is clearly a need for well‐designed RCTs (randomized controlled trials) or other formal studies to further evaluate the efficacy and any potential adverse effects of CCP.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32516839/; https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.12968";09/06/2020;coronavirus disease;0.928
476;Comparison of COVID-19 versus influenza on the incidence, features, and recovery from acute kidney injury in hospitalized United States Veterans.;10.1016/j.kint.2021.05.029;Acute kidney injury is a common complication in patients hospitalized with SARSCoV-2 (COVID-19), with prior studies implicating multiple potential mechanisms of injury. Although COVID-19 is often compared to other respiratory viral illnesses, few formal comparisons of these viruses on kidney health exist. In this retrospective cohort study, we compared the incidence, features, and outcomes of acute kidney injury among Veterans hospitalized with COVID-19 or influenza and adjusted for baseline conditions using weighted comparisons. A total of 3402 hospitalizations for COVID-19 and 3680 hospitalizations for influenza admitted between October 1, 2019 and May 31, 2020 across 127 Veterans Administration hospitals nationally were studied using the electronic medical record. Acute kidney injury occurred more frequently among those with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza (40.9% versus 29.4%, weighted analysis) and was more severe. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to require mechanical ventilation and vasopressors and experienced higher mortality. Proteinuria and hematuria were frequent in both groups but more common in COVID-19. Recovery of kidney function was less common in patients with COVID-19 and acute kidney injury but was similar among survivors. Thus, findings from this study confirm that acute kidney injury is more common and severe among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to influenza, a finding that may be driven largely by illness severity. Hence, the combined impact of these two illnesses on kidney health may be significant and have important implications for resource allocation.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253821005780?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2021.05.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34111501/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253821005780";07/06/2021;SARSCoV-2;0.9829
477;Using PARIHS framework to design a community-based COVID-19 intervention in rural Ghana;10.1101/2021.03.30.21254353;This study utilized the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework to guide the design of the evidence-based practice, COVID Preparedness & Outbreak Prevention Plan (CoCoPOPP) for rural communities in Ghana. Through a participatory academic-community team discussion, interactive dissemination, review of evidence about community-based interventions during Ebola, HIV/AIDS, and Influenza outbreaks via snowball sampling, continuous discourse within the design team, feedback from other local stakeholders and national experts, the evidence-based intervention was developed consistent with the PARIHS framework. By applying the three core elements of the PARIHS framework (that is, evidence, context and facilitation), the study developed orientation, logistic needs and planning as well as social mobilization. The components also included participants recruitment and training, communication, research and M&E plan, execution and technical assistance and facilitation with three overall aims: (1) meet a pressing health need during the COVID-19 pandemic in local underserved settings, (2) ensure that the strategy is informed by high-quality evidence from similar interventions in past outbreaks and (3) evaluate and learn from research on interventions to garner data for organizational use and to share insights on pandemic management and control with the Ghanaian government, wider global health and education community. Hence, CoCoPOPP can be implemented across other rural communities in Ghana and beyond, particularly in other Sub-Saharan African countries with similar cultural settings.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.30.21254353v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.30.21254353";04/04/2021;Preparedness & Outbreak Prevention Plan;0.9668
478;COVID-19: a review.;10.4081/monaldi.2020.1298;The enduring epidemic outbreak which started in Wuhan city of China, in December 2019 caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID- 19) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has created a dangerous and deadly Public Health disaster of International apprehension, with cases confirmed in several countries. This novel community health trouble is frightening the universe with clinical, psychological, emotional, collapse of health system and economical slowdown in each and every part of the world infecting nearly 200 countries. A highly virulent and pathogenic COVID-19 viral infection with incubation period ranging from two to fourteen days, transmitted by breathing of infected droplets or contact with infected droplets, belongs to the genus Coronavirus with its high mutation rate in the Coronaviridae. The likely probable primary reservoir could be bats, because genomic analysis discovered that SARSCoV-2 is phylogenetically interrelated to SARS-like bat viruses. The transitional resource of origin and transfer to humans is not known, however, the rapidly developing pandemic has confirmed human to human transfer. Approximately 1,016,128 reported cases, 211,615 recovered cases and 53,069 deaths of COVID-2019 have been reported to date (April 2, 2020). The symptoms vary from asymptomatic, low grade pyrexia, dry cough, sore throat, breathlessness, tiredness, body aches, fatigue, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, to severe consolidation and pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction leading to death with case fatality rate ranging from 2 to 3%.;"https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32498503/";14/05/2020;coronavirus;0.9878
479;The trajectory of loneliness in response to COVID-19.;10.1037/amp0000690;"Social distancing and ""stay-at-home"" orders are essential to contain the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), but there is concern that these measures will increase feelings of loneliness, particularly in vulnerable groups. The present study examined change in loneliness in response to the social restriction measures taken to control the coronavirus spread. A nationwide sample of American adults (N = 1,545; 45% women; ages 18 to 98, M = 53.68, SD = 15.63) was assessed on three occasions: in late January/early February 2020 (before the outbreak), in late March (during the President's initial ""15 Days to Slow the Spread"" campaign), and in late April (during the ""stay-at-home"" policies of most states). Contrary to expectations, there were no significant mean-level changes in loneliness across the three assessments (d = .04, p > .05). In fact, respondents perceived increased support from others over the follow-up period (d = .19, p < .01). Older adults reported less loneliness overall compared to younger age groups but had an increase in loneliness during the acute phase of the outbreak (d = .14, p < .05). Their loneliness, however, leveled off after the issuance of stay-at-home orders. Individuals living alone and those with at least one chronic condition reported feeling lonelier at baseline but did not increase in loneliness during the implementation of social distancing measures. Despite some detrimental impact on vulnerable individuals, in the present sample, there was no large increase in loneliness but remarkable resilience in response to COVID-19.

An initial report from the Vall dHebron COVID19 prospective cohort study.;10.1101/2020.05.07.20094599;"Background: Modulation of the immune system to prevent lung injury is being widely used against the new coronavirus disease (COVID19) despite the scarcity of evidence. Methods: We report preliminary results from the Vall dHebron prospective cohort study at Vall dHebron University Hospital, in Barcelona (Spain), including all consecutive patients who had a confirmed infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARSCoV2) and who were treated with tocilizumab until March 25th. The primary endpoint was mortality at 7 days after tocilizumab administration. Secondary endpoints were admission to the intensive care unit, development of ARDS and respiratory insufficiency among others. Results: 82 patients with COVID19 received at least one dose of tocilizumab. The mean (SD) age was 59.1 (19.8) years, 63% were male, 22% were of non Spanish ancestry, and the median (IQR) ageadjusted Charlson index at baseline was 3 (1 to 4) points. Respiratory failure and ARDS developed in 62 (75.6%) and 45 (54.9%) patients, respectively. Median time from symptom onset to ARDS development was 8 (5 to 11) days. The median time from symptom onset to the first dose of tocilizumab was 9 (7 to 11) days. Mortality at 7 days was 26.8%. Hazard ratio for mortality was 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.5 (age adjusted hazard ratio for mortality 2.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 5.8) if tocilizumab was administered after the onset of ARDS.

481;A Novel Inhalation Mask System to Deliver High Concentrations of Nitric Oxide Gas in Spontaneously Breathing Subjects.;10.3791/61769;Nitric Oxide (NO) is administered as gas for inhalation to induce selective pulmonary vasodilation. It is a safe therapy, with few potential risks even if administered at high concentration. Inhaled NO gas is routinely used to increase systemic oxygenation in different disease conditions. The administration of high concentrations of NO also exerts a virucidal effect in vitro. Owing to its favorable pharmacodynamic and safety profiles, the familiarity in its use by critical care providers, and the potential for a direct virucidal effect, NO is clinically used in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, no device is currently available to easily administer inhaled NO at concentrations higher than 80 parts per million (ppm) at various inspired oxygen fractions, without the need for dedicated, heavy, and costly equipment. The development of a reliable, safe, inexpensive, lightweight, and ventilator-free solution is crucial, particularly for the early treatment of non-intubated patients outside of the intensive care unit (ICU) and in a limited-resource scenario. To overcome such a barrier, a simple system for the non-invasive NO gas administration up to 250 ppm was developed using standard consumables and a scavenging chamber. The method has been proven safe and reliable in delivering a specified NO concentration while limiting nitrogen dioxide levels. This paper aims to provide clinicians and researchers with the necessary information on how to assemble or adapt such a system for research purposes or clinical use in COVID-19 or other diseases in which NO administration might be beneficial.;"https://doi.org/10.3791/61769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028428/";04/05/2021;coronavirus disease-2019;0.9175
482;Impact of rainwater harvesting on hydrological processes in a fragile watershed of South Asia.;10.1111/gwat.13099;Agricultural water management (AWM) interventions play an important role in ensuring sustainable food production and mitigating climate risks. This study was carried out in a watershed located in a low rainfall (400-600 mm) region of western India. The SWAT model was calibrated using surface runoff, soil loss and reservoir storage levels, between the year 2000 and 2006. The investigation indicated that the various AWM interventions increased groundwater recharge from 30 mm/year to 80 mm/year and reduced surface runoff from 250 mm/year to 100 mm/year. The intervention structures were refilled 2 to 3 times during the monsoon season depending on rainfall intensity and duration. The interventions have the advantage of building a resilient system by enhancing groundwater availability even in dry years, stimulating crop intensification and protecting the landscape from severe erosion. The results indicate that soil erosion has been reduced by more than 75% compared to the non-intervention situation. Moreover, the AWM interventions led to the cultivation of 100-150 ha of fallow land with high value crops (horticulture, vegetables and fodder). Household income increased by several-folds compared to the non-intervention situation. The study showed about 50% reduction in downstream water availability, which could be a major concern. However, there are a number of ecosystem trade-offs such as improved base flow to the stream and reduction in soil loss that should be considered. The study is of great importance to stakeholders to decide on the optimum design for AWM interventions to achieve sustainable development goals.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.13099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763866/";25/03/2021;Agricultural water management;0.9339
483;Development of a Real-Time Risk Model (RTRM) for Predicting In-Hospital COVID-19 Mortality;10.1101/2021.04.26.21256138;"Background: With over 83 million cases and 1.8 million deaths reported worldwide by the end of 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), there is an urgent need to enhance identification of high-risk populations to properly evaluate therapy effectiveness with real-world evidence and improve outcomes. Methods: Baseline and daily indicators were evaluated using electronic health records for 46,971 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from 176 HCA Healthcare-affiliated hospitals, presenting from March to September 2020, to develop a real-time risk model (RTRM) of all-cause, hospitalized mortality. Patient facility, dates-of-care, clinico-demographics, comorbidities, vitals, laboratory markers, and respiratory support findings were aggregated in a logistic regression model. Findings: The RTRM predicted overall mortality as well as mortality 1, 3, and 7 days in advance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) of 0.905, 0.911, 0.905, and 0.901 respectively, significantly outperforming a combined model of age and daily modified WHO progression scale (all p<0.0001; AUCROC, 0.846, 0.848, 0.850, and 0.852). The RTRM delineated risk at presentation from ongoing risk associated with medical care and showed that mortality rates decreased over time due to both decreased severity and changes in care. Interpretation: To our knowledge, this study is the largest of its kind to comprehensively evaluate predictors and incorporate daily risk measures of COVID-19 mortality.

484;The novel zoonotic COVID-19 pandemic: An expected global health concern.;10.3855/jidc.12671;18 years ago, in 2002, the world was astonished by the appearance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), supported by a zoonotic coronavirus, called SARS-CoV, from the Guangdong Province of southern China. After about 10 years, in 2012, another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world.

Intense immediate postoperative pain after many spinal procedures makes its control of utmost importance. Preemptive injection of local anesthetics can significantly reduce postoperative pain during rest and movement; however, the analgesic effect is only maintained for a relatively short period of time. Whether betamethasone combined with local anesthetic for laminoplasty or laminectomy has better short-term and long-term effects than the local anesthetic alone has not been reported yet. METHODS The PRE-EASE trial is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint, single-center clinical study including 116 participants scheduled for elective laminoplasty or laminectomy, with a 6 months' follow-up process. Preemptive local infiltration with betamethasone and ropivacaine (treatment group) or ropivacaine alone (control group) throughout the entire thickness of the planned incision site will be performed by the surgeon prior to making the incision. The primary outcome will be the cumulative butorphanol consumption within the first 48-h postoperative period. DISCUSSION This study will add significant new knowledge to the effect and feasibility of preemptive local infiltration of betamethasone for postoperative pain management in laminoplasty and laminectomy.

486;Increased expression of antibiotic-resistance genes in biofilm communities upon exposure to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and other stress conditions.;10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144264;Quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC, e.g., cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, (CTAB)) are widely used as surfactants and disinfectants. QAC already are commonly found in wastewaters, and their concentration could increase, since QAC are recommended to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Exposure of bacteria to QAC can lead to proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). In particular, O2-based membrane biofilm reactors (O2-MBfRs) achieved excellent CTAB biodegradation, but ARG increased in their biofilms. Here, we applied meta-transcriptomic analyses to assess the impacts of CTAB exposure and operating conditions on microbial community's composition and ARG expression in the O2-MBfRs. Two opportunistic pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, dominated the microbial communities and were associated with the presence of ARG. Operating conditions that imposed stress on the biofilms, i.e., limited supplies of O2 and nitrogen or a high loading of CTAB, led to large increases in ARG expression, particularly for genes conferring antibiotic-target protection. Important within the efflux pumps was the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) family, which may have been active in exporting CTAB from cells. Oxidative stress appeared to be the key factor that triggered ARG proliferation by selecting intrinsically resistant species and accentuating the expression of ARG. Our findings suggest that means to mitigate the spread of ARG, such as shown here in a O2-based membrane biofilm reactor, need to consider the impacts of stressors, including QAC exposure and stressful operating conditions.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418325/";25/12/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9722
487;Access to palivizumab among children at high risk of respiratory syncytial virus complications in English hospitals;10.1101/2021.04.15.21255460;Objectives: Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody which can prevent infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Due to its high cost, it is recommended for high-risk infants only. We aimed to determine the proportion of infants eligible for palivizumab treatment in England who receive at least one dose. Methods: We used the Hospital Treatment Insights database containing hospital admission records linked to hospital pharmacy dispensing data for 43/153 hospitals in England. Infants born between 2010 and 2016 were considered eligible for palivizumab if their medical records indicated chronic lung disease (CLD), congenital heart disease (CHD), or severe immunodeficiency (SCID), and they met additional criteria based on gestational age at birth and age at start of the RSV season (beginning of October). We calculated the proportion of infants who received at least one dose of palivizumab in their first RSV season, and modelled the odds of treatment according to multiple child characteristics using logistic regression models. Results: We identified 3,712 eligible children, of whom 2,479 (67%) had complete information on all risk factors. Palivizumab was prescribed to 832 of eligible children (34%). Being born at <30 weeks' gestation, aged <6 months at the start of RSV season, and having two or more of CLD, CHD or SCID were associated with higher odds of treatment. Conclusion: In England, palivizumab is not prescribed to the majority of children who are eligible to receive it. Doctors managing these infants might be unfamiliar with the eligibility criteria or are constrained by other considerations, such as cost.;http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.15.21255460v1?rss=1;20/04/2021;congenital heart disease;0.9453
488;A longitudinal study of agriculture households in Indonesia: The effect of land and labor mobility on welfare and poverty dynamics;10.1016/j.wdp.2020.100261;The conventional wisdom of Arthur Lewis’s dual sector model says that households in the agricultural (traditional) sector who can move out to a non-agricultural (modern) sector will become better off. We then scrutinize the last three waves of the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) to analyze the existence of the dual theorem. Our study uses Difference in Difference (DiD) regressions and ordered logit regressions to confirm that moving out of agriculture sectors has significantly increased the welfare of poor agricultural households, especially in the period of 2000–2007, but this is not the case of 2007–2014. Movement out of agricultural sectors decreases the probability of being always poor by 13.5 percentage points. However, when the economy transforms into a more advanced economy, simply moving out of agriculture does not guarantee that farmers, especially landless farmers, will become better off. Welfare improvement requires a shifting to formal non-agricultural sectors, but unfortunately farmers might not be readily equipped with the skills required in formal sectors. Our study also obviously confirms that farmland is an important asset for agricultural households. Agricultural households experiencing a decrease of agricultural land also decreased their expenditure per capita by IDR 36,833 in 2000 and IDR 68,683 in 2007. These findings suggest that, currently, moving out of agriculture is not the solution to improve the well-being of farmers. Keeping farmland ownership, raising investment in human capital, and the modernization of agriculture should be the main concerns in agricultural development.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wdp.2020.100261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043170/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452292920300813; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452292920300813";02/10/2020;Difference in Difference;0.9833

Review of the Research;10.3390/s21113720;Supporting the development of a child with autism is a multi-profile therapeutic work on disturbed areas, especially understanding and linguistic expression used in social communication and development of social contacts. Previous studies show that it is possible to perform some therapy using a robot. This article is a synthesis review of the literature on research with the use of robots in the therapy of children with the diagnosis of early childhood autism. The review includes scientific journals from 2005–2021. Using descriptors: ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders), Social robots, and Robot-based interventions, an analysis of available research in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science was done. The results showed that a robot seems to be a great tool that encourages contact and involvement in joint activities. The review of the literature indicates the potential value of the use of robots in the therapy of people with autism as a facilitator in social contacts. Robot-Assisted Autism Therapy (RAAT) can encourage child to talk or do exercises. In the second aspect (prompting during a conversation), a robot encourages eye contact and suggests possible answers, e.g., during free conversation with a peer. In the third aspect (teaching, entertainment), the robot could play with autistic children in games supporting the development of joint attention. These types of games stimulate the development of motor skills and orientation in the body schema. In future work, a validation test would be desirable to check whether children with ASD are able to do the same with a real person by learning distrust and cheating the robot.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071829/";27/05/2021;Autism Spectrum Disorders;0.9791

Ground NO2 mapping with high spatiotemporal resolution is critical for fine-scale air pollution and environmental health research. We thus developed a spatiotemporal regression kriging model to map daily high-resolution (3-km) ground NO2 concentrations in China using the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite retrievals and geographical covariates. This model combined geographically and temporally weighted regression with spatiotemporal kriging and achieved robust prediction performance with sample-based and site-based cross-validation R2 values of 0.84 and 0.79. The annual mean and standard deviation of ground NO2 concentrations from June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019 were predicted to be 15.05 ± 7.82 μg/m3, with that in 0.6% of China's area (10% of the population) exceeding the annual air quality standard (40 μg/m3). The ground NO2 concentrations during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) period (January and February in 2020) was 14% lower than that during the same period in 2019 and the mean population exposure to ground NO2 was reduced by 25%. This study was the first to use TROPOMI retrievals to map fine-scale daily ground NO2 concentrations across all of China. This was also an early application to use the satellite-estimated ground NO2 data to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the air pollution and population exposures. These newly satellite-derived ground NO2 data with high spatiotemporal resolution have value in advancing environmental and health research in China.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477063/";08/01/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9228

Within 1500 m of the sites, LST ranged from 18.3 °C to 29.5 °C and 21.3 °C-29.7 °C for forest land and agricultural land, respectively. Linear regression shows a decreasing LST trend in forest land for five out of seven landfills. A similar trend, however, is not observed for agricultural land. Both the magnitude and the variability of LST are higher in agricultural land. The size of the bio-thermal zone is sensitive to the respective LULC class. The approximate bio-thermal zones for forest class and agricultural classes are about 170 ± 90 m and 180 ± 90 m from the landfill perimeter, respectively. For the forest class, NDVI was negatively correlated with LST at six out of seven Canadian landfills, and stronger relationships are observed in the agricultural class. NDVI data has a considerably larger spread and is less consistent than LST. LST data appears more appropriate for identifying landfill bio-thermal zones. A subtle difference in LST is observed among six LULC classes, averaging from 23.9 °C to 27.4 °C. Geometric shape makes no observable difference in LST in this study; however, larger landfill footprint appears to have higher LST.";"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725658/";13/03/2021;normalized difference vegetation index;0.9778
492;Challenges of following patients with inherited metabolic diseases during the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional online survey study.;10.1515/jpem-2020-0441;Background There has been a recent worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Most of the health system capacity has been directed to COVID-19 patients, and routine outpatient clinics have been suspended. Chronic disease patients, such as inherited metabolic disorders (IMD), have had trouble accessing healthcare services. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients with IMDs who were present for a follow-up at our clinic to address their problems during pandemic period. Our clinic's Instagram and Facebook accounts were used to invite the participants. Three reminders were given between May 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Survey questions were analyzed using descriptive statics. Results A total of 213 patients completed our survey. Incomplete surveys were excluded, and 175 questionnaires were evaluated. Most of patients had a special diet, and 51% of them had some difficulty with their diet. The reported rate of using a special treatment was 38%, and most of these patients (91%) had no problem receiving these special therapies during this time. Parents who were wearing masks while caring for their child were very few (17%), but a vast majority of parents (73.7%) had high handwashing rates. None of the patients had a SARS-COV2 infection until this paper was written. Conclusion This is the first study that aims to determine the problems faced by patients with IMD during the COVİD-19 period. Considering that the pandemic will not immediately pass, recognizing the problems faced by patients with chronic diseases and developing solutions would help these patients avoid long-term damage.;"https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2020-0441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185576/";12/11/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9445

We report on an 80-year old patient with pulmonary, renal, circulatory, and hepatic failure. We decided against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to old age and a SOFA-score of 13. However, the patient was continuously treated with the extracorporeal multi-organ- “ADVanced Organ Support” (ADVOS) device (ADVITOS GmbH, Munich, Germany). During eight 24h-treatment-sessions blood flow (100–300 mL/min), dialysate flow (160–320 mL/min) and dialysate pH (7.6–9.0) were adapted to optimize arterial PaCO(2) and pH. Effective CO(2) removal and correction of acidosis could be demonstrated by mean arterial- versus post-dialyzer values of pCO(2) (68.7 ± 13.8 vs. 26.9 ± 11.6 mmHg; p < 0.001). The CO(2)-elimination rate was 48 ± 23mL/min. The initial vasopressor requirement could be reduced in parallel to pH-normalization. Interruptions of ADVOS-treatment repeatedly resulted in reversible deteriorations of p(a)CO(2) and pH. After 95 h of continuous extracorporeal decarboxylating therapy the patient had markedly improved circulatory parameters compared to baseline. In the context of secondary pulmonary infection and progressive liver failure, the patient had a sudden cardiac arrest. In accordance with the presumed patient will, we decided against mechanical resuscitation. Irrespective of the outcome we conclude that extracorporeal CO(2) removal and multiorgan-support were feasible in this COVID-19-patient. Combined and less invasive approaches such as ADVOS might be considered in old-age-COVID-19 patients with MOF.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985328/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0391398820961781";28/09/2020;multi-organ failure;0.9484
494;Impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on NO(2) and PM(2.5) levels in major urban cities of Europe and USA;10.1016/j.cities.2021.103308;SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) coronavirus has been causing enormous suffering, death, and economic losses worldwide. There are rigorous containment measures on industries, non-essential business, transportation, and citizen mobility to check the spread. The lockdowns may have an advantageous impact on reducing the atmospheric pollutants. This study has analyzed the change in atmospheric pollutants, based on the Sentinel–5Ps and ground-station observed data during partial to complete lockdown period in 2020. Results revealed that the mean tropospheric NO(2) concentration substantially dropped in 2020 due to lockdown against the same period in 2019 by 18–40% over the major urban areas located in Europe (i.e. Madrid, Milan, Paris) and the USA (i.e. New York, Boston, and Springfield). Conversely, urban areas with partial to no lockdown measures (i.e. Warsaw, Pierre, Bismarck, and Lincoln) exhibited a relatively lower dropdown in mean NO(2) concentration (3 to 7.5%). The role of meteorological variability was found to be negligible. Nevertheless, the reduced levels of atmospheric pollutants were primarily attributed to the shutdown of vehicles, power plants, and industrial emissions. Improvement in air quality during COVID-19 may be temporary, but regulatory bodies should learn to reduce air pollution on a long-term basis concerning the trade-offs between the environment, society, and economic growth. The intersection of urban design, health, and environment should be addressed by policy-makers to protect public health and sustainable urban policies could be adopted to build urban resilience against any future emergencies.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127873/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275121002080?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264275121002080; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2021.103308";10/06/2021;SARS CoV-2;0.9763
495;An impact of national lockdown towards emergency department visits and admission rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand: A hospital-based study.;10.1111/1742-6723.13666;OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of the national lockdown due to the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic towards the Emergency Department (ED) visits and admission rates in Thailand. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical database of patients presenting to the ED during the national lockdown period (26 March to 30 June 2020). We used the same time interval in the year 2019 as the control period in our analysis. We collected baseline characteristics and outcomes of each patient in the ED. The primary outcome was the incidence rate ratio (IRR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the average daily ED visits. Secondary outcomes included the IRR with 95% CI of total admissions and ICU admissions. RESULTS The average number of daily ED visits decreased significantly from 89.1 to 57.0 (-36.0%, IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.70). However, the proportions of 'Resuscitation' and 'Emergency' triage level were increased (29.1% vs. 19.2%, p < 0.001). Total ED admission rate and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate were also increased (33.5% vs. 28.3%, p < 0.001 and 10.2% vs. 7.5%, p < 0.001, respectively). The IRR for the admission rate was 1.18 (95% CI 1.11-1.26), and the IRR for the ICU admission rate was 1.35 (95% CI 1.21-1.52). CONCLUSION The national lockdown in Thailand was associated with a significant reduction in average daily ED visits across traumatic and non-traumatic patients. Communication from healthcare professionals and public health officers is necessary to reinforce the importance of timely ED visits for acute health conditions. This article is protected by  .

This is one reason why it is very important to assess all barriers to end-of-life care and to provide safe and quality services to patients. This study was aimed at describing nurses' attitudes in providing end-of-life care and exploring barriers and facilitating behaviors of nurses in multi-profile hospitals in Eastern Europe. METHODS A descriptive, correlational design was applied in this study, using a cross-sectional survey of 1320 registered nurses within 7 hospitals in Lithuania. RESULTS Registered nurses working in the three different profiles emphasized safe and effective care and the importance of meeting the patient's spiritual needs at the end of life. The main barriers assigned by nurses caring for patients at the end of life were angry family members, inadequate understanding of nursing care by the patient's relatives; lack of time to talk to patients, lack of nursing knowledge to deal with the bereaved patient's family, lack of evaluation of nurses' opinions, and the evasion by physicians to talk about the diagnosis and their over-optimistic view of the situation. The main facilitating behaviors to improve nursing care were end-of-life training, volunteering, and family involvement. CONCLUSIONS Spiritual needs were identified by nurses as the primary needs of patients at the end of life. Family-related barriers remain one of the main barriers to end-of-life care. Also, the behavior of physicians and their relationship with nurses remains one of the most sensitive issues in end-of-life care.";"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-020-00637-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814574/";19/08/2020;End-of-life care;0.9479
497;Cutaneous manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection: a clinical update;10.1111/jdv.16774;On March 11(th), 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) a global pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2 virus). A consistent number of case reports and clinical series have been already published describing a complex spectrum of skin manifestations associated with the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We carried out a review of the English‐language literature up to May 20th 2020, reporting original cases or case series of the cutaneous manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 virus infection. The following databases were consulted PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, ResearchGate. The search of papers was conducted by using the key term ‘COVID‐19’ or ‘SARS‐CoV‐2’ or ‘coronavirus’ combined with each of the following: ‘skin’, ‘cutaneous’, ’dermatologic’ or ‘dermatology’, ‘manifestation’, ‘lesions,’ or ‘rash.’ The patterns of dermatological manifestations associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection could be classified into four categories: exanthema (varicella‐like, papulo‐vesicular and morbilliform rash), vascular (chilblain‐like, purpuric/petechial and livedoid lesions), urticarial and acro‐papular eruption. Lastly, other skin manifestations to be considered are the cutaneous adverse reactions to the drugs prescribed for the treatment of COVID‐19. Whether SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can directly cause a worsening of chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis remains to be determined.

498;Dexmedetomidine suppresses oxidative stress and inflammation of nucleus pulposus cells by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.;10.1691/ph.2020.9927;Objective: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is very common in the elderly, so it is particularly important to find appropriate prevention or treatment. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on the degeneration of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and its mechanism. Methods: We established a mouse model of IVDD and cultured mouse NP cells and treated them with IL-1β and DEX. The effect of DEX on NP cells was determined by detecting the extracellular matrix of NP cells, changes in ROS levels and inflammatory mediators. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, is used to inhibit the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The effect of DEX on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was determined by studying the effects of DEX on PI3K/ Akt signaling pathway-related molecules and the effect of LY294002 on NP cells degeneration. DEX significantly increased the disc height index and attenuated IVDD in mice. Results: DEX significantly inhibited the expression of MMP3/9 in NP cells, effectively inhibiting the degradation of extracellular matrix. In addition, oxidative stress levels and inflammatory levels in NP cells are also attenuated by DEX. The expression of PI3K, Akt and p-Akt was significantly increased in DEX-stimulated NP cells, indicating that DEX increased the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. DEX promotes PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, inhibits oxidative stress and inflammatory of NP cells, thereby slowing the degeneration of NP cells. Conclusion: DEX promotes PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, inhibits oxidative stress and inflammatory of NP cells, thereby slowing the degeneration of NP cells.;"https://doi.org/10.1691/ph.2020.9927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305726/";01/10/2020;Intervertebral disc degeneration;0.934

Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of published liver manifestations and described the liver damage in COVID-19 patients with death or survival. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, Cochrane Library, Embase, and three Chinese electronic databases through April 22, 2020. We analyzed pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by the main clinical outcome of COVID-19 using a fixed or random-effects model. Results: In the meta-analysis of 18 studies, which included a total of 2,862 patients, the pooled mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 30.9 IU/L in the COVID-19 patients with death and 26.3 IU/L in the COVID-19 patients discharged alive (p < 0.0001). The pooled mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 45.3 IU/L in the COVID-19 patients with death while 30.1 IU/L in the patients discharged alive (p < 0.0001). Compared with the discharged alive cases, the dead cases tended to have lower albumin levels but longer prothrombin time, and international standardized ratio. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, according to the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, we comprehensively described three patterns of liver impairment related to COVID-19, hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and hepatocellular disfunction.

501;Entrepreneurial educators: vital enablers to support the education sector to reimagine and respond to the challenges of COVID-19;10.1007/s41959-020-00034-4;This article examines the experiences of the educator as a key actor in entrepreneurship education. Since the 1990s, the education sector has been called upon to create more ‘entrepreneurs’ to find solutions to global problems leading to entrepreneurship education. The educator is a key participant in the process of entrepreneurship education, but too little is known or understood about their experiences. Employing an interpretative phenomenological approach with ten UK-based higher education entrepreneurship education educators, this article sheds light on their experiences. The article concludes by proposing a conceptual model of the essence of entrepreneurship education educators’ experiences which identifies shared values, multiple identities and innovative practices. It finds something personal and inherently ‘good’ about entrepreneurship education, beyond the knowledge of entrepreneurship, which attracts certain educators. These educators are found to be entrepreneurial with a need for change, distinctiveness and action which at times can lead to marginalisation from the traditional educational establishment. They are found to be highly efficacious entrepreneurial employees (Lackéus et al., Bacigalupo (ed) The entrepreneurial employee in the public and private sector—what, why, how. Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg, 2020) and, it is argued, could act as significant enablers for wider educational systems change required to respond to the challenges of COVID-19 (WHO in Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, 2020. https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520512/;28/09/2020;WHO in Coronavirus disease;0.9783

In the pediatric population, coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 has a reported mortality of less than 6% in complicated cases; however, the clinical characteristics and severity are not the same as those presented in the adult population. This study aimed to describe the clinical manifestations of patients younger than 18 years old and their association with the confirmation of the test and outcomes. Methods We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study of symptoms suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All subjects with a confirmatory test for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Initial symptoms, history of influenza vaccination, and previous contact were documented, and mortality and the requirement for assisted mechanical ventilation were identified. The proportions of the variables were compared with the χ2 test. The odds ratio for a positive test and the requirement of intubation was calculated. Results Of a total of 510 subjects, 76 (15%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The associated symptoms were chest pain, sudden onset of symptoms, and general malaise. The variable most associated with contagion was the exposure to a relative with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Infants and subjects without the influenza vaccine showed an increased risk for respiratory complications.

504;An Integrative Review on Factors Contributing to Fear of Cancer Recurrence Among Young Adult Breast Cancer Survivors.;10.1097/ncc.0000000000000858;BACKGROUND Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is the most prevalent need among breast cancer survivors. Age is the most consistent predictor of higher FCR, with prevalence rates as high as 70% among young adults. Although the association between age and higher FCR is well established, a more comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to higher FCR among young adult breast cancer survivors is needed. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this integrative review was to explore the factors associated with higher FCR among young adult breast cancer survivors (≤ 45 years old). METHODS A literature search was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases with specific Medical Subject Headings terms delimited to FCR, diagnosis, sex, and age range. The initial search yielded 378 studies, 13 of which met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS Themes include motherhood status, health behaviors and decision making (eg, surveillance behaviors and surgical decision making), psychological morbidity, and social support. Cognitive behavioral factors include cognitive processing, metacognition, illness intrusiveness, and self-efficacy. CONCLUSION Fear of cancer recurrence among young adult breast cancer survivors is a unique construct requiring further exploration and tailored interventions to improve the health-related quality of life for this population. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Oncology nurses should screen all cancer survivors for FCR, with particular attention to the unique needs of young adults. Future research should address the role of age-appropriate support and increased levels of FCR during surveillance periods.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/ncc.0000000000000858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657897/";10/07/2020;Fear of cancer recurrence;0.9466
505;Characterization of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant that emerged in Brazil.;10.1073/pnas.2106535118;The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) plays a key role in viral infectivity. It is also the major antigen stimulating the host's protective immune response, specifically, the production of neutralizing antibodies. Recently, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 possessing multiple mutations in the S protein, designated P.1, emerged in Brazil. Here, we characterized a P.1 variant isolated in Japan by using Syrian hamsters, a well-established small animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). In hamsters, the variant showed replicative abilities and pathogenicity similar to those of early and contemporary strains (i.e., SARS-CoV-2 bearing aspartic acid [D] or glycine [G] at position 614 of the S protein). Sera and/or plasma from convalescent patients and BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccinees showed comparable neutralization titers across the P.1 variant, S-614D, and S-614G strains. In contrast, the S-614D and S-614G strains were less well recognized than the P.1 variant by serum from a P.1-infected patient. Prior infection with S-614D or S-614G strains efficiently prevented the replication of the P.1 variant in the lower respiratory tract of hamsters upon reinfection. In addition, passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies to hamsters infected with the P.1 variant or the S-614G strain led to reduced virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. However, the effect was less pronounced against the P.1 variant than the S-614G strain. These findings suggest that the P.1 variant may be somewhat antigenically different from the early and contemporary strains of SARS-CoV-2.;"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2106535118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140350/";06/07/2021;SARS-CoV-2 disease;0.9347
506;Impact of Personal Protective Equipment on the Performance of Emergency Pediatric Procedures by Prehospital Providers;10.1017/dmp.2020.128;"BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn by prehospital providers (PHPs) for protection from hazardous exposures. Evidence regarding the ability of PHPs to perform resuscitation procedures has been described in adult but not pediatric models. This study examined the effects of PPE on the ability of PHPs to perform resuscitation procedures on pediatric patients. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at a US simulation center. Paramedics wore normal attire at the baseline session and donned full Level B PPE for the second session. During each session, they performed timed sets of psychomotor tasks simulating clinical care of a critically ill pediatric patient. The difference in time to completion between baseline and PPE sessions per task was examined using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: A total of 50 paramedics completed both sessions. Median times for task completion at the PPE sessions increased significantly from baseline for several procedures: tracheal intubation (+4.5 s; P = 0.01), automated external defibrillator (AED) placement (+9.5 s; P = 0.01), intraosseous line insertion (+7 s; P < 0.0001), tourniquet (+8.5 s; P < 0.0001), intramuscular injection (+21-23 s, P < 0.0001), and pulse oximetry (+4 s; P < 0.0001). There was no significant increase in completion time for bag-mask ventilation or autoinjector use.

SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes. CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in the lysosomes). We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is amantadine (10uM). Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinson's disease. It is available as a generic drug. Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence, interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092485792030162X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S092485792030162X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361028/";30/04/2020;SARS-coronavirus 2;0.9098
508;Financial Insecurity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Spillover Effects on Burnout–Disengagement Relationships and Performance of Employees Who Moonlight;10.3389/fpsyg.2021.610138;The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has magnified the issue of financial insecurity. However, its effect on individual-organizational relations and, consequently, on organizational performance remains understudied. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the spillover effect of financial insecurity on the burnout–disengagement relationship during the pandemic. The authors investigate in particular whether the spillover effect influences the performance of moonlighting employees and also explore the mediating effect of disengagement on the relationship between financial insecurity and burnout interaction effect and the performance (i.e., mediated-moderation). This study collected responses from 162 public and private sector employees who are engaged in moonlighting activities in Malaysia. The results from the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) revealed greater levels of financial insecurity and burnout associated with greater levels of work disengagement. The analysis of the interaction-moderation effect showed that when financial insecurity rises, the burnout effect on work disengagement increases among moonlighters. Using the PROCESS macro model, the results displayed burnout as a predictor of extra-role performance via a moderated (financial insecurity) mediation (work disengagement) relationship. Going forward, this study not only opens new avenues for research into the financial consequences of COVID-19 but also calls on managers to take proactive steps to mitigate the negative effect of the pandemic on the performance of moonlighting employees to keep them in the profession.;"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.610138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679526/";18/02/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9672
509;Health Care Workers’ Reasons for Choosing Between Two Different COVID-19 Prophylaxis Trials in an Acute Pandemic Context: Single-Center Questionnaire Study;10.2196/23441;BACKGROUND: In April 2020, two independent clinical trials to assess SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis strategies among health care workers were initiated at our hospital: MeCOVID (melatonin vs placebo) and EPICOS (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine vs hydroxychloroquine vs combination therapy vs placebo). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the reasons why health care workers chose to participate in the MeCOVID and EPICOS trials, as well as why they chose one over the other. METHODS: Both trials were offered to health care workers through an internal news bulletin. After an initial screening visit, all subjects were asked to respond to a web-based survey. RESULTS: In the first month, 206 health care workers were screened and 160 were randomized. The survey participation was high at 73.3%. Health care workers cited “to contribute to scientific knowledge” (n=80, 53.0%), followed by “to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection” (n=33, 21.9%) and “the interest to be tested for SARS-CoV-2” (n=28, 18.5%), as their primary reasons to participate in the trials. We observed significant differences in the expected personal benefits across physicians and nurses (P=.01). The vast majority of volunteers (n=202, 98.0%) selected the MeCOVID trial, their primary reason being their concern regarding adverse reactions to treatments in the EPICOS trial (n=102, 69.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers’ reasons to participate in prophylaxis trials in an acute pandemic context appear to be driven largely by their desire to contribute to science and to gain health benefits. Safety outweighed efficacy when choosing between the two clinical trials.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33556032/; https://doi.org/10.2196/23441";25/02/2021;melatonin vs placebo;0.9639

Capable de prévenir une maladie, la COVID-19, il devrait donc être commercialisé sous un statut de médicament. Si l’on considère l’histoire du savon, on se rend compte de la complexité de son statut. Selon les périodes, il a été considéré comme un produit d’hygiène et/ou comme un excipient ou encore comme une substance active, permettant la réalisation de médicaments ou de cosmétiques destinés à traiter aussi bien la gale que les brûlures, de réaliser des purges ou de mettre au point des préparations pour adoucir ou blanchir les mains ou pour allonger les cils. L’emploi du terme « savon » étant extrêmement galvaudé, l’établissement d’une réglementation visant à clarifier cette situation s’imposerait. Soap is a cosmetic product in common use during this pandemic period. It enables barrier gestures to be carried out. Capable of preventing pathology (COVID-19), it should, therefore, be marketed under a drug status. If we consider the history of soap, we realize the complexity of its status. Depending on the period, it has been considered as a hygiene product and/or as an excipient or an active ingredient allowing the production of a drug or cosmetic making it possible to treat both scabies and burns, to carry out purges or to put at the point of preparations to soften or whiten hands or to lengthen eyelashes.

511;Ethical Framework for Nutrition Support Resource Allocation During Shortages: Lessons From COVID‐19;10.1002/ncp.10500;The coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic has impacted all aspects of our population. The “Troubling Trichotomy” of what can be done technologically, what should be done ethically, and what must be done legally is a reality during these unusual circumstances. Recent ethical considerations regarding allocation of scarce resources, such as mechanical ventilators, have been proposed. These can apply to other disciplines such as nutrition support, although decisions regarding nutrition support have a diminished potential for devastating outcomes. The principal values and goals leading to an ethical framework for a uniform, fair, and objective approach are reviewed in this article, with a focus on nutrition support. Some historical aspects of shortages in nutrition supplies and products during normal circumstances, as well as others during national crises, are outlined. The development and implementation of protocols using a scoring system seems best addressed by multidisciplinary ethics and triage committees with synergistic but disparate functions. Triage committees should alleviate the burdens of unilateral decisions by the healthcare team caring for patients. The treating team should make every attempt to have patients and the public at large update or execute/develop advance directives. Legal considerations, as the third component of the Troubling Trichotomy, are of some concern when rationing care. The likelihood that criminal or civil charges could be brought against individual healthcare professionals or institutions can be minimized, if fair protocols are uniformly applied and deliberations well documented.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/ncp.10500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32492759/";03/06/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9081
512;Evaluation of Microwave Vacuum Drying as an Alternative to Freeze-Drying of Biologics and Vaccines: the Power of Simple Modeling to Identify a Mechanism for Faster Drying Times Achieved with Microwave;10.1208/s12249-020-01912-9;Vial-based lyophilization for biopharmaceuticals has been an indispensable cornerstone process for over 50 years. However, the process is not without significant challenges. Capital costs to realize a lyophilized drug product facility, for example, are very high. Similarly, heat and mass transfer limitations inherent in lyophilization result in drying cycle on the order of several days while putting practical constraints on available formulation space, such as solute mass percentage or fill volume in a vial. Through collaboration with an external partner, we are exploring microwave vacuum drying (MVD) as a faster drying process to vial lyophilization wherein the heat transfer process occurs by microwave radiation instead of pure conduction from the vial. Drying using this radiative process demonstrates greater than 80% reduction in drying time over traditional freeze-drying times while maintaining product activity and stability. Such reduction in freeze-drying process times from days to several hours is a welcome change as it enables flexible manufacturing by being able to better react to changes either in terms of product volume for on-demand manufacturing scenarios or facilities for production (e.g., scale-out over scale-up). Additionally, by utilizing first-principle modeling coupled with experimental verification, a mechanism for faster drying times associated with MVD is proposed in this article. This research, to the best of our knowledge, forms the very first report of utilizing microwave vacuum drying for vaccines while utilizing the power of simplified models to understand drying principles associated with MVD.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814865/;19/01/2021;microwave vacuum drying;0.9236
513;Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on sleep duration in children and adolescents: A survey across different continents.;10.1002/ppul.25367;"BACKGROUND A parent survey was conducted to assess the sleep habits of children residing in various countries before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It was hypothesized that lockdown would be associated with increased sleep duration. METHODS Outcomes were changes in bedtime, wake time, and sleep duration in the pandemic compared to before. Logistic regression was applied to evaluate the effects of age and covariates on outcomes. RESULTS A total of 845 questionnaires completed from May 1 to June 10, 2020 were analyzed (45.8% female; age 3-17 years). During the pandemic, 23.1% of preschoolers, 46.2% of school-age children, and 89.8% of adolescents were going to bed after 10 p.m. on weekdays compared to 7.1%, 9.4%, and 57.1% respectively before the pandemic, with these proportions being higher on weekends. Likewise, 42.5% of preschoolers, 61.3% of school-age children, and 81.2% of adolescents were waking after 8 a.m. on weekdays (11.6%, 4.9%, and 10.3%, before) with these proportions being greater on weekends. Sleep duration did not change in 43% of participants on weekdays and in 46.2% on weekends. The 14-17 years group had fourfold increased odds for longer sleep duration on weekdays (p < .01), and children aged 6-13 years had twofold increased odds for longer sleep duration on weekends relative to the 3-5 years age group (p = .01). CONCLUSIONS Although lockdown was associated with later bedtime and wake time, this shift did not alter sleep duration in more than 40% of children. Yet, compared to preschoolers, high school-aged children were more likely to sleep more on weekdays and primary school children on weekends.";"https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33887116/";22/04/2021;CONCLUSIONS;0.9808
514;COVID-19 impact on employee flourishing: Parental stress as mediator.;10.1037/tra0001037;Objectives: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has adversely affected the global community's economic, social, emotional, and physical well-being. Although prior research works have rigorously explored the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health, investigations linking the impact of COVID-19 with parental stress and flourishing are very scarce. Rooted in boundary theory, the authors examined the influence of COVID-19 on flourishing and parental stress, respectively. Furthermore, predicated on spillover theory, the study explored the mediating effect of parental stress. Method: In this research, 259 IT employees in India were prospectively followed from the second week until the twentieth week of lockdown as part of a longitudinal population. A three-stage data collection method was employed. The employee completed the COVID-19 impact scale in the 2nd and 10th week of lockdown in India. Subsequently, the authors administered parental stress and flourishing surveys online in the 20th week. Results: Findings revealed that COVID-19 negatively impacted employee flourishing, via parental stress that had a partial mediating effect. Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind to theoretically and empirically investigate the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on employees' flourishing via parental stress. Based on the findings, the organizations can enhance their employees' flourishing by providing the autonomy to control their work time, and adequate training to better handle COVID-19 impact and parental stress to have better and sustainable human resources.

515;Nonmissile penetrating spinal injuries: Mechanisms, expectations, and management;10.25259/sni_596_2020;BACKGROUND: Nonmissile penetrating spinal injury (NMPSI) is an uncommon form of traumatic injury to the spine. Here, we present a comprehensive and contemporary literature review that provides insight into NMPSI-type injuries, their mechanisms, clinical practice, management, and expectations. METHODS: An extensive review of the published literature was conducted in PubMed, OVID Medline, and EMBASE journals for studies of nonmissile penetrating spine injuries. Terms for search included NMPSI and nonmissile penetrating spinal cord injury. No date restrictions were used. RESULTS: The search yielded only 17 related articles. Cross-checking of articles was conducted to exclude duplicate articles. The 17 articles were screened for their full text and English language availability. We finalized those articles pertaining to the topic. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of injury in NMPSI occurs in two different stages. Immediate injury is caused by direct damage to the neurological structures. The delayed injury response is caused by damage to the spinal vasculature and activated immune response pathways. Computed tomography (CT) angiograms or formal diagnostic angiograms are indicated to identify vascular injury or development of pseudoaneurysm and can be performed both preoperatively and postoperatively. Surgically, decompressive procedures include laminectomies and hemilaminectomies. Dural exploration may be indicated if a cerebrospinal fluid leak with fistula develops from dural puncture. Further research and technologies are being developed to provide patients who have suffered NMPSI with more resources for a better quality of life.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7749954/;25/11/2020;Nonmissile penetrating spinal injury;0.9536
516;Compliance and attitudes of blood donors following transitioning from permanent to 12-month deferral of men who have sex with men in Hong Kong.;10.1111/vox.13025;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Blood safety hinges not just on the scientific rationale for deferral period but potential donors' compliance with the prevailing policy. This study aimed to investigate donors' awareness, attitudes and compliance with the two-phased policy implementation of time-limited deferral for men who have sex with men (MSM) in Hong Kong. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three rounds of questionnaire survey were conducted between July 2017 and June 2019 covering the periods of pre-implementation (Round A), post-implementation without and with pre-donation questionnaire revision (Round B and C). Chi-square test and multivariable regression analysis were performed. RESULTS Of 3085 donors recruited, 968, 1036 and 1081 completed the surveys in Round A, B and C, respectively. The non-compliance rate of MSM remained stable at 0·6% (3/497), 0·4% (2/551) and 0·5% (3/587) among male donors in Round A, B and C, respectively. Two MSM donors from Round C complying with the prevailing policy were identified. About two-thirds (60·7%) of respondents from Round B and C were unaware of the policy change. Overall, over 80% were either neutral or positive about the change. CONCLUSION Our study showed a consistently low non-compliance rate of MSM over the three periods. The generally high level of acceptance of time-limited deferral among donors lends support to science-based policy development to protect blood safety. The identification of compliant MSM donors suggests that the 12-month deferral is effective and acceptable to MSM. With a deferral period far exceeding the window period, it is a step towards a more equitable policy.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.13025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196117/";16/11/2020;Blood safety;0.942
517;Food Insecurity in Tribal High Migration Communities in Rajasthan, India.;10.1177/0379572120967163;BACKGROUND The COVID pandemic and subsequent lockdown has disrupted food supplies across large parts of India, where even prior to the pandemic, food insecurity and malnutrition were widely prevalent. Tribal populations in southern Rajasthan, India, live in extreme scarcity, rely mainly on outward migration for sustenance, and have been significantly affected by the pandemic. In this study, we assess the availability of foodstuffs at the household level and community experiences about satiety and hunger during lockdown. METHODOLOGY We conducted a rapid assessment of food security in rural southern Rajasthan, India, using a structured questionnaire. Trained interviewers conducted telephonic interviews using KoBoToolbox, an open-source tool. A total of 211 respondents including community volunteers, family members of tuberculosis patients and malnourished children, pregnant women, and influential members in the villages participated in the study. RESULTS A cereal was reported to be present by 97% of the respondents, two-thirds had pulses, and nearly half had milk. The amount of cereals available was adequate for about 5 months and that of pulses, oil/ ghee, and sugar for about 1 to 2 weeks. Two-thirds of the respondents reported that food in their households was sometimes not sufficient for the amount they wanted to eat, and 97% of these mentioned not having money to buy food as the reason for not having sufficient food. CONCLUSION The study highlights widespread food insecurity among tribal communities in southern Rajasthan, and the scenario is likely to be similar in other tribal migration dependent areas of the country.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/0379572120967163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33143470/";04/11/2020;BACKGROUND;0.9552
518;Analysis of coagulation parameters in patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China.;10.5582/bst.2020.03086;To investigate the characteristic of coagulation function in 303 patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we evaluated the correlation between coagulation function and disease status. We retrospectively analyzed 303 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and evaluated the clinical data of 240 patients who were discharged. The coagulation function of the two groups (mild and severe) was compared. Compared with the mild group, majority of patients in the severe group were male (76.9% vs. 49.8%) and elderly (median age 65 vs. 50), and the proportion with chronic underlying diseases was higher (73.1% vs. 36.1%). There were 209 abnormalities (69.0%) of coagulation parameters in 303 patients admitted to hospital. Comparison of various indexes of coagulation function between the two groups in admission, the proportion of abnormal coagulation indicators in the severe group was higher than that in the mild group (100% vs. 66.1%). The median coagulation parameters in the severe group were higher than those in the mild group: international normalized ratio (1.04 vs. 1.01), prothrombin time (13.8 vs. 13.4) seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (43.2 vs. 39.2) seconds, fibrinogen (4.74 vs. 4.33) g/L, fibrinogen degradation products (2.61 vs. 0.99) µg/mL, and D-dimer (1.04 vs. 0.43) µg/mL, the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Coagulation dysfunction is common in patients with COVID-19, especially fibrinogen and D-dimer elevation, and the degree of elevation is related to the severity of the disease. As the disease recovers, fibrinogen and activated partial thromboplastin time also return to normal.;"https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.03086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350161/";30/04/2020;Coagulation dysfunction;0.9642
519;Medicare Expenditures for Conventional and Biologic Disease Modifying Agents Commonly Used for Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis;10.1016/j.semarthrit.2020.08.002;"BACKGROUND: Biologic disease modifying agents (bDMARDs) are an integral part of rheumatoid arthritis treatment guidelines but are associated with significant cost in the US. We present the trends in total spending and unit cost of conventional DMARDs (cDMARDs) as compared to bDMARDs in Medicare program. METHODS: We used the Medicare drug spending data for the year 2012-2017 covering all part B (fee-for-service) and part D drugs. Total spending was calculated by summing spending across various drug formulations and unit drug cost by dividing total spending by number of doses dispensed. We present the 6-year trends in total spending, total beneficiary count and unit costs of each of the commonly used cDMARDs and bDMARDs. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2017, the total spending on the cDMARDs increased 5-folds from $98 million to $579 million; this was fraction of total spending on bDMARDs which increased from $4.3 to $10.0 billion. This increase was driven largely by unit costs of drug rather than number of beneficiaries. There was a 6-fold increase in the unit cost of generic hydroxychloroquine followed by methotrexate and leflunomide. Amongst bDMARDs, adalimumab and etanercept unit cost increased by 2-folds. The increase was less pronounced for office-administered products. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of several generic cDMARDs over decades, there were steep increases in the unit cost of these agents to “keep pace” with the increases in bDMARDs. As the number of elderly rheumatoid arthritis patients increases, policy interventions might be required to reduce the spending on both biologics and conventional DMARDs.";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049017220302225?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semarthrit.2020.08.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049017220302225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32896694/";28/08/2020;Biologic disease modifying agents;0.9774
520;A digital protein microarray for COVID-19 cytokine storm monitoring.;10.1039/d0lc00678e;Despite widespread concern regarding cytokine storms leading to severe morbidity in COVID-19, rapid cytokine assays are not routinely available for monitoring critically ill patients. We report the clinical application of a digital protein microarray platform for rapid multiplex quantification of cytokines from critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the University of Michigan Hospital. The platform comprises two low-cost modules: (i) a semi-automated fluidic dispensing/mixing module that can be operated inside a biosafety cabinet to minimize the exposure of the technician to the virus infection and (ii) a 12-12-15 inch compact fluorescence optical scanner for the potential near-bedside readout. The platform enabled daily cytokine analysis in clinical practice with high sensitivity (<0.4 pg mL-1), inter-assay repeatability (∼10% CV), and rapid operation providing feedback on the progress of therapy within 4 hours. This test allowed us to perform serial monitoring of two critically ill patients with respiratory failure and to support immunomodulatory therapy using the selective cytopheretic device (SCD). We also observed clear interleukin-6 (IL-6) elevations after receiving tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) while significant cytokine profile variability exists across all critically ill COVID-19 patients and to discover a weak correlation between IL-6 to clinical biomarkers, such as ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP). Our data revealed large subject-to-subject variability in patients' response to COVID-19, reaffirming the need for a personalized strategy guided by rapid cytokine assays.;"https://doi.org/10.1039/d0lc00678e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211045/";19/11/2020;selective cytopheretic device;0.9092

We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 U.S. patients with COVID-19. Methods: We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by CDC during January 20-February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from 7/10 patients. Conclusions: In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long.

522;Differential COVID‐19 case positivity in New York City neighborhoods: Socioeconomic factors and mobility;10.1111/irv.12816;"BACKGROUND: New York City (NYC) has been one of the hotspots of the COVID‐19 pandemic in the United States. By the end of April 2020, close to 165 000 cases and 13 000 deaths were reported in the city with considerable variability across the city's ZIP codes. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examine: (a) the extent to which the variability in ZIP code‐level case positivity can be explained by aggregate markers of socioeconomic status (SES) and daily change in mobility; and (b) the extent to which daily change in mobility independently predicts case positivity. METHODS: COVID‐19 case positivity by ZIP code was modeled using multivariable linear regression with generalized estimating equations to account for within‐ZIP clustering. Daily case positivity was obtained from NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and measures of SES were based on data from the American Community Survey. Changes in human mobility were estimated using anonymized aggregated mobile phone location systems. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that the socioeconomic markers considered together explained 56% of the variability in case positivity through April 1 and their explanatory power decreased to 18% by April 30. Changes in mobility during this time period are not likely to be acting as a mediator of the relationship between ZIP‐level SES and case positivity. During the middle of April, increases in mobility were independently associated with decreased case positivity.

RESULTADOS: Em comparação com o mesmo período de 2019, houve um decréscimo de 15% na taxa de IH e de 9% no total de OH por DCV entre março e maio de 2020, acompanhado de um aumento de 9% na taxa de LH por esse grupo de doenças, sobretudo entre pacientes com idade de 20-59 anos. As taxas de IH e LH registradas em 2020 diferiram significativamente da tendência projetada para o corrente ano (p=0,0005 e 0,0318, respectivamente). CONCLUSÕES: Durante os primeiros meses da pandemia, observou-se um declínio na IH associado a um aumento da LH por DCV no Brasil. Esses dados possivelmente são consequência do planejamento inadequado no manejo das DCV durante a pandemia, sendo necessária a implementação de ações imediatas para modificar esse cenário.

524;Nurse navigators’ telemonitoring for cancer patients with COVID-19: a French case study;10.1007/s00520-020-05968-y;"PURPOSE: The Gustave Roussy Cancer Institute implemented a patient-reported outcome platform (CAPRI-COVID) for cancer patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to quarantine patients at home while ensuring monitoring of COVID-related symptoms and securing the care pathway. In this study, we described the CAPRI-COVID intervention, evaluated its use, and presented results of the tracking indicators with a focus on the nurse navigators’ (NNs) activities and the experience of patients. METHODS: Data of 130 cancer patients with COVID-19 diagnosed from March 23 to June 5, 2020, were collected. Six COVID-related symptoms were monitored daily, either by the patient via the CAPRI mobile application (CAPRI App) or by NNs via telemonitoring. In the cases of worsening or new-onset symptoms, an automated alert was sent to the platform, and NNs could immediately consult an emergency physician for future course of action. RESULTS: All 130 patients (median age: 59 years; 59.2% female) were monitored during the study period. There were no deaths or admissions to the intensive care unit attributable to COVID-19; 7.8% of patients were hospitalized (excluding scheduled hospitalization), and 17.1% were admitted to the emergency department at least once during the monitoring period. NNs carried out 1412 regular monitoring calls (average of 10.9 calls per patient), while 55% of the patients downloaded the CAPRI App. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients monitored with CAPRI-COVID were quarantined during the first wave of the pandemic. In addition to the CAPRI App, which helped limit phone calls, NNs played an essential role in patient management.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33462724/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05968-y";18/01/2021;patient-reported outcome platform;0.9455
525;Impact of containment and mitigation measures on children and youth with SD during the COVID-19 pandemic: Report from the ELENA cohort;10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.041;"BACKGROUND: Containment, involving separation and restriction of movement of people due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and mitigation, also referred to as lockdown, involving closure of schools, universities and public venues, has had a profound impact on people's lives globally. The study focuses on the effects of containment and mitigation measures, on the behavior of children and youth (CaY) with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The study primary aim was to examine the impact of these urgent measures on the behaviors, communication, sleep, and nutritional status of the CaY. A secondary aim was to explore risk and protective factors on behavior change including sociodemographic variables, living conditions, ASD symptom severity and continuity of interventions. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 239 ASD subjects, 2–21 years of age, enrolled in the ELENA cohort in France at Stage 3 confinement and mitigation measures announced on March 16, 2020. A parent informant completed the COVID-19 questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the domains examined, challenging behaviors, communicative skills and sleep had the greatest impact; in terms of risk and protective factors, subject age, ASD severity, single parenthood, daily living skills, and intervention continuity were most likely to impact behaviors; living conditions were not linked to behavior change.

526;The management of psychosocial risks at work: state of the art and future perspectives;10.23749/mdl.v111i5.10679;BACKGROUND: Psychosocial risk management represents a current challenge in Occupational Health and Safety (OSH) due to their impacts of such risks on work stress and the rapid changes of the world of work. An effective psychosocial risk management can be carried out on the basis of an integrated multidisciplinary model founded on the risk management paradigm. Over years, the occupational medicine has played an important role at national level in this area, contributing to the creation of an integrated and participatory approach. OBJECTIVES: This study explores the developmental process of psychosocial risk management over time in Europe and Italy, to offer an update on the state of the art at a national level and insights on future perspectives. METHODS: Through a reflection on research developments, in Europe and in Italy, we outline how the knowledge obtained has been translated into policies, which have encouraged the implementation at international and national level of consolidated practices for the management of psychosocial risks. RESULTS: An overview of some key steps of the inclusion of psychosocial aspects in OSH is presented, highlighting the positive impact of the multidisciplinary approach. Moreover, the driving role played by policies for implementation in organizational practice is also highlighted, with particular reference to the Italian example. DISCUSSION: Starting from the existing knowledge, it is necessary to tackle emerging risks by continuing to translate the knowledge obtained from research into policies that have a driving role in the identification and implementation of actions and practical tools.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809977/;31/10/2020;Psychosocial risk management;0.9106
527;Urticaria and COVID-19: a review.;10.1111/dth.14290;"The first cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Cutaneous manifestations are among the heterogenous clinical features of the disease, and urticaria is one of the most common skin manifestations reported in COVID-19. We reviewed the literature available regarding COVID-19-associated urticaria. A literature search in the PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted, till the cut-off date of 24th July 2020, using the following terms: ""skin"" or ""cutaneous"" or ""urticaria"" or ""urticarial,"" and ""COVID-19"" or coronavirus disease. The search resulted in 502 publications. In this review, 30 articles with a total of 202 patients with COVID-19-associated urticaria were included. Patient age ranged from 2 months to 84 years. Gender was reported in 149 patients; of these 96 (64%) were females, and 53 (36%) were males. Of the 105 patients with a determined onset of the disease, 58 (55%) presented with rash preceding or concurrently with the classic COVID-19 symptoms. Urticarial rash was mainly either generalized or distributed on the trunk. Associated respiratory symptoms, level of care, medications used, comorbidities, and duration, and distribution and timeline of urticarial rash were summarized. In this article, we present a review of literature on COVID-19-associated urticaria, which would enable dermatologists and other clinicians to diagnose COVID-19 early in the onset of disease, and prevent viral spread.

Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted during the month of March 2020 to the nonintensive COVID unit of Udine University Hospital on the basis of a positive swab test and/or of clinical-radiologic signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, and results expressed as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Of 141 patients admitted, 93 were interviewed. Hyposmia and dysgeusia were present in 58 cases (62.4%). In 22.4% of them, olfactory and gustatory impairment clearly preceded systemic symptoms. The presence of active smoking was very limited in both groups: 8.6% in hyposmic vs 2.9% in normosmic patients (odds ratio 3.2; 95% CI 0.3-28.6). Moreover, total leukocytes and neutrophils count were respectively 23% (effect estimate 1.23; 95% CI 1.06-1.42) and 29% (effect estimate 1.29; 95% CI 1.07-1.54) lower in the hyposmic cohort. No difference was found for other inflammatory biomarkers. Conclusions Hyposmia and dysgeusia are common in SARS-CoV-2 infection and can precede systemic symptoms. They should be actively searched and prompt close monitoring and isolation until infection is confirmed or disproven. The lower number of total leukocytes and neutrophils in hyposmic patients might indicate an early-phase virus-induced cytopenia.";"https://doi.org/10.1212/cpj.0000000000001029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842076/";01/04/2021;nonintensive;0.9882
529;A dynamic response to exposures of healthcare workers to newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients or hospital personnel, in order to minimize cross transmission and need for suspension from work during the outbreak;10.1093/ofid/ofaa384;"BACKGROUND: During the corona virus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, many healthcare workers (HCWs) were exposed to infected persons, leading to suspension from work. We describe a dynamic response to exposures of HCWs at the Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem, to minimize the need for suspension from work. METHODS: We performed an epidemiological investigation following each exposure to a newly diagnosed COVID-19 patient or HCW; close contacts were suspended from work. During the course of the epidemic, we adjusted our isolation criteria according to the timing of exposure related to symptoms onset, use of personal protective equipment and duration of exposure. In parallel, we introduced universal masking and performed periodic SARS-CoV-2 screening for all hospital personnel. We analyzed the number of HCWs suspended weekly from work and those who subsequently acquired infection. RESULTS: In the 51 investigations conducted during March-May 2020, we interviewed 1095 HCWs and suspended 400 (37%) from work, most of them, 251 (63%), during the first two weeks of the outbreak. The median duration of exposure was 30 minutes (IQR, 15-120). Only 5/400 (1.3%) developed infection, all in the first two weeks of the epidemic. After introduction of universal masking and despite loosening the isolation criteria, none of the exposed HCWs developed COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively short exposures of HCWs, even if only either the worker or the patient wore a mask, probably poses a very low risk for infection. This allows us to perform strict follow-up of exposed HCWs in these exposures, combined with repeated testing, instead of suspension from work.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989418/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa384";01/09/2020;corona virus disease;0.9767
530;Imaging of COVID-19 simulators;10.1186/s43055-020-00379-9;BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It was highly contagious spreading all over the world, with a rapid increase in the number of deaths. The reported cases have reached more than 14 million with more than 600,000 deaths around the world. So, the pandemic of COVID-19 became a surpassing healthcare crisis with an intensive load on the healthcare resources. In this study, the aim was to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from its mimickers as atypical infection, interstitial lung diseases, and eosinophilic lung diseases based on CT, clinical, and laboratory findings. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 260 patients, of which 220 were confirmed as COVID-19 positive by two repeated RT-PCR test and 40 were classified as non-COVID by two repeated negative RT-PCR test or identification of other pathogens, other relevant histories, or clinical findings. In this study, 158 patients were male (60.7 %) and 102 patients were female (39.3%). There was 60.9% of the COVID-19 group were male and 39.1% were female. Patients in the non-COVID group were significantly older (the mean age was 46.4) than those in the confirmed COVID-19 group (35.2y). In the COVID-19 group, there was exposure history to positive cases in 84.1% while positive exposure history was 20% in the non-COVID group. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of CT imaging findings in COVID-19 pneumonia is wide that could be contributed by many other diseases making the interpretation of chest CTs nowadays challenging to differentiate between different diseases having the same signs and act as deceiving simulators in the era of COVID-19.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7783496/;05/01/2021;Coronavirus;0.9674
531;COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: a survey in a population highly compliant to common vaccinations.;10.1080/21645515.2021.1928460;Vaccination is a key protective factor against COVID-19. Some vaccines have already received emergency authorization from Health Agencies, but growing skepticism and vaccine hesitancy will probably affect COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. In the attempt to shed light on this issue, we conducted an online survey in a population of parents referring to 4 pediatric practices in Naples, Italy in whom we evaluated potential vaccine acceptability in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, perception of personal health and of the impact of COVID-19, and attitudes toward general vaccination practices. Vaccination rates were analyzed also in the corresponding pediatric population.Almost 27% of participants declared they were in favor of vaccinations, and in fact real life vaccination rates in children exceeded the national mean. Only 26.5% of respondents declared they would receive COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine refusal was attributed to safety concerns in 76% of parents. Specific vaccine attributes further reduced the acceptance rate. Female gender, younger age and lower education level were associated with non-adherence to vaccination. Among extrinsic factors of COVID-19 vaccination, only information from National Health Authorities was significantly associated to vaccine acceptance.The rate of potential COVID-19 vaccine acceptability was very poor in our population of parents. Vaccine hesitancy was mainly due to safety concerns. Demographic and educational factors were correlated to vaccine acceptability. Health education and communication strategies are needed to achieve large-scale vaccine acceptability and finally herd immunity.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1928460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34096836/";07/06/2021;Vaccination;0.9787
532;Combining Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy in Definitive Treatment of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Review of Current Clinical Trials;10.2478/raon-2020-0060;BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) presents as locally advanced disease in a majority of patients and is prone to relapse despite aggressive treatment. Since immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown clinically significant efficacy in patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC (R/M HNSCC), a plethora of trials are investigating their role in earlier stages of disease. At the same time, preclinical data showed the synergistic role of concurrently administered radiotherapy and ICIs (immunoradiotherapy) and explained several mechanisms behind it. Therefore, this approach is prospectively tested in a neoadjuvant, definitive, or adjuvant setting in non-R/M HNSCC patients. Due to the intricate relationship between host, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, each of these approaches has its advantages and disadvantages. In this narrative review we present the biological background of immunoradiotherapy, as well as a rationale for, and possible flaws of, each treatment approach, and provide readers with a critical summary of completed and ongoing trials. CONCLUSIONS: While immunotherapy with ICIs has already become a standard part of treatment in patients with R/M HNSCC, its efficacy in a non-R/M HNSCC setting is still the subject of extensive clinical testing. Irradiation can overcome some of the cancer’s immune evasive manoeuvres and can lead to a synergistic effect with ICIs, with possible additional benefits of concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy. However, the efficacy of this combination is not robust and details in trial design and treatment delivery seem to be of unprecedented importance.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064670/; https://doi.org/10.2478/raon-2020-0060";11/10/2020;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma;0.9369
533;Carnivore Protoparvovirus-1 Associated With an Outbreak of Hemorrhagic Gastroenteritis in Small Indian Civets.;10.1177/0300985820932144;Carnivore protoparvovirus-1 (CPPV-1) infection has been reported frequently in both domestic and wildlife species including wild carnivores. Fifty-five captive small Indian civets (Viverricula indica), farmed for perfume production in Eastern Thailand, showed clinical signs of acute bloody diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, circling, and seizures. The disease spread within the farm and resulted in the death of 38 of the 55 civets (69% mortality) within a month. Fecal swabs were collected from the 17 surviving civets, and necropsy was performed on 7 of the dead civets. Pathologic findings were severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with generalized lymphadenopathy. CPPV-1 was identified in both fecal swabs and postmortem samples by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. Further whole-gene sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggested feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) as the causative agent. The viral tropism and tissue distribution were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, with immunolabeling in the cytoplasm and nucleus of small intestinal crypt epithelial cells, villous enterocytes, histiocytes in lymphoid tissues, myenteric nerve plexuses, and cerebral and cerebellar neurons. Phylogenetic analysis of civet-derived CPPV-1 indicated a genetic similarity close to the FPV HH-1/86 strain detected in a jaguar (Panthera onca) in China. To our knowledge, this mass die-off of civets is the first evidence of disease associated with CPPV-1 infection in the subfamily Viverrinae. These findings support the multi-host range of parvovirus infection and raises awareness for CPPV-1 disease outbreaks in wildlife species.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985820932144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32880233/";01/09/2020;protoparvovirus-1;0.9014
534;Characteristics and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in healthcare workers at a London teaching hospital();10.1016/j.jhin.2020.07.025;BACKGROUND: Healthcare worker (HCW) associated COVID-19 is of global concern due to the potential for nosocomial spread and depletion of staff numbers. However, the literature on transmission routes and risk factors for COVID-19 in HCWs is limited. AIM: To examine the characteristics and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs in a university teaching hospital in London, UK. METHODS: Staff records and virology testing results were combined to identify staff sickness and COVID-19 rates from March to April 2020. Comparisons were made with staff professional groups, department of work and ethnicity. Analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel(TM). FINDINGS: COVID-19 rates in our HCWs largely rose and declined in parallel with the number of community cases. White and non-white ethnic groups among our HCWs had similar rates of infection. Clinical staff had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than non-clinical staff, but total sickness rates were similar. Doctors had the highest rate of infection, but took the fewest sickness days. Critical Care had lower rates than the Emergency Department (ED), but rates in the ED declined once all staff were advised to use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: These findings show that sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among our hospital staff did not occur, beyond the community outbreak, even in the absence of strict infection control measures in non-clinical areas. The results also suggest that current PPE is effective when used appropriately. In addition, our findings emphasise the importance of testing both clinical and non-clinical staff groups during a pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.07.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019567012030356X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019567012030356X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32730771/";28/07/2020;Healthcare worker;0.9518
535;Excited Catatonia — A Delayed Neuropsychiatric Complication of COVID-19 Infection;10.7759/cureus.13891;An increasing number of patients have been presenting with neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We present a case of a 69-year-old female with no prior psychiatric history who was brought to the emergency department due to bizarre behavior and paranoid thoughts for four to six weeks, worsening over the last two weeks. Psychiatric evaluation found that the patient had extreme restlessness and agitation, poor eye contact, paranoid delusions, visual hallucinations, and a flat affect with stereotypic repetition of speech and loose associations. The patient’s family noted that two months prior she had symptoms of common cold associated with a severe cough and 20 pounds of weight loss. Suspicion for prior COVID-19 infection prompted an IgG antibody test, which was positive. Our patient displayed at least three of the signs needed to diagnose catatonia - agitation, rigidity, and echolalia - and had a therapeutic response to lorazepam, confirming suspicions of excited catatonia. Her seropositivity for IgG against COVID-19 suggested a COVID-induced brief psychotic disorder with catatonia, which makes this the first known case, to our knowledge, of a patient with delayed onset catatonia after COVID-19 infection. This suggests that clinicians should, after ruling out more plausible stressors, suspect possible coronavirus involvement in sudden onset psychotic disorders, especially in patients who do not fit the demographic of new-onset schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses.

536;The contribution of specific non-communicable diseases to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 in Peru;10.1371/journal.pone.0240494;"BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have received political attention and commitment, yet surveillance is needed to measure progress and set priorities. Building on global estimates suggesting that Peru is not on target to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, we estimated the contribution of various NCDs to the change in unconditional probability of dying from NCDs in 25 regions in Peru. METHODS: Using national death registries and census data, we estimated the unconditional probability of dying between ages 30 and 69 from any and from each of the following NCDs: cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated the contribution of each NCD to the change in the unconditional probability of dying from any of these NCDs between 2006 and 2016. RESULTS: The overall unconditional probability of dying improved for men (21.4%) and women (23.3%). Cancer accounted for 10.9% in men and 13.7% in women of the overall reduction; cardiovascular diseases also contributed substantially: 11.3% in men) and 9.8% in women. Consistently in men and women and across regions, diabetes moved in the opposite direction of the overall reduction in the unconditional probability of dying from any selected NCD. Diabetes contributed a rise in the unconditional probability of 3.6% in men and 2.1% in women. CONCLUSIONS: Although the unconditional probability of dying from any selected NCD has decreased, diabetes would prevent Peru from meeting international targets.

537;High neutralizing potency of swine glyco‐humanized polyclonal antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2;10.1002/eji.202049072;Heterologous polyclonal antibodies might represent an alternative to the use of convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) by targeting multiple antigen epitopes. However, heterologous antibodies trigger human natural xenogeneic antibody responses particularly directed against animal‐type carbohydrates, mainly the N‐glycolyl form of the neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and the α1,3‐galactose, potentially leading to serum sickness or allergy. Here, we immunized cytidine monophosphate‐N‐acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase and α1,3‐galactosyl‐transferase (GGTA1) double KO pigs with the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) spike receptor binding domain to produce glyco‐humanized polyclonal neutralizing antibodies lacking Neu5Gc and α1,3‐galactose epitopes. Animals rapidly developed a hyperimmune response with anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 end‐titers binding dilutions over one to a million and end‐titers neutralizing dilutions of 1:10 000. The IgG fraction purified and formulated following clinical Good Manufacturing Practices, named XAV‐19, neutralized spike/angiotensin converting enzyme‐2 interaction at a concentration <1 μg/mL, and inhibited infection of human cells by SARS‐CoV‐2 in cytopathic assays. We also found that pig GH‐pAb Fc domains fail to interact with human Fc receptors, thereby avoiding macrophage‐dependent exacerbated inflammatory responses and a possible antibody‐dependent enhancement. These data and the accumulating safety advantages of using GH‐pAbs in humans warrant clinical assessment of XAV‐19 against COVID‐19.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.202049072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33576494/";02/03/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9926
538;A Gender Perspective of Addictive Disorders;10.1007/s40429-021-00357-9;"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Substance use disorders (SUD) affect differentially women and men. Although the prevalence has been reported higher in men, those women with addictive disorders present a more vulnerable profile and are less likely to enter treatment than men. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of how sex and gender may influence epidemiology, clinical manifestations, social impact, and the neurobiological basis of these differences of women with SUD, based on human research. RECENT FINDINGS: The differences in prevalence rates between genders are getting narrower; also, women tend to increase the amount of consumption more rapidly than men, showing an accelerated onset of the SUD (telescoping effect). In respect to clinical features, the most important differences are related to the risk of experience psychiatric comorbidity, the exposure to intimate partner violence, and the associated high risks in sexual and reproductive health; and those who are mothers and addicted to substances are at risk of losing the custody of children accumulating more adverse life events. Some of these differences can be based on neurobiological differences: pharmacokinetic response to substances, sensitivity to gonadal hormones, differences in neurobiological systems as glutamate, endocannabinoids, and genetic differences. SUMMARY: Specific research in women who use drugs is very scarce and treatments are not gender-sensitive oriented. For these reasons, it is important to guarantee access to the appropriate treatment of women who use drugs and a need for a gender perspective in the treatment and research of substance use disorders.";"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-021-00357-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614395/";16/02/2021;Substance use disorders;0.9548
539;The role of afferent pulmonary innervation in ARDS associated with COVID-19 and potential use of resiniferatoxin to improve prognosis: A review;10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100033;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the major causes of mortality associated with COVID-19 disease. Many patients will require intensive care with ventilatory support. Despite progress and best efforts, the mortality rates projected remain high. Historical data outlook points towards 80% expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease, even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This is particularly true among the patient population over 65. Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress. We hypothesize that the morbidity, severity of the disease, and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the TRPV1 expressing neuronal system (afferent/efferent neurons) in the lungs. TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression. We suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes. We also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590098620300208; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590098620300208?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292906/";04/04/2020;Acute respiratory distress syndrome;0.9366
540;“Ambulatory Management of Moderate to High Risk COVID-19 Patients: The Coronavirus Related Outpatient Work Navigators (CROWN) Protocol”;10.1177/1084822320964196;During the height of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in New York City, area hospitals were filled to 150% capacity, and there was a significant fear among the public of going to the hospital. Many hospitalized patients were treated with therapies that could be administered in a home setting under proper monitoring. We designed the CROWN Program, a Home-Care based ambulatory protocol to evaluate, monitor, and treat moderate to high risk COVID-19 patients in their homes, with escalation to hospital care when necessary. Patients were evaluated with telehealth visits with a Pulmonologist, and a Home-Care protocol, including RN visit, pulse-oximetry, and oxygen, lab-work, intravenous fluids, medication if needed patient data, comorbidities, and symptoms were collected. Labs, including COVID-19 PCR, D Dimer, CRP, Ferritin, Procalcitonin, CBC, and metabolic panel were measured, as were homecare, home oxygen, and intravenous fluids orders, radiographic studies and initiation of an anticoagulant. Emergency Department visits and need for hospital admission during the study period were recorded. A total of 182 patients were enrolled between the start date of April 27th and June 1st, and fell into two categories: not-admitted (101) and post-discharge (81). Two patients were referred for hospital admission, seven were treated and released from the ED, and one was referred to home hospice. There were no unexpected admissions or deaths. The CROWN program has demonstrated the feasibility and apparent safety of a specialized, Home-Care based protocol for the ambulatory management of moderate to high risk COVID-19 patients.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7565243/;15/10/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9679
541;When Social Isolation Might Save Your Life: An MIT AgeLab Study of Living Through the COVID-19 Crisis at Age 85 and Over;10.1093/geroni/igaa057.1560;Previous research shows that social isolation is associated with increased mortality rates among older adults. However, in the face of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), social distancing was prescribed as a potentially lifesaving measure, particularly for older adults. In this session, MIT AgeLab researchers will present findings from a mixed methods study with the MIT AgeLab 85+ Lifestyle Leaders, a panel study of octogenarians and nonagenarians that began in September 2015. In March 2020, AgeLab researchers began conducting a series of telephone interviews (n=15) with Lifestyle Leaders and collected quantitative data via an online survey (n=25). Together, the interviews and survey inquired about Lifestyle Leaders’ attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19, as well as their uses of technology throughout the crisis. Findings suggest that fears about the impacts of coronavirus transcended multiple domains of the Lifestyle Leaders’ lives, including their physical, socioemotional, and financial wellbeing. Lifestyle Leaders were asked about functional and emotional repercussions of social distancing and other precautions they had taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and to protect themselves from contracting the virus. Special attention was paid to differences in lived experiences of the COVID-19 crisis among Lifestyle Leaders who were living independently versus those who were living in assisted living or continuing care retirement communities. Findings from this study suggest that socially-connected emergency preparedness measures will become increasingly important for the growing number of octogenarians and nonagenarians.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742501/;16/12/2020;coronavirus;0.9647

However, the characteristics and risk factors associated with disease severity, unimprovement and mortality are unclear. Methods All consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11 to February 6, 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Results A total of 663 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Among those, 247 (37.3%) had at least one kind of chronic disease. A total of 0.5% (n=3) of patients were diagnosed with mild COVID-19, while 37.8% (251/663), 47.5% (315/663), and 14.2% (94/663) were in moderate, severe, and critical condition, respectively. In our hospital during follow-up, 251 of 663 (37.9%) patients were improved and 25 patients died, leading to a mortality rate of 3.77%. Older patients (>60 years old) and those with chronic diseases were prone to have severe and critical COVID-19 conditions, show unimprovement, and die (P < 0.001, < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified being male (OR = 0.486, 95% CI 0.311-0.758; P = 0.001), having severe COVID-19 conditions (OR = 0.129, 95% CI 0.082-0.201; P < 0.001), expectoration (OR = 1.796, 95% CI 1.062-3.036; P = 0.029), muscle ache (OR = 0.309, 95% CI 0.153-0.626; P = 0.001), and decreased albumin (OR = 1.929, 95% CI 1.199-3.104; P = 0.007) were associated with unimprovement in COVID-19 patients.

543;Visceral adiposity and severe COVID-19 disease: application of an artificial intelligence algorithm to improve clinical risk prediction;10.1093/ofid/ofab275;BACKGROUND: Obesity has been linked to severe clinical outcomes among people who are hospitalized with COVID-19. We tested the hypothesis that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with severe outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, independent of body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We analyzed data from the Massachusetts General Hospital COVID-19 Data Registry, which included patients admitted with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 11 - May 4, 2020. We used a validated, fully automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to quantify VAT from CT scans during or prior to the hospital admission. VAT quantification took an average 2±0.5 seconds per patient. We dichotomized VAT as high and low at a threshold of ≥100 cm(2) and used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression to assess the relationship between VAT and death or intubation over 28 days, adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI and diabetes status. RESULTS: 378 participants had CT imaging. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that participants with high VAT had a greater risk of the outcome compared to those with low VAT (p<0.005), especially in those with BMI <30 kg/m (2) (p<0.005). In multivariable models, the aHR for high vs. low VAT was unchanged [aHR 1.97 (1.24 – 3.09)], whereas BMI was no longer significant [aHR for obese vs. normal BMI 1.14 (0.71 – 1.82)]. CONCLUSIONS: High VAT is associated with a greater risk of severe disease or death in COVID-19, and can offer more precise information to risk stratify individuals beyond BMI. AI offers a promising approach to routinely ascertain VAT and improve clinical risk prediction in COVID-19.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8244656/;28/05/2021;independent of body mass index;0.9076
544;COVID-19: a review on SARS-CoV-2 origin, epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations and complications with special emphasis on adverse outcome in Bhopal Gas Tragedy survivor.;10.1515/hmbci-2020-0070;After the global outbreak of coronaviruses caused diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an outbreak due to these viruses occurred in December, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and led to a worldwide spread. Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a serious global health emergency and spread from a person to another who has the virus. But the scope of an intermediate host is not known. Population at higher risk includes individuals in higher age group (>60 years) or with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and weaker immune system. Many unknown and underestimate risk factors could be responsible for adverse outcomes in COVID-19. These risk factors should be appropriately identified, addressed and necessary actions should be taken to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic. Bhopal gas tragedy was one of the world's worst industrial chemical leak disaster. The survivors of this incident still suffer from the various complications such as increased rate of cancers, chronic illness like tuberculosis, respiratory diseases, birth defects, nerve injury, growth retardations, gynecological illness and many more. The survivors of Bhopal gas tragedy are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 related adverse outcome. One of the possible explanations can be long term effect of methyl isocyanate (MIC). MIC exposure can lead to possible toxic effect on genetic, epigenetic and non-genetic factors. In this review, we aim to establish the scientific basis for adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients who are also victims of Bhopal gas tragedy.;"https://doi.org/10.1515/hmbci-2020-0070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600673/";18/02/2021;Coronavirus 2019 disease;0.9276
545;Podiatry as a career in the UK - what attracts Generation Z? A qualitative exploration with university and college students;10.1186/s13047-021-00470-y;"BACKGROUND: Training for a career in podiatry is reported to provide graduates with excellent employability, alongside professional autonomy and suitable renumeration. Yet, there has been an ongoing decline in the number of those applying to study the subject. There is limited literature associated with this topic and we sought to explore the factors that attract ‘generation Z’ (those born 1995–2010) to a potential career in podiatry. METHOD: A qualitative design framework underpinned by phenomenological principles used four focus groups over a two-year period to generate data from participants at University and in Further Education. Focus group conversations were led by external facilitator, recorded, independently transcribed verbatim and anonymised prior to thematic analysis. This was followed by external, independent verification of themes. RESULTS: Four main themes were determined from the analysis i) a lack of awareness of podiatry; ii) podiatry: accessible course, accessible career; iii) career status; iv) breadth/opportunity of the scope of practice. Both positive and negative experiences were reported and highlighted key gaps in how the attractiveness of a career in podiatry is portrayed. CONCLUSION: The chronic lack of awareness of podiatry as a career clearly needs to be addressed, ideally with more positive role modelling in mainstream and popular media. The career status offered together with the breadth of, and opportunity associated with, the scope of practice should continue to be celebrated.

546;Exploring the challenges faced by frontline workers in health and social care amid the COVID-19 pandemic: experiences of frontline workers in the English Midlands region, UK.;10.1080/13561820.2020.1792425;The first cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Globally millions of people have been diagnosed with the virus whilst thousands have died. As the virus kept spreading health and social care frontline workers (HSCFW) were faced with difficulties when discharging their duties. This paper was set out to explore the challenges faced by different frontline workers in health and social care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research utilized an explorative qualitative approach. A total of forty (N = 40) in-depth one-to-one semi-structured interviews were undertaken with HSCFW who included support workers (n = 15), nurses (n = 15), and managers (N = 10). Health and social care workers were drawn from domiciliary care and care homes (with and without nursing services). All the interviews were done online. The data were thematically analyzed, and the emergent themes were supported by quotes from the interviews held with participants. Following data analysis the research study found that lack of pandemic preparedness, shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), anxiety and fear amongst professionals, challenges in enforcing social distancing, challenges in fulfilling social shielding responsibility, anxiety and fear amongst residents and service users, delay in testing, evolving PPE guidance and shortage of staff were challenges faced by frontline health and social care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the current study point to a need for adequate pandemic preparedness within the health and social care sector to protect both frontline workers and the individuals they look after.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2020.1792425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32674701/";17/07/2020;Coronavirus;0.9938
547;A simple ecological model captures the transmission pattern of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in China;10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928;"The rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), initially reported in the city of Wuhan in China, and quickly transmitted to the entire nation and beyond, has become an international public health emergency. Estimating the final number of infection cases and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the current control measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measures could be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak.";https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928;29/02/2020;coronavirus;0.9584
548;Assessment of the Impact of Media Coverage on COVID-19–Related Google Trends Data: Infodemiology Study;10.2196/19611;BACKGROUND: The influence of media coverage on web-based searches may hinder the role of Google Trends (GT) in monitoring coronavirus disease (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether COVID-19–related GT data, particularly those related to ageusia and anosmia, were primarily related to media coverage or to epidemic trends. METHODS: We retrieved GT query data for searches on coronavirus, cough, anosmia, and ageusia and plotted them over a period of 5 years. In addition, we analyzed the trends of those queries for 17 countries throughout the year 2020 with a particular focus on the rises and peaks of the searches. For anosmia and ageusia, we assessed whether the respective GT data correlated with COVID-19 cases and deaths both throughout 2020 and specifically before March 16, 2020 (ie, the date when the media started reporting that these symptoms can be associated with COVID-19). RESULTS: Over the last five years, peaks for coronavirus searches in GT were only observed during the winter of 2020. Rises and peaks in coronavirus searches appeared at similar times in the 17 different assessed countries irrespective of their epidemic situations. In 15 of these countries, rises in anosmia and ageusia searches occurred in the same week or 1 week after they were identified in the media as symptoms of COVID-19. When data prior to March 16, 2020 were analyzed, anosmia and ageusia GT data were found to have variable correlations with COVID-19 cases and deaths in the different countries. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that COVID-19–related GT data are more closely related to media coverage than to epidemic trends.;"https://doi.org/10.2196/19611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530816/";10/08/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9723
549;Propofol versus midazolam for sedation during radiofrequency ablation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.;10.1002/jgh3.12483;"Background and Aim Standardization of the sedation protocol during radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is needed. This randomized, single-blind, investigator-initiated trial compared clinical outcomes during and after RFA using propofol and midazolam, respectively, in patients with HCC. Methods Few- and small-nodule HCC patients (≤3 nodules and ≤3 cm) were randomly assigned to either propofol or midazolam. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) (1 mm = not at all satisfied, 100 mm = completely satisfied). Sedation recovery rates 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after RFA were evaluated based on Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scores; full recovery was defined as a MOAA/S score of 5. Results Between July 2013 and September 2017, 143 patients with HCC were enrolled, and 135 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group. Compared with midazolam, propofol exhibited similar median procedural satisfaction (propofol: 73.1 mm, midazolam: 76.9 mm, P = 0.574). Recovery rates 1 and 2 h after RFA were higher in the propofol group than in the midazolam group. Meanwhile, recovery rates observed 3 and 4 h after RFA were similar in the two groups. The safety profiles during and after RFA were almost identical in the two groups. Conclusion Patient satisfaction was almost identical in patients receiving propofol and midazolam sedation during RFA.

However, their accessibility can be limited by the long examination time and inability to evaluate multiple samples at once. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the analytical performance of the newly developed rapid molecular assays GENECUBE(®) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GENECUBE(®) FLU A/B. METHOD: This prospective study was conducted between 14 December 2020 and 9 January 2021 at a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) center. Samples were collected from the nasopharynx with flocked swabs. Molecular tests were performed with the GENECUBE(®) system and reference reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and the results of the two assays were compared. RESULT: Among 1065 samples, 81 (7.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the reference RT-PCR. Three showed discordance between GENECUBE(®) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the reference RT-PCR; the total, positive, and negative samples of concordance for the two assays were 99.7%, 100%, and 99.7%, respectively. All discordant cases were positive with GENECUBE(®) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and negative with the reference RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all three samples using another molecular assay for SARS-CoV-2.

551;Using curvature to infer COVID-19 fractal epidemic network fragility and systemic risk;10.1101/2020.04.01.20047225;The damage of the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is reaching unprecedented scales. There are numerous classical epidemiology models trying to quantify epidemiology metrics. Usually, to forecast the epidemics, these classical approaches need parameter estimations, such as the contagion rate or the basic reproduction number. Here we propose a data-driven, parameter-free approach to access the fragility and systemic risk of epidemic networks by studying the Forman-Ricci curvature. Network curvature has been used successfully to forecast risk in financial networks and we suggest that those results can be translated for COVID-19 epidemic time series as well. We first show that our hypothesis is true in a toy-model of epidemic time series with delays, which generates epidemic networks. By doing so, we are able to verify that the Forman-Ricci curvature can be a parameter-free estimate for the fragility and risk of the network at each stage of the simulated pandemic. On this basis, we then compute the Forman-Ricci curvature for real epidemic networks built from epidemic time series available from the World Health Organization (WHO). The Forman-Ricci curvature allow us to detect early warning signs of the emergence of the pandemic. The advantage of the method lies in providing an early geometrical data marker for epidemics, without the need of parameter estimation and stochastic modeling. The strategy above, together with other data-driven tools for investigating epidemic network dynamics, can be readily implemented on a daily basis to quickly estimate the growth, risk and fragility of real COVID-19 epidemic networks at different scales.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047225;06/04/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9703

An early assessment of illness severity is important for the stratification of patients. We analysed the predictive value of National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) for intensive care unit admission (ICU) in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Methods: Data of 71 patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted from 1 March to 20 April 2020, to the Clinic of Infectious Diseases of Perugia Hospital, Italy, were retrospectively reviewed. NEWS2 at hospital admission, demographic, comorbidity and clinical data were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to establish the correlation between each variable and ICU admission.Results: Among 68 patients included in the analysis, 27 were admitted to ICU. NEWS2 at hospital admission was a good predictor of ICU admission as shown by an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis of 0.90 (standard error 0.04; 95% confidence interval 0.82-0.97). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, NEWS2 was significantly related to ICU admission using thresholds of 5 and 7. No other clinical variables included in the model were significantly correlated with ICU admission.A NEWS2 threshold of 5 had higher sensitivity than a threshold of 7 (89% and 63%).

553;Single or double-layer uterine closure techniques following cesarean: A randomized trial.;10.1111/aogs.14018;INTRODUCTION Cesarean deliveries are commonly performed throughout the world. While the uterine closure technique following this procedure may influence how the uterine scar heals, there is insufficient evidence for choosing the appropriate technique and thus preventing long-term negative consequences. This prospective sized study examined the effects of single- and double-layer uterine closure techniques on uterine-scar healing following cesarean delivery. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study assessed a total of 282 women aged 18-45 years who were in gestational weeks 24-41 of singleton pregnancies. None had previously undergone uterine surgeries. These participants completed their first cesarean deliveries at the time of study and were randomized into the following two treatment groups: single-layer closure with locking and double-layer closure with locking in the first layer, but not in the second layer (NCT03629028). However, the decidua was not included for treatment in either group. Participants were evaluated at 6-9 months after cesarean section by saline infusion sonohysterography to assess cesarean delivery scar defects. These procedures were conducted by experienced sonographers who were not concerned about the uterine closure technique. RESULTS Of the 225 final participants, 109 received the single-layer closure technique, while 116 received the double-layer technique. The niche rates were 37% (n=40) for the single-layer group and 45.7% (n=53) for the double-layer group (p=0.22, RR 1.4, 95% CI=0.8-4.4).

554;Knowledge of standard precautions among healthcare professionals at a Teaching Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan;10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1622_20;BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are infections acquired by patients during their hospital stay which they did not have previously. This also includes infections acquired by healthcare professionals while managing infected patients. Since both healthcare professionals and patients can be a source of spreading infections across there is a need of practicing standard precautions religiously, to minimize this risk. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of healthcare professionals working at The Indus Hospital, a tertiary care hospital of Karachi, Pakistan. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2017 and July 2018. 205 employees working at The Indus Hospital, Karachi were recruited in this study. A self-made questionnaire based on CDC guidelines was administered to the participants and their responses were recorded. RESULTS: Among all participants, nearly two-thirds (70%) had a very good knowledge of the use of standard precautions, 19.5% had good knowledge, and 12.2% had average/below average knowledge. Of those having very good knowledge, most of them were doctors (60%). Older age groups had more knowledge than the younger age groups. CONCLUSION: Our study concluded that among different healthcare workers, the nurses had less knowledge as compared to doctors. There was a significant association found between the age of the healthcare professionals and the information he/she has on the standard precautions. Improving the knowledge of doctors and nurses would help in breaking the chain of nosocomial infections and will decrease the burden of infectious diseases on our society.;"https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1622_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017735/";30/01/2021;Hospital-acquired infections;0.9579
555;Flow-controlled ventilation during EVLP improves oxygenation and preserves alveolar recruitment;10.1186/s40635-020-00360-w;BACKGROUND: Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a widespread accepted platform for preservation and evaluation of donor lungs prior to lung transplantation (LTx). Standard lungs are ventilated using volume-controlled ventilation (VCV). We investigated the effects of flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) in a large animal EVLP model. Fourteen porcine lungs were mounted on EVLP after a warm ischemic interval of 2 h and randomized in two groups (n = 7/group). In VCV, 7 grafts were conventionally ventilated and in FCV, 7 grafts were ventilated by flow-controlled ventilation. EVLP physiologic parameters (compliance, pulmonary vascular resistance and oxygenation) were recorded hourly. After 6 h of EVLP, broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and biopsies for wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio and histology were taken. The left lung was inflated, frozen in liquid nitrogen vapors and scanned with computed tomography (CT) to assess regional distribution of Hounsfield units (HU). RESULTS: All lungs endured 6 h of EVLP. Oxygenation was better in FCV compared to VCV (p = 0.01) and the decrease in lung compliance was less in FCV (p = 0.03). W/D ratio, pathology and BAL samples did not differ between both groups (p = 0.16, p = 0.55 and p = 0.62). Overall, CT densities tended to be less pronounced in FCV (p = 0.05). Distribution of CT densities revealed a higher proportion of well-aerated lung parts in FCV compared to VCV (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: FCV in pulmonary grafts mounted on EVLP is feasible and leads to improved oxygenation and alveolar recruitment. This ventilation strategy might prolong EVLP over time, with less risk for volutrauma and atelectrauma.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7686942/;25/11/2020;Ex vivo lung perfusion;0.9486
556;State-level Stay-at-home Orders and Objectively Measured Movement in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic.;10.1097/psy.0000000000000905;"OBJECTIVE Social distancing has been one of the primary interventions used to slow the spread of COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. Although state-wide stay-at-home orders in the United States received a large degree of media and political attention, relatively little peer-reviewed research has examined the impacts of such orders social distancing behaviors. METHOD This study used daily GPS-derived movement from 2,858 counties in the United States from March 1 to May 7, 2020 to test the degree to which changes in state-level stay-at-home orders were associated with movement outside the home. RESULTS From early March to early April, people in counties with state-level stay-at-home orders decreased their movement significantly more than counties without state-level stay-at-home orders; 3.1% more people stayed within 1 mile of home and 1.6% fewer vehicle miles were driven per day. From early April to early May, people in counties within states that ended their stay-at-home orders increased their movement significantly more than counties in states whose stay-at-home orders remained in place; 1.2% fewer people remained within 1 mile of home and 6.2% more vehicle miles were driven per day. The magnitude of changes associated with state-level stay-at-home orders were many times smaller than the total changes in movement across all counties over the same periods. CONCLUSIONS Stay-at-home orders were associated with greater social distancing, but accounted for only part of this behavioral change. Research on behavior change would be useful to determine additional interventions that could support social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.";"https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0000000000000905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33395214/";30/12/2020;OBJECTIVE Social distancing;0.9208
557;Physiotherapy and pelvic floor health within a contemporary biopsychosocial model of care: From research to education and clinical practice;10.4102/sajp.v77i1.1538;BACKGROUND: Pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) is a common problem in both men and women. Despite the high prevalence and negative effects on quality of life, there is still a lack of research in this area which translates into clinical practice and education. OBJECTIVES: My study discusses how gaps and controversies in current research and evidence on PFD might be addressed by positioning PFD within a contemporary biopsychosocial model of care (BPSM). METHOD: Various databases were searched for relevant studies published between 2010 and 2020 to support hypotheses and statements. RESULTS: My study focuses on the available evidence of PFD in both men and women as related to the themes and sub-themes of the BPSM, and how this available evidence might translate into education and clinical practice. It highlights areas of research, education and clinical practice that need to be explored and how the different components of healthcare may influence one another. CONCLUSION: Biomedical aspects regarding pelvic health are mostly investigated and taught, whilst psychological, cognitive, behavioural, social and occupational factors, individualised care, communication and therapeutic alliances are still under-investigated and not integrated or translated at a sufficient level into research, education and clinical practice. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Incorporating the integration of all factors of the BPSM into research is important for effective knowledge translation and enhancement of a de-compartmentalised approach to management. The interaction between the different components of the BPSM should be investigated especially in a South African population.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182461/;20/05/2021;Pelvic floor dysfunction;0.9579
558;The role of CT chest in screening for asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in self-isolating patients prior to elective oncological surgery: findings from a UK Cancer Hub.;10.1259/bjr.20200994;OBJECTIVES In accordance with initial guidance from the Royal College of Surgeons and Royal College of Radiologists, we evaluated the utility of CT of the chest in the exclusion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection prior to elective cancer surgery on self-isolating patients during the pandemic. METHODS All surgical referrals without symptoms of COVID-19 infection in April and May 2020 were included. Patient records were retrospectively reviewed. Screening included CT chest for major thoracic and abdominal surgery. CTs were reported according to British Society of Thoracic Imaging guidelines and correlated with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and surgical outcomes. RESULTS The prevalence of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection in our screened population was 0.7% (5/681). 240 pre-operative CTs were performed. 3.8% (9/240) of CTs were reported as abnormal, only one of which was RT-PCR positive. 2% (5/240) of cases had surgery postponed based on CT results. All nine patients with CTs reported as abnormal have had surgery, all without complication. CONCLUSION The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in our screened population was low. The pre-test probability of CT chest in asymptomatic, self-isolating patients is consequently low. CT can produce false positives in this setting, introducing unnecessary delay in surgery for a small proportion of cases. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Self-isolation, clinical assessment and RT-PCR are effective at minimising COVID-19 related surgical risk. The addition of CT chest is unhelpful. Our data have particular relevance during the second wave of infection and in the recovery phase.;"https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242245/";26/11/2020;asymptomatic;0.9341
559;A Census of Star Formation in the Outer Galaxy. II. The GLIMPSE360 Field.;10.3847/1538-3881/ab99c8;"We have conducted a study of star formation in the outer Galaxy from 65°< l < 265°in the region observed by the GLIMPSE360 program. This Spitzer warm mission program mapped the plane of the outer Milky Way with IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. We combine the IRAC, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and Two Micron All Sky Survey catalogs and our previous results from another outer Galaxy survey and identify a total of 47,338 young stellar objects (YSOs) across the field spanning >180° in Galactic longitude. Using the DBSCAN method on the combined catalog, we identify 618 clusters or aggregations of YSOs having five or more members. We identify 10,476 class I, 29,604 class II, and 7325 anemic class II/class III YSOs. The ratio of YSOs identified as members of clusters was 25,528/47,338, or 54%. We found that 100 of the clusters identified have previously measured distances in the WISE H II survey. We used these distances in our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of the YSOs in these clusters, of which 96 had YSOs with <3σ fits. We used the derived masses from the SED model fits to estimate the initial mass function (IMF) in the inner and outer Galaxy clusters; dividing the clusters by galactocentric distances, the slopes were Γ = 1.87 ± 0.31 above 3 M ⵙ for R Gal < 11.5 kpc and Γ = 1.15 ± 0.24 above 3 M ⵙ for R Gal > 11.5 kpc. The slope of the combined IMF was found to be Γ = 1.92 ± 0.42 above 3 M ⵙ. These values are consistent with each other within the uncertainties and with literature values in the inner Galaxy high-mass star formation regions. The slopes are likely also consistent with a universal Salpeter IMF.";"https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ab99c8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831350/";01/08/2020;spectral energy distribution;0.9142
560;Assessment & mitigation of O2 therapy driven spread of COVID-19;10.1101/2021.02.06.21251266;BACKGROUND: Exhalation exposure from patients to healthcare workers (HCWs), while using a nasal cannula or simple O2 mask used in treating COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases, is a present and future risk. Little is known on exhalation dispersal through these devices, and on mitigating the viral exposure to those in the vicinity. METHODS: Respiration through O2 therapy devices was studied with a supine manikin equipped with a controllable mechanical lung by measuring aerosol density and flow with direct imaging. Dispersal direction and distances were quantified while placing a surgical mask loosely over the devices and contrasted with unmitigated oxygenation device use. Exhalation jets were examined over the entire range of oxygenation rates used in treatment. RESULTS: Exhalation jets travel 0.35 plus/minus 0.02 m upward while wearing a nasal cannula, and 0.29 plus/minus 0.02 m laterally while wearing a simple O2 mask posing significant inhalation risk. Placing a surgical facemask loosely over the oxygenation device is demonstrated to alleviate exposure by reducing and deflecting the exhalation jets from being launched forward, and by reducing exhalations from being launched directly higher over a supine patient. Less than 12% of the exhaled breath is observed to reach above a masked face where HCWs would be present, independent of oxygen flow rates. CONCLUSIONS: Exhalation jets from both the nasal cannula or simple O2 mask were found to concentrate aerosol-laden exhalations directly in front of a patient's face. Exposure is effectively mitigated with a surgical mask which reduces and redirects the exhalation downward away from HCWs.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.21251266v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.06.21251266";08/02/2021;Exhalation exposure from patients to healthcare workers;0.9106
561;COVID-19 and Spillover Effect of Global Economic Crisis on the United States’ Financial Stability;10.3389/fpsyg.2021.632175;Due to the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), the lockdown engendered has had a vicious impact on the global economy. This analysis’ prime intention is to evaluate the impact of the United States’ economic and health crisis as a result of COVID-19 on its financial stability. Additionally, the investigation analyzed the spillover impact of the worldwide economic slowdown experienced by COVID-19 on the United States’ financial volatility. The study applied an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model and discovered that the economic and health crises that occurred in the United States portentously upset the future expectations of its investors. Conspicuously, the health crisis in Spain and Italy were ominous spillovers of the United States’ financial instability in the short-run. Likewise, an economic crisis ensued in the United Kingdom because of COVID-19 causing spillover for the United States markets’ financial instability. The examination evaluated that Asian and African nations’ economic crises perilously affects the United States’ financial stability. The study determined that financial instability occurred in the United States due to its own economic and health crises persisted for a longer period than financial disequilibrium that occurred in other nations. The analysis suggested some strategies of smart lockdown that the government of the United States and other nations should follow to restart the economic cycle through tighter controls to minimize losses by following the steps of (a) preparing a lockdown checklist, (b) monitoring completion of lockdown tasks, and (c) complete a close-down stock take or count.;"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.632175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716899/";26/02/2021;coronavirus pandemic;0.9485
562;Innovative countermeasures can maintain cancer care continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea;10.1016/j.ejca.2020.06.021;"BACKGROUND: Even though Korea was known to have the highest number of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection in the early phase of the pandemic, Korea was able to successfully flatten the curve in a short period of time without extreme measures. We compared the status of cancer management before and after COVID-19 and analyzed how cancer care continuity was maintained in Korea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the medical records on the number of cancer diagnosis, cancer surgery, radiation therapy and scheduled chemotherapy conducted in Korea University Anam Hospital from January 1 to April 30, 2019 and from the same period in 2020. We also collected the data of metastatic cancer patients who were hospitalized due to respiratory disease. RESULTS: 1694 cancer diagnoses were made in the study period of 2019, and 1445 diagnoses in 2020 (decreased by 14.7%); the cancer surgery performed 830 and 800 cases; the set-up for radiation therapy decreased from 185 to 140 cases; the number of systemic chemotherapies for metastatic cancer patients treated in department of medical oncology increased from 2555 to 2878 cases. Among hospitalized patients, emergency center visit, intensive care unit admission, discharge after recovery and death reveal no drastic changes.

A potential increase in PJI diagnoses, especially in combination with psychological comorbidities may become a significant challenge for healthcare stakeholders. So far, the prevalence for Germany is unknown, which makes it difficult to estimate future treatment demand or to predict developments that can be influenced by adapting prevention and treatment measures. OBJECTIVES: The present study provides a detailed overview of the epidemiology of periprosthetic joint infections and psychological comorbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dataset provided by the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) consisting of annual, Germany-wide ICD-10 diagnosis codes from 2009 through 2019 was analyzed. Incidences of the code “T84.5—Infection and inflammatory reaction due to joint arthroplasty” were quantified, and a detailed breakdown of this data by age group and gender was performed. Prevalence rates of secondary diagnoses of the ICD-10 chapter F were determined. RESULTS: PJI diagnoses have been steadily increasing since 2009. The incidence declined in 2018. In 2019, 16,174 cases were registered, corresponding to a prevalence of 23.8/100,000 population. A trend towards more diagnoses in elderly patients became evident. Twenty-five percent of all patients had a secondary diagnosis regarding mental and behavioural disorders. The number of patients with psychological comorbidities doubled in the last decade.

564;Early human milk lactoferrin during SARS-CoV-2 infection.;10.1080/14767058.2021.1920010;"BACKGROUND/AIM Early human milk provides protection against viral infections due to its high nutritional value, abundance of maternal antibodies and the specific role of lactoferrin (Lf). Lf blocks the early interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host cells by binding to specific cell receptors and has been proposed as a preventative and adjunct treatment for COVID-19. This preliminary report aimed to investigate concentrations of Lf in early milk of SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers versus non-infected controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS In a cohort of 13 SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and 15 controls, breast milk concentrations of Lf were determined by ELISA on day 3 postpartum. Additionally, colostrum samples of infected mothers were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG determination using RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS No differences were found in breast milk Lf concentrations between SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and controls. In a subgroup analysis, however, symptomatic mothers (n = 7) presented with lower breast milk Lf concentrations, as compared to asymptomatic mothers (p = .041) and healthy controls (p = .029). All milk samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Early human milk of infected mothers displayed IgA and IgG SARS-CoV-2 specific reactivity. CONCLUSIONS Our data showed a different early breast milk Lf ""profile"" between COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic mothers with the latter being at non-COVID levels (control group). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any breast milk sample.

565;The effects of chlorination, thickness, and moisture on glove donning efficiency.;10.1080/00140139.2021.1907452;"Changing gloves more frequently is encouraged, more now than ever given the COVID-19 pandemic. When the donning process has moisture introduced, however, complications can arise, which consumes vital time. Most commonly, gloves undergo a chlorination treatment to reduce glove tack, allowing easier donning. To assess the effects of different chlorination strengths and glove thicknesses on donning, acrylonitrile butadiene gloves were manufactured at two different thicknesses (0.05 and 0.10 mm) with 4 different chlorination treatments: 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm. Six participants were used to assess the time taken to don each of the glove sets with dry and wet hands (16 tests in total). Overall, the thicker gloves took longer to don, due to differences in the material stiffness hindering the donning process. The quickest performance from the chlorinated gloves was noted in the 1000 and 2000 ppm concentrations. Wet conditions also showed significant increases in the donning time.Practitioners Summary: The study was conducted based on the gaps identified in previous literature reviews which revealed the requirement for a greater understanding of glove donning process. It was found a stronger chlorination was detrimental when the hands were wet, but better when dry. Thicker gloves were also found to be detrimental.

566;Elucidating the Pivotal Role of Immune Players in the Management of COVID-19: Focus on Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Inflammation.;10.2174/1574888x15666200705213751;"The world is currently engulfed with a viral disease with no cure. So, far, millions of people are infected with the virus across the length and breadth of world with thousand losing their lives each passing day. The WHO is February 2020 classified the virus as a coronavirus and the name Coronavirus-19 (CoV-19) was offered to the virus. The disease caused by the virus was termed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with elevation of several immune plays as well as inflammatory factors which contributes to cytokine storms. Currently, the detection of CoV-19 RNA is through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of suppressing several kinds of cytokines via the paracrine secretion system. Therefore, MSCs therapy could be game charges in the treatment of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Also, intravenous IG may be capable of suppressing the high expression of IL-6 by the CoV-19 resulting in lessen disease burden. Anti-inflammatory medications like, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, glycyrrhetinic acid, as well as etoposide may be very advantageous in decreasing the COVID-19 burden because, their mode of action targets the cytokine storms initiated by the CoV-19. It is important to indicate that, these medication does not target the virus itself. Therefore, potent CoV-19 anti-viral medications are needed to completely cure patients with COVID-19. Also, a vaccine is urgently needed to stop the spread of the virus.

OBJECTIVE: This observational cohort study aimed to assess all‐cause and cause‐specific mortality in patients with hemophilia in the Netherlands between 2001 and 2018 and to compare mortality and life expectancy with previous survival assessments from 1973 onward. PATIENTS/METHODS: All 1066 patients with hemophilia who participated in a nationwide survey in 2001 were followed until July 2018. RESULTS: Information on 1031 individuals (97%) was available, of whom 142 (14%) deceased during follow‐up. Compared with the general Dutch male population, mortality of patients with hemophilia was still increased (standardized mortality ratio: 1.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.2–1.7). Intracranial bleeding and malignancies were the most common causes of death. Estimated median life expectancy of patients with hemophilia was 77 years, 6 years lower than the median life expectancy of the general Dutch male population (83 years). Over the past 45 years, death rates of patients with hemophilia have consistently decreased, approaching the survival experience of the general population. Over the past decades, mortality due to human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections has decreased, death due to intracranial hemorrhages has increased, and death due to ischemic heart disease has remained consistently low over time.

568;Progresses in clinical studies on antiviral therapies for COVID‐19—Experience and lessons in design of clinical trials;10.1002/ped4.12227;Antiviral therapy with antiviral agents is a very important component of treatment for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). It is important to clarify how to evaluate efficacy and safety of antiviral agents in treatment of COVID‐19 during the pandemic of this disease. We need to answer the following questions: do we still need to use rigorously designed randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs)? Or, will it be enough if we use loosened criteria, observational studies or even retrospective case series and case reports? The answer is “No, we still need to use the strictly designed preferably blinded multicenter RCTs to evaluate the antiviral agents.” In this article, we reviewed almost all the RCT reports on monotherapies and combined therapies with antiviral agents for COVID‐19, and found that among the reports on monotherapies, only remdesivir, and among combined antiviral agents, only the combined regimen with interferon‐β1b, lopinavir‐ritonavir and ribavirin were effective and safe based on evidences from RCTs. The results of five RCTs for chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine consistently showed that they were ineffective and unsafe in the treatment of COVID‐19, especially at larger doses. Many aspects in the design of the clinical trials may be related to success or failure of a trial and the relevant factors need to be analyzed, discussed and emphasized from the specific requirements and considerations of antiviral therapies. We hope such discussions be of certain use in designing clinical trials for pediatric antiviral therapies.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33376954/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ped4.12227";28/12/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9065
569;Management of primary blast lung injury: a comparison of airway pressure release versus low tidal volume ventilation;10.1186/s40635-020-00314-2;BACKGROUND: Primary blast lung injury (PBLI) presents as a syndrome of respiratory distress and haemoptysis resulting from explosive shock wave exposure and is a frequent cause of mortality and morbidity in both military conflicts and terrorist attacks. The optimal mode of mechanical ventilation for managing PBLI is not currently known, and clinical trials in humans are impossible due to the sporadic and violent nature of the disease. METHODS: A high-fidelity multi-organ computational simulator of PBLI pathophysiology was configured to replicate data from 14 PBLI casualties from the conflict in Afghanistan. Adaptive and responsive ventilatory protocols implementing low tidal volume (LTV) ventilation and airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) were applied to each simulated patient for 24 h, allowing direct quantitative comparison of their effects on gas exchange, ventilatory parameters, haemodynamics, extravascular lung water and indices of ventilator-induced lung injury. RESULTS: The simulated patients responded well to both ventilation strategies. Post 24-h investigation period, the APRV arm had similar PF ratios (137 mmHg vs 157 mmHg), lower sub-injury threshold levels of mechanical power (11.9 J/min vs 20.7 J/min) and lower levels of extravascular lung water (501 ml vs 600 ml) compared to conventional LTV. Driving pressure was higher in the APRV group (11.9 cmH(2)O vs 8.6 cmH(2)O), but still significantly less than levels associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate use of APRV may offer casualties with PBLI important mortality-related benefits and should be considered for management of this challenging patient group.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309205/;23/06/2020;Primary blast lung injury;0.9607
570;Pedagogical foundations to online lectures in health professions education.;10.22605/rrh6038;Professional and tertiary health professions education (HPE) has been markedly challenged by the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Mandates for training organisations to reduce social contact during the global pandemic, and make learning available online, provide an opportunity for regional, rural and remote clinicians and students to more easily access learning and professional development opportunities. Online lectures, while posing an opportunity for regional, rural and remote HPE, entail potential risks. Educators who are familiar with face-to-face pedagogies may find a transition to remote, digital interaction unfamiliar, disarming, and therefore they may not design maximally engaging lectures. The strategies used in a face-to-face lecture cannot be directly transferred into the online environment. This article proposes strategies to ensure the ongoing effectiveness, efficiency and engagement of lectures transitioning from face-to-face to online delivery. Cognitive learning theory, strategies to promote learner engagement and minimise distraction, and examples of software affordances to support active learning during the lecture are proposed. This enables lecturers to navigate the challenges of lecturing in an online environment and plan fruitful online lectures during this disruptive time. These suggestions will therefore enable HPE to better meet the existing and future needs of regional, rural and remote learners who may not be able to easily access face-to-face learning upon the relaxation of social distancing measures. Strategies to provide equitable HPE to learners who cannot access plentiful, fast internet are also discussed.;"https://doi.org/10.22605/rrh6038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32466654/";01/05/2020;coronavirus;0.9894

Constant efforts at individual, national, and international level are being made in order to understand the genomics, hosts, modes of transmission and epidemiological link of nCoV-2019. As of now, whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already been decoded. Genomic characterization nCoV-2019 have shown close homology with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Structural analysis of the receptor binding site has confirmed that 2019-nCoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as human SARS virus. Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%). Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection. At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection. Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak.

Digital contact tracing, the Apple/Google API and big tech’s newfound role as global health policy makers;10.1007/s10676-020-09547-x;Since the outbreak of COVID-19, governments have turned their attention to digital contact tracing. In many countries, public debate has focused on the risks this technology poses to privacy, with advocates and experts sounding alarm bells about surveillance and mission creep reminiscent of the post 9/11 era. Yet, when Apple and Google launched their contact tracing API in April 2020, some of the world’s leading privacy experts applauded this initiative for its privacy-preserving technical specifications. In an interesting twist, the tech giants came to be portrayed as greater champions of privacy than some democratic governments. This article proposes to view the Apple/Google API in terms of a broader phenomenon whereby tech corporations are encroaching into ever new spheres of social life. From this perspective, the (legitimate) advantage these actors have accrued in the sphere of the production of digital goods provides them with (illegitimate) access to the spheres of health and medicine, and more worrisome, to the sphere of politics. These sphere transgressions raise numerous risks that are not captured by the focus on privacy harms. Namely, a crowding out of essential spherical expertise, new dependencies on corporate actors for the delivery of essential, public goods, the shaping of (global) public policy by non-representative, private actors and ultimately, the accumulation of decision-making power across multiple spheres. While privacy is certainly an important value, its centrality in the debate on digital contact tracing may blind us to these broader societal harms and unwittingly pave the way for ever more sphere transgressions.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837287/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-020-09547-x";18/07/2020;digital contact tracing;0.9077
573;Serum Vitamin D levels are associated with increased COVID-19 severity markers and mortality independent of visceral adiposity;10.1101/2021.03.12.21253490;INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Vitamin D (25-OHD) deficiency has been associated with susceptibility to infectious disease. In this study, the association between COVID-19 outcomes and 25-OHD levels in patients attending a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City are examined. METHODS: Consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. All patients underwent clinical evaluation (including outcomes), laboratory measurements (including 25-OHD) and a thoracic computerized tomography (including the measurement of epicardial fat thickness). Low vitamin D was defined as levels <20ng/mL (<50nmol/L) and severely low (or deficient) 25-OHD as a level [≤]12ng/mL (<30nmol/L) RESULTS: Of the 551 patients included, low 25-OHD levels were present in 45.6% and severely low levels in 10.9%. Severely low 25-OHD levels were associated with mortality (HR 2.11, 95%CI 1.24-3.58, p=0.006) but not with critical COVID-19 (OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.94-0.99, p=0.042), adjusted for age, sex, body-mass index and epicardial fat. Using model-based causal mediation analyses the increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by 25-OHD levels was partly mediated by its effect on D-dimer and cardiac ultrasensitive troponins. Notably, increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by low vitamin D levels was independent of BMI and epicardial fat. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency ([≤]12ng/mL or <30nmol/L), is independently associated with COVID-19 mortality after adjustment for visceral fat (epicardial fat thickness). Low 25-OHD may contribute to a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state, increasing the risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253490v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.12.21253490";13/03/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9014
574;Clinical evidence based review and recommendations of aerosol generating medical procedures in otolaryngology – head and neck surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic;10.1186/s40463-020-00425-6;BACKGROUND: Aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) present risks to health care workers (HCW) due to airborne transmission of pathogens. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential for HCWs to recognize which procedures are potentially aerosolizing so that appropriate infection prevention precautions can be taken. The aim of this literature review was to identify potential AGMPs in Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and provide evidence-based recommendations. METHODS: A literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane Review databases up to April 3, 2020. All titles and abstracts of retrieved studies were evaluated and all studies mentioning potential AGMPs were included for formal review. Full text of included studies were assessed by two reviewers and the quality of the studies was evaluated. Ten categories of potential AGMPs were developed and recommendations were provided for each category. RESULTS: Direct evidence indicates that CO2 laser ablation, the use of high-speed rotating devices, electrocautery and endotracheal suctioning are AGMPs. Indirect evidence indicates that tracheostomy should be considered as potential AGMPs. Nasal endoscopy and nasal packing/epistaxis management can result in droplet transmission, but it is unknown if these procedures also carry the risk of airborne transmission. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, special care should be taken when CO2 lasers, electrocautery and high-speed rotating devices are used in potentially infected tissue. Tracheal procedures like tracheostomy and endotracheal suctioning can also result in airborne transmission via small virus containing aerosols.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32375884/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40463-020-00425-6";06/05/2020;Aerosol generating medical procedures;0.9251
575;A computational study on active constituents of Habb-ul-aas and Tabasheer as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease.;10.1080/07391102.2021.1900920;A respiratory pandemic known as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has created havoc since it emerged from Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is caused by a newly emerged SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with increased pathogenicity named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the lack of understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis, an effective therapeutic option is unavailable. Epidemics described in Unani ancient literature include nazla-e-wabai and humma-e-wabai, and most of the symptoms of COVID-19 resemble nazla-e-wabai. Hence, in light of Unani literature, the treatment of COVID-19 can be managed with the composites prescribed in Unani medicine for nazla-e-wabai. In this study, a structure-based drug design approach was carried out to check the effectiveness of the pharmacologically active constituents of the Unani composites prescribed to treat nazla-e-wabai against SARS-CoV-2. We performed molecular docking of the active constituents of these composites against the main protease (Mpro), a potential drug target in SARS-CoV-2. Using detailed molecular docking analysis, Habb-ul-aas and Tabasheer were identified as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The active constituents of both these composites bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, forming interactions with key residues of the binding pocket. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation suggested the binding of active constituents of Habb-ul-aas with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a strong affinity as compared to the constituents of Tabasheer. Thus, this study sheds light on the use of these Unani composites in COVID-19 therapeutics.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

576;Nanobodies from camelid mice and llamas neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants.;10.1038/s41586-021-03676-z;"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of deaths worldwide. While many vaccines have been deployed to date, the continual evolution of the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) has challenged their efficacy. In particular, emerging variants B.1.1.7 (U.K.), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil) have compromised convalescent sera and immunotherapies that received emergency use authorization1-3. One potential alternative to avert viral escape is the use of camelid VHHs or nanobodies, which can recognize epitopes often inaccessible to conventional antibodies4. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and ""nanomice"" we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and camels. We identified two sets of highly neutralizing nanobodies. Group 1 circumvents antigenic drift by recognizing an RBD region that is highly conserved in coronaviruses but rarely targeted by human antibodies. Group 2 is almost exclusively focused to the RBD-ACE2 interface and fails to neutralize variants carrying E484K or N501Y substitutions. Notably however, group 2 nanobodies retain full neutralization activity against variants when expressed as homotrimers, rivaling the most potent antibodies produced to date against SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2 binding domain, and recognition of conserved epitopes largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, while new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised.";"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03676-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34098567/";07/06/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.9036
577;The landscape of lung bronchoalveolar immune cells in COVID-19 revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing;10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690;"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, etiological agent of recently named Coronavirus infected disease (COVID-19) by WHO, has caused more than 2, 000 deaths worldwide since its emergency in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, in December, 2019. The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19.

578;Experiences of Indian Council of Medical Research with tick-borne zoonotic infections: Kyasanur Forest disease & Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in India with One Health focus;10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_532_21;Emergence and re-emergence of several pathogens have been witnessed by this century in the form of outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. In India, the influencing factor that promotes dissemination of emerging and re-emerging viral infections is the biogeographical zones: a megadiverse country, characterized by varied geographical, climatic conditions and ever-changing socio-economical and geopolitical issues. These influence the movement of humans and animals and add layers of complexity for the identification and timely management of infectious diseases. This review focuses on two tick-borne infections: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and Kyasanur forest disease (KFD). In the last two decades, these viruses have emerged and caused outbreaks in different parts of India. KFD virus was initially identified in 1957 and was known to be endemic in Karnataka State while CCHF virus was first identified during 2010 in Gujarat State, India. These viruses have managed to emerge in new areas within the last decade. With changing epidemiology of these arboviruses, there is a probability of the emergence of these viruses from new areas in future. The investigations on these two diseases under the One Health focus involved early detection, quickly developing diagnostic tools, identifying stakeholders, capacity building by developing collaboration with major stakeholders to understand the epidemiology and geographical spread in domestic animal reservoirs and tick vectors in the affected areas, developing laboratory network, providing diagnostic reagents and biosafety and laboratory diagnosis training to the network laboratories to control these diseases.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8204825/;05/03/2021;Kyasanur forest disease;0.9176
579;Clinical stability and in-hospital mortality prediction in COVID-19 patients presenting to the Emergency Department.;10.23736/s0026-4806.20.07074-3;BACKGROUND The Novara-COVID score was developed to help the Emergency Physician to decide which Coronavirus disease (COVID) patient required hospitalization at emergency department (ED) presentation and to which intensity of care. We aimed at evaluating its prognostic role. METHODS We retrospectively collected data of COVID patients admitted to our ED between March 16th and April 22nd, 2020. The Novara-COVID score was systematically applied to all COVID patients since its introduction in clinical practice and adopted to decide patients' destination. The ability of the Novara-COVID score to predict in-hospital clinical stability and in-hospital mortality were evaluated through multivariable logistic regression and Cox Regression Hazard models, respectively. RESULTS Among the 480 COVID patients admitted to the ED, 338 were hospitalized: the Novara-COVID score was 0-1 in 49.7%, 2 in 24.6%, 3 in 15.4% and 4-5 in 10.3% of patients. Novara-COVID score values of 3 and 4-5 were associated with lower clinical stability with adjusted odds ratios of 0.28 [0.13-0.59] and 0.03 [0.01-0.12], respectively. When in-hospital mortality was evaluated, a significant difference emerged between scores of 0-1 and 2 vs. 3 and 4-5. In particular, the death adjusted Hazard Ratio for Novara-COVID scores of 3 and 4-5 were 2.6 [1.4-4.8] and 8.4 [4.7-15.2], respectively. CONCLUSIONS The Novara-COVID score reliably predicts in-hospital clinical instability and mortality of COVID patients at ED presentation.

580;Advancement in biosensors for inflammatory biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 during 2019–2020;10.1016/j.bios.2020.112703;COVID-19 pandemic has affected everyone throughout the world and has resulted in the loss of lives of many souls. Due to the restless efforts of the researchers working hard day and night, some success has been gained for the detection of virus. As on date, the traditional polymerized chain reactions (PCR), lateral flow devices (LFID) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are being adapted for the detection of this deadly virus. However, a more exciting avenue is the detection of certain biomarkers associated with this viral infection which can be done by simply re-purposing our existing infrastructure. SARS-CoV-2 viral infection triggers various inflammatory, biochemical and hematological biomarkers. Because of the infection route that the virus follows, it causes significant inflammatory response. As a result, various inflammatory markers have been reported to be closely associated with this infection such as C-reactive proteins, interleukin-6, procalcitonin and ferritin. Sensing of these biomarkers can simultaneously help in understanding the illness level of the affected patient. Also, by monitoring these biomarkers, we can predict the viral infections in those patients who have low SARS-CoV-2 RNA and hence are missed by traditional tests. This can give more targets to the researchers and scientists, working in the area of drug development and provide better prognosis. In this review, we propose to highlight the conventional as well as the non-conventional methods for the detection of these inflammatory biomarkers which can act as a single platform of knowledge for the researchers and scientists working for the treatment of COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112703; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566320306928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33049563/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566320306928?v=s5";01/01/2021;lateral flow devices;0.9869
581;Propensity and quantification of aerosol and droplet creation during phacoemulsification with high-speed shadowgraphy amidst COVID-19 pandemic.;10.1097/j.jcrs.0000000000000289;PURPOSE To study propensity of aerosol and droplet generation during phacoemulsification using high-speed shadowgraphy and quantify its spread amidst COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING Aerosol and droplet quantification laboratory DESIGN:: Laboratory study. METHODS In an experimental set up, phacoemulsification was performed on enucleated goat eyes and cadaveric human corneo-scleral rims mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Standard settings for sculpt and quadrant removal mode were used on Visalis 100 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany). Microincision and standard phacoemulsification were done using titanium straight tips (2.2 and 2.8 mm in diameter). The main wound incisions were titrated equal to and larger than the sleeve size. High speed shadowgraphy technique was used to detect the possible generation of any droplets and aerosols. The visualization and quantification of size of the aerosols and droplets along with calculation of their spread were the main outcome measures. RESULTS In longitudinal phacoemulsification using a peristaltic pump device with a straight tip, no aerosol generation was seen in a closed chamber. In larger wounds, there was a slow leak at the main wound. The atomization of balanced salt solution was observed only when the phaco tip was completely exposed next to the ocular surface. Under this condition, the nominal size of the droplet was ∼ 50 µm and the maximum calculated spread was 1.3 meters. CONCLUSIONS There was no visible aerosol generation during microincision or standard phacoemulsification. Phacoemulsification is safe to perform in the COVID-19 era by taking adequate precautions against other modes of transmission.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/j.jcrs.0000000000000289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32649436/";06/07/2020;Phacoemulsification;0.9509

This study seeks to analyse the efficacy and safety of DPIA in bronchiectasis patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Multi-centre study of historic cohorts. All the hospital centres in Spain were contacted in order to collect data on patients with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis who had taken at least one dose of DPIA. Its efficacy was analysed in clinical, functional and microbiological terms by comparing the year before and the year after the prescription of DPIA. Adverse effects and variables associated with these effects, or any need to withdraw the drug, were also analysed. RESULTS 164 patients from 33 Spanish centres were included; 86% and 14% of these were treated with dry powder colistin and tobramycin, respectively. Chronic bronchial infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present in 86% of these patients, and DPIA significantly reduced the number of exacerbations, the quantity and purulence of sputum and the isolation of pathogenic microorganisms. The most common adverse effect was cough (40%), particularly in cases of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and a previous cough and in those patients who had difficulties in handling the device. These factors were associated with a higher level of withdrawal of the treatment. There were no serious adverse effects.

584;Depending on your own kindness: The moderating role of self-compassion on the within-person consequences of work loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic.;10.1037/ocp0000271;The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has transformed the way we work, with many employees working under isolating and difficult conditions. However, research on the antecedents, consequences, and buffers of work loneliness is scarce. Integrating research on need for belonging, regulatory loop models of loneliness, and self-compassion, the current study addresses this critical issue by developing and testing a conceptual model that highlights how COVID-related stressors frustrate employees' need for belonging (i.e., telecommuting frequency, job insecurity, and a lack of COVID-related informational justice), negatively impacting worker well-being (i.e., depression) and helping behaviors [i.e., organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)] through work loneliness. Furthermore, we examine the buffering role of self-compassion in this process. Results from a weekly diary study of U.S. employees conducted over 2 months during the initial stage of the pandemic provide support for the mediating role of work loneliness in relations between all three proposed antecedents and both outcomes. In addition, self-compassion mitigated the positive within-person relationship between work loneliness and employee depression, indicating that more self-compassionate employees were better able to cope with their feelings of work loneliness. Although self-compassion also moderated the within-person relationship between work loneliness and OCB, this interaction was different in form from our prediction. Implications for enhancing employee well-being and helping behaviors during and beyond the pandemic are discussed.

Remdesivir (RDV) has shown some promising results in coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) albeit with low certainty. Data in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are still lacking. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of 57 moderate to severe COVID‐19 positive KTR in a single center who received RDV as a part of COVID‐19 management. No dose adjustments were done. The outcomes were measured as acute kidney injury (AKI) recovery; liver function tests abnormalities; other side effects; graft loss and death. RESULTS: The median (inter‐quartile range) age of presentation was 44 (31‐51) years. The duration from onset of symptoms to RDV initiation was 6 (5‐7) days. Thirty‐two (56%) cases received RDV on the day of admission. Forty‐six (81%) cases were on oxygen support upon initiation of RDV. Thirty‐eight (66.6%) cases had acute kidney injury on admission. The median baseline, admission, and 28‐day follow‐up serum creatinine of the cohort were 1.59 (1.1‐2.1), 2.13 (1.3‐3.1), and 1.58 (1.05‐2.1) mg/dl, respectively. A total of 8(14%) cases died in the study with 1 (1.7%) graft loss. All those cases that died were on oxygen therapy at the time of initiation of RDV.

This review provides an overview of the underlying immune profile of COVID-19-related CRS as well as laboratory markers for acute diagnosis and chronic follow-up of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and CRS. Areas covered: Innate and acquired immune profiles in COVID-19-CRS, RNA-detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of CRS including factors that affect assay performance, serology for SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of CRS, and other biomarkers for COVID-19 will be discussed. Expert opinion: Studies support the implication of CRS in the pathogenesis, clinical severity and outcome of COVID-19 through the elevated production of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from activated innate and adaptive immune cells. Although these inflammatory molecules, including IL-6, IL-2R, IL-10, IP-10 and MCP-1, often correlate with disease severity as the possible biomarkers, the pathogenic contributions of individual molecules and the therapeutic benefits of targeting them are yet to be demonstrated. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is the gold standard method for diagnosis of COVID-19 in the context of CRS but assay performance varies and is susceptible to false negative results even as patients clinically deteriorate due to decreased viral shedding in the setting of CRS. Biomarkers including CRP, ferritin, D-dimer and procalcitonin may provide early clues about progression to CRS and help identify thrombotic and infectious complications of COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/14737159.2020.1830760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32990479/";29/09/2020;INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease;0.959

Nursing education must respond to these changing times by redesigning classroom instruction. Flipped learning (FL) is a proposed method for teaching advanced practice nurses that is student-centered and engaging, both critical areas for contemporary learners. This qualitative study explored the perspectives and experiences of the family nurse practitioner faculty and the family nurse practitioner nursing students who participated in FL. The type and level of FL practices faculty can apply to support students coming to class prepared to engage in active learning activities was also investigated. The study used an insider action research design. There were two arms of the study, faculty and student. Ten faculty-led learning circles with four faculty and three family nurse practitioner student focus groups, each with six students, were held over the course of the study. Thematic findings were developed from both student and faculty data. The results revealed that family nurse practitioner students had a positive attitude toward FL. Many expressed FL provided perceptions of gained confidence, personalized learning, increased engagement, and preparedness for classroom instruction. Overall, faculty preferred FL over traditional teaching approaches. Several active learning activities were used by faculty with clinical case studies being the most preferred by student participants. This study confirms FL is a plausible and promising approach to traditional classroom instruction. However, more robust studies are needed to determine its benefits in advanced practice nursing education.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/jxx.0000000000000581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33731552/";12/03/2021;coronavirus;0.9512

Retrospective analysis of 258 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to the Tel Aviv Medical Center, of which, 131 during the first peak (March 21–May 30, 2020) and 127 during the second peak (May 31–July 16, 2020). First and second peak patients did not differ in baseline characteristics and clinical presentation at admission. Treatment with dexamethasone, full-dose anticoagulation, tocilizumab, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma transfusion were significantly more frequent during the second peak, as well as regimens combining 3–4 COVID-19-directed drugs. Compared to the first peak, 30-day mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation rates as well as adjusted risk were significantly lower during the second peak (10.2%, vs 19.8% vs p = 0.028, adjusted HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19–0.79, p = 0.009 and 8.8% vs 19.3%, p = 0.002, adjusted HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13–0.64, p = 0.002; respectively). Rates of 30-day mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation, as well as adjusted risks, were lower in the second peak of the COVID-19 pandemic among hospitalized patients. The change in treatment strategy and the experienced gained during the first peak may have contributed to the improved outcomes.

589;The impact of physical distancing measures against COVID-19 transmission on contacts and mixing patterns in the Netherlands: repeated cross-sectional surveys;10.1101/2020.05.18.20101501;Background During the current pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) many countries have taken drastic measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV2. The measures often include physical distancing that aims to reduce the number of contacts in the population. Little is known about the actual reduction in number of contacts as a consequence of physical distancing measures. Methods In the Netherlands, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2016/2017 in which 8179 participants retrospectively reported the number, age and gender of different persons they had contacted (spoken to in person or touched) during the previous day. The survey was repeated among 2830 of the original participants, using the same questionnaire, in March and April 2020 after physical distancing measures had been implemented. Results The average number of contacts in the community was reduced from on average 12.5 (interquartile range: 2-17) to 3.7 (interquartile range: 0-4) different persons per participant, a reduction of 71% (95% confidence interval: 71-71). The reduction in the number of community contacts was highest for children and adolescents (between 5 and 20 years) and smallest for elderly persons of 80 years and older. The reduction in the effective number of total contacts, measured as the largest eigenvalue of the matrix with community and household contacts, was 62% (95% confidence interval: 48 - 72). Conclusion The substantial reduction in contacts has contributed greatly in halting the COVID-19 epidemic. This reduction was unevenly distributed over age groups, household sizes and occupations. These findings offer guidance for the lifting of age-group targeted measures.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.18.20101501v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.18.20101501";20/05/2020;coronavirus;0.9239
590;P2Y14 Receptor as a Target for Neutrophilia Attenuation in Severe COVID-19 Cases: From Hematopoietic Stem Cell Recruitment and Chemotaxis to Thrombo‐inflammation;10.1007/s12015-021-10129-7;The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic starting in 2019 has already reached more than 2.3 million deaths. Despite the scientific community’s efforts to investigate the COVID-19 disease, a drug for effectively treating or curing patients yet needs to be discovered. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) differentiating into immune cells for defense express COVID-19 entry receptors, and COVID-19 infection hinders their differentiation. The importance of purinergic signaling in HSC differentiation and innate immunity has been recognized. The metabotropic P2Y14 receptor subtype, activated by UDP-glucose, controls HSC differentiation and mobilization. Thereon, the exacerbated activation of blood immune cells amplifies the inflammatory state observed in COVID-19 patients, specially through the continuous release of reactive oxygen species and extracellular neutrophil traps (NETs). Further, the P2Y14 subtype, robustly inhibits the infiltration of neutrophils into various epithelial tissues, including lungs and kidneys. Here we discuss findings suggesting that antagonism of the P2Y14 receptor could prevent the progression of COVID-19-induced systemic inflammation, which often leads to severe illness and death cases. Considering the modulation of neutrophil recruitment of extreme relevance for respiratory distress and lung failure prevention, we propose that P2Y14 receptor inhibition by its selective antagonist PPTN could limit neutrophil recruitment and NETosis, hence limiting excessive formation of oxygen reactive species and proteolytic activation of the kallikrein-kinin system and subsequent bradykinin storm in the alveolar septa of COVID-19 patients.

591;Case report: a man with untreated rheumatoid arthritis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, membranous nephropathy and pulmonary sarcoidosis;10.1186/s12882-020-02161-5;BACKGROUND: Glomerular involvement in rheumatoid arthritis has been known to be associated with treatment side effects from medications and secondary amyloidosis. However, limited basic science and clinical studies have been performed to address the potential disease specific immune-mediated mechanisms causing secondary glomerular pathology, its various types of presentation, and the potential treatments. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old man with chronic active rheumatoid arthritis presented with nephrotic syndrome and was found to have membranous nephropathy with eosinophilic intracapillary thrombi on renal biopsy. Proteinuria persisted despite complete withdrawal from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Throughout the disease course, he developed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and pulmonary sarcoidosis, both of which achieved clinical resolution with glucocorticoids. However, only partial improvement was observed in proteinuria with treatment of steroids and Rituximab. CONCLUSION: Our case presented a unique and complicated clinical phenotype of active rheumatoid arthritis, with clinical features of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, histopathologic features of membranous and cryoglobulinemic nephropathy in the absence of DMARDs use, as well as pulmonary sarcoidosis. We speculate that there is a wider spectrum of glomerular disease in patients with untreated rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the potential association between rheumatoid arthritis and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis should probably be revisited and requires further studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and treatment options.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33213411/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-020-02161-5";19/11/2020;Glomerular involvement in rheumatoid arthritis;0.9301
592;A three-arm, multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine and low-dose prednisone to treat recurrent pregnancy loss in women with undifferentiated connective tissue diseases: protocol for the Immunosuppressant regimens for LIving FEtuses (ILIFE) trial.;10.1186/s13063-020-04716-1;BACKGROUND Undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) is known to induce adverse pregnancy outcomes and even recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) by placental vascular damage and inflammation activation. Anticoagulation can prevent pregnancy morbidities. However, it is unknown whether the addition of immune suppressants to anticoagulation can prevent spontaneous pregnancy loss in UCTD patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and low-dose prednisone on recurrent pregnancy loss for women with UCTD. METHODS The Immunosuppressant for Living Fetuses (ILIFE) Trial is a three-arm, multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial with the primary objective of comparing hydroxychloroquine combined with low-dose prednisone and anticoagulation with anticoagulation alone in treating UCTD women with recurrent spontaneous abortion. The third arm of using hydroxychloroquine combined with anticoagulant for secondary comparison. A total of 426 eligible patients will be randomly assigned to each of the three arms with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcome is the rate of live births. Secondary outcomes include adverse pregnancy outcomes and progression of UCTD. DISCUSSION This is the first multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial which evaluates the efficacy of immunosuppressant regimens on pregnancy outcomes and UCTD progression. It will provide evidence on whether the immunosuppressant ameliorates the pregnancy prognosis in UCTD patients with RSA and the progression into defined connective tissue disease.

593;Assessing the risk of recurrence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in affected farms on Jeju Island, South Korea.;10.4142/jvs.2021.22.e48;"BACKGROUND Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that has devastated the swine industry in South Korea over the last 30 years. The lack of an effective method to control the endemics has led to a surge in PEDV recurrences in affected farms throughout the country. OBJECTIVES In the first step toward establishing systematic monitoring of and active control measures over the swine populations, we constructed an assessment model that evaluates the status of (1) biosecurity, (2) herd immunity, and (3) virus circulation in each of the PEDV-infected farms. METHODS A total of 13 farrow-to-finish pig farms with a history of acute PEDV infection on Jeju Island were chosen for this study. The potential risk of the recurrence in these farms was estimated through on-site data collection and laboratory examination. RESULTS Overall, the data indicated that a considerable number of the PEDV-infected farms had lax biosecurity, achieved incomplete protective immunity in the sows despite multi-dose vaccination, and served as incubators of the circulating virus; thus, they face an increased risk of recurrent outbreaks. Intriguingly, our results suggest that after an outbreak, a farm requires proactive tasks, including reinforcing biosecurity, conducting serological and virus monitoring to check the sows' immunity and to identify the animals exposed to PEDV, and improving the vaccination scheme and disinfection practices if needed. CONCLUSIONS The present study highlights the significance of coordinated PEDV management in infected farms to reduce the risk of recurrence and further contribute towards the national eradication of PEDV.";"https://doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2021.22.e48; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34170089/";01/06/2021;vaccination;0.9129
594;Identifying and quantifying robust risk factors for mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 using quantile regression;10.1016/j.ajem.2020.08.090;"OBJECTIVE: Many laboratory indicators form a skewed distribution with outliers in critically ill patients with COVID-19, for which robust methods are needed to precisely determine and quantify fatality risk factors. METHOD: A total of 192 critically ill patients (142 were discharged and 50 died in the hospital) with COVID-19 were included in the sample. Quantile regression was used to determine discrepant laboratory indexes between survivors and non-survivors and quantile shift (QS) was used to quantify the difference. Logistic regression was then used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and the predictive power of death for each risk indicator. RESULTS: After adjusting for multiple comparisons and controlling numerous confounders, quantile regression revealed that the laboratory indexes of non-survivors were significantly higher in C-reactive protein (CRP; QS = 0.835, p < .001), white blood cell counts (WBC; QS = 0.743, p < .001), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST; QS = 0.735, p < .001), blood glucose (BG; QS = 0.608, p = .059), fibrin degradation product (FDP; QS = 0.730, p = .080), and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO(2)), and lower in oxygen saturation (SO(2); QS = 0.312, p < .001), calcium (Ca(2+); QS = 0.306, p = .073), and pH. Most of these indexes were associated with an increased fatality risk, and predictive for the probability of death. Especially, CRP is the most prominent index with and odds ratio of 205.97 and predictive accuracy of 93.2%.

595;COVIDGR dataset and COVID-SDNet methodology for predicting COVID-19 based on Chest X-Ray images.;10.1109/jbhi.2020.3037127;Currently, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), one of the most infectious diseases in the 21st century, is diagnosed using RT-PCR testing, CT scans and/or Chest X-Ray (CXR) images. CT (Computed Tomography) scanners and RT-PCR testing are not available in most medical centers and hence in many cases CXR images become the most time/cost effective tool for assisting clinicians in making decisions. Deep learning neural networks have a great potential for building COVID-19 triage systems and detecting COVID-19 patients, especially patients with low severity. Unfortunately, current databases do not allow building such systems as they are highly heterogeneous and biased towards severe cases. This paper is threefold: (i) we demystify the high sensitivities achieved by most recent COVID-19 classification models, (ii) under a close collaboration with Hospital Universitario Clnico San Cecilio, Granada, Spain, we built COVIDGR-1.0, a homogeneous and balanced database that includes all levels of severity, from normal with Positive RT-PCR, Mild, Moderate to Severe. COVIDGR-1.0 contains 426 positive and 426 negative PA (PosteroAnterior) CXR views and (iii) we propose COVID Smart Data based Network (COVID-SDNet) methodology for improving the generalization capacity of COVID-classification models. Our approach reaches good and stable results with an accuracy of 97.72% 0.95%, 86.90% 3.20%, 61.80% 5.49% in severe, moderate and mild COVID-19 severity levels.

596;A Novel Ticket System for Capping Residency Interview Numbers: Reimagining Interviews in the COVID-19 Era.;10.1097/acm.0000000000003745;"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to dramatic changes in the 2020 residency application cycle, including halting away rotations and delaying the application timeline. These stressors are laid on top of a resident selection process already under duress with exploding application and interview numbers-the latter likely to be exacerbated with the widespread shift to virtual interviewing. Leveraging their trainee perspective, the authors propose enforcing a cap on the number of interviews that applicants may attend through a novel interview ticket system (ITS). Specialties electing to participate in the ITS would select an evidence-based, specialty-specific interview cap. Applicants would then receive unique electronic tickets-equal in number to the cap-that would be given to participating programs at the time of an interview, when the tickets would be marked as used. The system would be self-enforcing and would ensure each interview represents genuine interest between applicant and program, while potentially increasing the number of interviews-and thus match rate-for less competitive applicants. Limitations of the ITS and alternative approaches for interview capping, including an honor code system, are also discussed. Finally, in the context of capped interview numbers, the authors emphasize the need for transparent pre-interview data from programs to inform applicants and their advisors on which interviews to attend; learning from prior experiences and studies on virtual interviewing; adherence to best practices for interviewing; and careful consideration of how virtual interviews may shift inequities in the resident selection process.";"https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32910007/";08/09/2020;coronavirus;0.9588

This study aimed to investigate the mental health status and associated factors among residents of Pakistan. An online questionnaire survey was conducted from April 3 to May 7, 2020, using convenience and snowball sampling techniques. Data regarding demographics, physical health status and contact history during the last 2 weeks were collected.

598;ESPGHAN 'biopsy-sparing' guidelines for celiac disease in children with low antitransglutaminase during COVID-19.;10.1097/meg.0000000000001924;"OBJECTIVES Recent guidelines for celiac disease have allowed a biopsy-free approach in endomysial antibodies (EMAs) positive children with high antitransglutaminase (TGA-IgA) titer [>10 time upper limit of normal (ULN)]. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is still necessary for diagnosis in children with lower title. Because elective pediatric endoscopy has been substantially shouted down during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, many children remained undiagnosed - and therefore untreated - for a long time. We aimed to analyze the feasibility and accuracy of a biopsy-free approach in suspected celiac disease children with TGA-IgA values <10 ULN to facilitate the diagnostic process by avoiding endoscopy. METHODS In this study cohort, we retrospectively analyzed all biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease in our center (between 2014 and 2019). The positive predictive value (PPV) of TGA-IgA titers between 5 and 10 ULN and positive EMA in diagnosing celiac disease were determined. Mucosal atrophy and resolution of symptoms after gluten-free diet (GFD) were considered to confirm initial diagnosis. RESULTS Of 430 celiac disease patients (F: 274; mean age 7.54 years) diagnosed by endoscopy, 84 (F: 46; mean age 8 years) with TGA-IgA between 5 and 10 ULN and positive EMA were identified. The PPV of TGA-IgA between 5 and 10 ULN and positive EMA was 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.90-0.96). All these children had a symptom resolution and antibodies normalization after GFD.

599;Epidemiology of the 2020 pandemic of COVID‐19 in the state of Georgia: Inadequate critical care resources and impact after 7 weeks of community spread;10.1002/emp2.12127;"OBJECTIVES: Novel coronavirus (COVID‐19) is a global pandemic currently spreading rapidly across the United States. We provide a comprehensive look at COVID‐19 epidemiology across the state of Georgia, which includes vast rural communities that may be disproportionately impacted by the spread of this infectious disease. METHODS: All 159 Georgia counties were included in this study. We examined the geographic variation of COVID‐19 in Georgia from March 3 through April 24, 2020 by extracting data on incidence and mortality from various national and state datasets. We contrasted county‐level mortality rates per 100,000 population (MRs) by county‐level factors. RESULTS: Metropolitan Atlanta had the overall highest number of confirmed cases; however, the southwestern rural parts of Georgia, surrounding the city of Albany, had the highest bi‐weekly increases in incidence rate. Among counties with >10 cases, MRs were highest in the rural counties of Randolph (233.2), Terrell (182.5), Early (136.3), and Dougherty (114.2). Counties with the highest MRs (22.5–2332 per 100,000) had a higher proportion of: non‐Hispanic Blacks residents, adults aged 60+, adults earning <$20,000 annually, and residents living in rural communities when compared with counties with lower MRs. These counties also had a lower proportion of the population with a college education, lower number of ICU beds per 100,000 population, and lower number of primary care physicians per 10,000 population.

600;H″IT″ting the Barriers for Exercising during Social Isolation;10.3390/biology9090245;Aerobic exercise is traditionally recommended to improve general health and prevent many non-communicable diseases. However, the measures adopted to control the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak culminated with closing of exercise facilities and fitness centers and, as a primary consequence, impaired aerobic exercise practice. This contributed to an increase in risk factors associated with physical inactivity such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, low-grade inflammation, weight gain, and mental health problems. The scenario is worrisome, and it is important to propose alternatives for exercise practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interval training (IT) emerges as an exercise mode that might be feasible, low-cost, and potentially safe to be performed in many different places. IT consists of interspersing relative brief bouts of high-intensity exercise with recovery periods and promotes similar or greater health benefits when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Among the different types of IT, sprint interval training and “Tabata protocols” might be particularly useful during social isolation. These protocols can be controlled and performed without the need of complex equipment and can be adapted to different places, including domestic environments. In this article, we present variations of IT as possible alternatives to cope physical inactivity during COVID-19 pandemics with a focus on its practical applications. The protocols suggested can be performed without the need of specialized equipment or facilities, in a time-efficient manner, and aiming to prevent detraining or even improve physical fitness and general health.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9090245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847134/";24/08/2020;Coronavirus;0.9703

Although it has been described more than 100 years ago, the literature is limited to small retrospective studies. This study aimed to follow patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that developed PM during hospitalization and describe their clinical and radiological evolution. METHODS A prospective cohort was developed with patients with PM, excluding those with aerodigestive trauma, inside a hospital COVID-19 dedicated hospital. Clinical variables including onset of symptoms, hemodynamic instability, associated complications, the need of interventions, and disease course were all recorded. Also, radiological findings such as the presence of the Macklin effect, extension of lung involvement by COVID-19, and characteristics of the PM were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-one patients with non-traumatic PM were followed, resulting in an overall incidence of 0.5% during the study period. Seven (33%) patients had associated pneumothorax and malignant/tension PM was observed in three (14%) cases. The Macklin effect could be found in 11 patients (52%) and the majority of them had more than 50% of lung involvement due to COVID-19. The mortality rate was 49%; however, no deaths were directly related to the PM. CONCLUSIONS PM incidence is probably increased in the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19, especially in those with greater involvement of the lungs, and the Macklin effect may be an important underlying mechanism of this complication.

602;Heparin as an Anti-Inflammatory Agent;10.1101/2020.07.29.223859;Timely control of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) at the severe stage of COVID-19 is key to improving the treatment success and reducing the mortality rate. The inhibition of the activity of the two key cytokines, IFNγ and IL-6, can significantly reduce or even reverse the development of the cytokine storm. The objective of our investigations is to reveal the anti-inflammatory potential of heparin for prevention and suppression of the development of CRS in acute COVID-19 patients. The effect of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on IFNγ signalling inside the stimulated WISH cells was investigated by measuring its antiproliferative activity and the translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 in the nucleus. The mechanism of heparin binding to IFNγ and IL-6 and therefore inhibition of their activity was studied by means of extensive molecular-dynamics simulations. We find that LMWH binds with high affinity to IFNγ and is able to inhibit fully the interaction with its cellular receptor. It also influences the biological activity of IL-6 by binding to either IL-6 or IL-6/IL-6Rα thus preventing the formation of the IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 signaling complex. Our conclusion is that heparin is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that can be used in acute inflammatory conditions, due to its potential to inhibit both IFN γ and IL-6 signalling pathways. Based on our results and available clinical observations, we suggest the administration of LMWH to COVID-19 patients in the initial stages of the acute phase. The beginning of the treatment and the dosage should be based on a careful follow-up of the platelet count and the D-dimer, IL-6, IFN, T-cells, and B-cells levels.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.29.223859;29/07/2020;LMWH;0.9368
603;Tuberculosis in Critical Care;10.1007/978-981-15-4039-4_16;"Although tuberculosis (TB) figures among the top 10 causes of mortality globally, it is rather infrequently encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting even in countries where TB is widely prevalent. Patients with TB constitute less than 2% of total ICU admissions (Muthu et al. 2018; Frame et al. 1987). Notwithstanding, these patients pose considerable challenges in terms of timely diagnosis, treatment, and infection control. Patients with clinically severe forms of TB may require admission to the ICU. Studies from various settings indicate that a broad range of 1–25% of patients with active TB require ICU admission (Patel et al. 2017; Tsai et al. 2008; Levy et al. 1987; Lui et al. 2014; Eveloff et al. 1994; Rao et al. 1998; Silva et al. 2010). The most common reason for transferring a patient with active TB to the ICU is acute respiratory failure (ARF) (Muthu et al. 2018; Frame et al. 1987; Zahar et al. 2001; Valade et al. 2012). Other common indications include mycobacterial septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). However, in some settings, TB meningitis is the most common reason for ICU admission among TB patients. About 40% of patients with TB meningitis would have concomitant pulmonary disease. Less common indications could be massive hemoptysis, pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade, Addisonian crisis, airway obstruction in laryngeal TB, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and seizures caused by tuberculomas in the brain. Importantly, TB patients may also experience acute liver failure due to hepatotoxic drugs and rarely acute renal failure, mainly rifampicin-induced (Hagan and Nathani 2013) (Table 16.1).";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979070/;01/08/2020;multiorgan dysfunction syndrome;0.907
604;TPPP3 Associated with Prognosis and Immune Infiltrates in Head and Neck Squamous Carcinoma.;10.1155/2020/3962146;"Tubulin polymerization promoting protein family member 3 (TPPP3) is a kind of protein that can mediate the dynamics and stability of microtubules. However, the correlations of TPPP3 between prognosis and immune infiltrates in different tumors are still unclear. The analysis of TPPP3 expression was performed via Oncomine and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) website. We also used GEPIA to assess the impact of TPPPT3 on clinical outcomes. The related pathways involved in TPPP3 were analyzed by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and the correlation between TPPP3 and immune infiltration was studied by Tumor Immune Estimation Resource2.0 (TIMER 2.0). The TPPP3 expression was significantly reduced in head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) compared to adjacent tissues. In addition, the low expression of TPPP3 in HNSC was significantly associated with prognosis. The pathways closely related to the low expression of TPPP3 are ""Antigen Processing and Presentation,"" ""Primary Immunodeficiency,"" and so on. The TPPP3 expression was negatively correlated with the level of CD8+ T cell, B cell, and myeloid dendritic cell infiltration in HNSC. The TPPP3 expression is closely related to multiple immunomarkers in CD8+ T cell and Myeloid dendritic cells. These data indicate that TPPP3 is associated with multiple cancers and involves multiple immune-related pathways, and TPPP3 is associated with immune infiltration levels. Besides, the TPPP3 expression may help regulate tumor-associated CD8 + T cells, DC cells in HNSC. We conclude TPPP3 can be considered as a biomarker for predicting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma prognosis and immune infiltration.";"https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3962146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083464/";01/01/2020;Primary Immunodeficiency;0.9127
605;Medical students' perception of the reliability, usefulness and feasibility of unproctored online formative assessment tests.;10.1152/advan.00178.2020;"Medical education has gone online because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Formative assessment is essential to facilitate the learning process in medical education. However, various challenges arise during online assessment, which include reliability, when done without monitoring and practical concerns like Internet connectivity issues. This study was done to assess the medical students' perceptions of the reliability, usefulness, and practical challenges of online tests. One hundred first-year undergraduate medical students taking up online classes and tests in the subject of physiology were enrolled in this study. A questionnaire with items regarding practical challenges, reliability, and usefulness of the online tests, in general, and about different types of online assessment methods, in particular, were sent to the students online. Each item was rated on a five-point Likert scale, and the responses were analyzed anonymously. A large percentage of students used mobile phones (81.4%) to undertake online tests. Although most students (73.2%; P < 0.001) felt that online tests helped them substantially in learning the subject, network connectivity issues were considered to be a matter of serious concern (85.5%, P < 0.001). Among the assessment methods used, viva voce by video conferencing was thought to be most reliable (83%, P < 0.001). Multiple-choice question-based assessment when done online was felt to be more practically feasible with faster feedback than classroom assessment. The results of the study suggest that medical students find online formative assessments helpful for their learning, despite their concerns about reliability and practical challenges.";"https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00178.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529145/";01/03/2021;Formative assessment;0.9488
606;Pharmacists’ Willingness to Provide Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Services and the Needs to Support COVID-19 Testing, Management, and Prevention;10.1007/s10900-020-00946-1;The need for increased testing is pivotal in the response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Recently, through the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, pharmacists were given the ability to order and administer COVID-19 tests, giving them a better opportunity to engage in the pandemic response across the nation as well as in Idaho. This survey sought to determine Idaho pharmacists’ willingness to provide different COVID-19 related services, assess needed resources to provide such services, and identify and prioritize other unmet community needs. We conducted a nine-question, cross-sectional survey distributed to pharmacists with addresses located in Idaho. All questions in the survey were optional and focused on pharmacist’s willingness to provide services, what resources and additional training they would need, difficulty with 90-day prescriptions, and solicited additional feedback using an open-ended question. A total of 229 responses were received, representing all areas of pharmacy practice, with approximately half from community settings. The majority of respondents (70%) were willing to provide COVID-19 testing. Adequate staffing, changes to workflow, and the need for billing and clear reimbursement mechanisms were most frequently cited as barriers to contributing to the COVID-19 response. In summary, we found that pharmacists are very willing to help during this crisis, but their involvement may be better facilitated with the removal of barriers.

607;Metformin Is Associated with Favorable Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus;10.1101/2021.05.20.21257490;Aim: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new pandemic the entire world is facing since December of 2019. In this retrospective study, we aim to address whether metformin use offers a low mortality on patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Materials and Methods: A cohort of 1356 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2DM was analyzed by multivariate regression. Covariates that potentially confound the association were further adjusted using propensity score matching or inverse probability of treatment weighting. A meta-analysis of the present study along with 5 published studies with metformin use prior to admission in patients with COVID-19 and T2DM was carried out. Results: We found that metformin therapy prior to admission in patients with COVID-19 and T2DM was significantly associated with less primary outcome events including in-hospital mortality and hospice care enrollment with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.25 (95% CI, 0.06-0.74) and less in-hospital length of stay, compared to non-metformin group. There were no statistical differences between the metformin group and non-metformin group for all three inflammatory markers (ferritin, CRP, and IL-6) on admission or peak levels during hospitalization. Furthermore, meta-analysis demonstrated that metformin use was significantly correlated with reduced mortality with an OR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.65-0.82) in the fixed effect model and 0.58 (95% CI, 0.42-0.80) for the random effect model.

608;The 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review.;10.1007/978-3-030-59261-5_27;In December 2019, a respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, China, and quickly became a pandemic. In such situations, pregnant women are suspected of being among the vulnerable groups. The aim of this study was to report clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and obstetrical complications, maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women. We searched the Cochrane library, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Web of Sciences from their inception to April 5, 2020. Any study involving pregnant women with COVID-19 which evaluated the effect of the disease on pregnancy outcomes and fetal and neonatal complications was included in the study. The outcomes were the symptoms and laboratory findings, obstetrical complications, mode of delivery, and maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. The search resulted in 69 titles and abstracts, which were narrowed down to 12 studies involving 68 women. The three most common symptoms of patients were fever, cough, and fatigue. The most common laboratory findings were an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphopenia. The most common obstetrical complication was preterm labor (33.3%). No maternal deaths were reported. The Cesarean section rate was 83.3% and the vertical transition rate was 2.23%. The findings showed that the clinical symptoms and laboratory measures of pregnant women affected by COVID-19 did not differ from the general population. In general, the prognosis of mothers who suffered from COVID-19 and their newborns was satisfactory. However, there is a need for further rigorous studies to confirm these findings as the pandemic progresses.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59261-5_27; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656735/";01/01/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.9813
609;COVID-19 during Pregnancy and Postpartum.;10.1080/19390211.2020.1834049;"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Oxidative stress and its related metabolic syndromes are potential risk factors in the susceptibility to, and severity of COVID-19. In concert with the earliest reports of COVID-19, obstetricians started to diagnose and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy (""COVID-19-Pregnancy""). High metabolic demand to sustain normal fetal development increases the burden of oxidative stress in pregnancy. Intracellular redox changes intertwined with acute phase responses at the maternal-fetal interface could amplify during pregnancy. Interestingly, mother-to-fetus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in most of the COVID-19-Pregnancy cases. This relative absence of vertical transmission may be related to the presence of lactoferrin in the placenta, amniotic fluid, and lacteal secretions. However, the cytokine-storm induced during COVID-19-Pregnancy may cause severe inflammatory damage to the fetus, and if uncontrolled, may later result in autism spectrum-like disorders and brain development abnormalities in neonates. Considering this serious health threat to child growth and development, the prevention of COVID-19 during pregnancy should be considered a high priority.

610;Developmental Biology in Chile: historical perspectives and future challenges.;10.1387/ijdb.200181mc;Developmental Biology is a growing discipline in Chile. It started in the 1950s when Luis Izquierdo challenged the traditional descriptive perspective of embryology and comparative anatomy to explore the mechanisms underlying the origin of form. After this initial drive, Claudio Barros beginning in the late 1960s and Juan Fernández in the late 1970s, contributed with unique and complementary facets to the early growth of the discipline. In the 1980s, the community of developmental biologists created its first forms of association together with the reproduction biology community, and in 1993 the first international course of developmental biology was organised. During the 1990s and 2000s, a group of young investigators arrived in Chile after postdocs in Europe and the US to build the first research centres of developmental biology, fostering the discipline to an unprecedented level. In the 2010s, as these centres consolidated, a stream of young developmental biologists established new labs at several institutions, expanding the community size and broadening its scope. The recent organisation of developmental biology meetings fostered the sense of community and nurtured the need of formal organisation, setting the bases for the foundation of the Chilean Society for Developmental Biology in 2019. Today, the community of developmental biologists is a mix of young and experienced investigators working in a variety of geographical locations, institutions, topics and model organisms. These characteristics are a strength of an active community that is pushing the discipline to the next level, aiming to make it a relevant actor in national and international settings.;"https://doi.org/10.1387/ijdb.200181mc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930363/";27/08/2020;Developmental Biology;0.954
611;The effect of large-scale anti-contagion policies on the COVID-19 pandemic.;10.1038/s41586-020-2404-8;Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic1 with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society, but their benefits cannot be directly observed and are currently understood only through process-based simulations2-4. Here, we compile new data on 1,717 local, regional, and national non-pharmaceutical interventions deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth5,6, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 38% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies have significantly and substantially slowed this growth. Some policies have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large, beneficial, and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that across these six countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 62 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting roughly 530 million total infections. These findings may help inform whether or when these policies should be deployed, intensified, or lifted, and they can support decision-making in the other 180+ countries where COVID-19 has been reported7.;"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2404-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32512578/";08/06/2020;coronavirus;0.9559
612;Seroprevalence of Hospital Staff in Province with Zero COVID-19 cases;10.1101/2020.07.13.20151944;"BACKGROUND. COVID-19 seroprevalence data has been scarce, especially in less developed countries with a relatively low infection rate. METHODS. A locally developed rapid IgM/IgG test kit was used for screening hospital staff in Ranong hospital which located in a province with zero COVID-19 prevalence in Thailand from April 17 to May 17, 2020. A total of 844 participants were tested; 82 of which were tested twice with one month apart. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002) RESULTS. Overall, 0.8% of the participants (7 of 844) had positive immunoglobulin M (IgM), none had positive immunoglobulin G (IgG). Female staffs seemed to have higher IgM seropositive than male staffs (1.0% vs. 0.5%). None of the participants with a history of travel to the high-risk area or a history of close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case had developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among 844 staff, 811 had no symptom and six of them developed IgM seropositive (0.7%) while 33 had minor symptoms and only one of them developed IgM seropositive (3.0%). No association between IgM antibody against SARS-CoV-2 status and gender, history of travel to a high-risk area, history of close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case, history of close contact with suspected COVID-19 case, presence of symptoms within 14 days, or previous PCR status was found. None of the hospital staff developed IgG against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION.

613;Walkability and Greenness Do Not Walk Together: Investigating Associations between Greenness and Walkability in a Large Metropolitan City Context;10.3390/ijerph18094429;Background: The existing environment literature separately emphasizes the importance of neighborhood walkability and greenness in enhancing health and wellbeing. Thus, a desirable neighborhood should ideally be green and walkable at the same time. Yet, limited research exists on the prevalence of such “sweet spot” neighborhoods. We sought to investigate this question in the context of a large metropolitan city (i.e., Sydney) in Australia. Methods: Using suburb level normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), percentage urban greenspace, Walk Score(®) (Walk Score, Seattle, WA, USA), and other data, we explored the global and local relationships of neighborhood-level greenness, urban green space (percent park area) with walkability applying both non-spatial and spatial modeling. Results: We found an overall negative relationship between walkability and greenness (measured as NDVI). Most neighborhoods (represented by suburbs) in Sydney are either walkable or green, but not both. Sweet spot neighborhoods that did exist were green but only somewhat walkable. In addition, many neighborhoods were both less green and somewhat walkable. Moreover, we observed a significant positive relationship between percentage park area and walkability. These results indicate walkability and greenness have inverse and, at best, mixed associations in the Sydney metropolitan area. Conclusions: Our analysis indicates an overall negative relationship between greenness and walkability, with significant local variability. With ongoing efforts towards greening Sydney and improving walkability, more neighborhoods may eventually be transformed into becoming greener and more walkable.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8122284/;21/04/2021;suburb level normalized difference vegetative index;0.9001
614;Mathematical Modeling and Covid-19 Forecast in Texas, USA: a prediction model analysis and the probability of disease outbreak.;10.1017/dmp.2021.151;BACKGROUND Response to the unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak needs to be augmented in Texas, USA, where the first 5 cases were reported on March 6, 2020, were rapidly followed by an exponential rise within the next few weeks. This study aimed to determine the ongoing trend and upcoming infection status of COVID-19 in county levels of Texas. METHODS Data were extracted from the following sources: published literature, surveillance, unpublished reports, and websites of Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), Natality report of Texas and WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard. Four-compartment Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removal (SEIR) mathematical model was used to estimate the current trend and future prediction of basic reproduction number and infection case in Texas. Since the basic reproduction number is not sufficient to predict the outbreak, we applied the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model to calculate the probability of the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS The estimated mean basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Texas is predicted 2.65 by January 31, 2021. Our model indicated that the third wave might occur at the beginning of May of 2021, which will peak at the end of June 2021. This prediction may come true if the current spreading situation/level persists, i.e., no clinically effective vaccine is available,or this vaccination program fails for some reason in this area. CONCLUSION Our analysis indicates an alarming ongoing and upcoming infection rate of COVID-19 at county levels of Texas, thereby emphasizing promoting more coordinated and disciplined actions by both policymakers and the population to contain its devastating impact.;"https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006346/";19/05/2021;WHO Coronavirus Disease;0.9555
615;Clinical outcome of standardized oxygen therapy nursing strategy in COVID-19.;10.21037/apm-20-1272;"BACKGROUND Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. However, a technical standard for oxygen therapy nursing, as well as how this would improve clinical outcomes and symptoms, is yet to be explored. METHODS From February 9, 2020, to March 31, 2020, 58 patients of confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the 20th ward of the Eastern Branch, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Fifteen patients who did not receive oxygen therapy and 13 patients who were transferred from other hospitals were excluded. The rest of the 30 patients that received standardized oxygen therapy in our unit were included in the study. Baseline characteristics, symptoms, and finger pulse oxygen saturation were collected during hospitalization. RESULTS Clinical outcomes of the 30 patients were as follows: 27 patients (90.00%) were cured and discharged; 3 patients (10.00%) who continued to stay in hospital were stabilized with symptoms relieved. The fingertip oxygen saturation was 94.80%±3.49% at ICU admission and 97.8%±1.27% when transferred out of ICU after standardized oxygen therapy (P<0.005). The symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and muscle aches of the patients were improved when transferred out of ICU, compared with their condition when admitted to ICU (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The standardized oxygen therapy nursing strategy for patients with COVID-19 emphasizes the nursing measurement, which focuses on the patient's oxygenation. It is led by nurses and starts oxygen therapy at an earlier stage. It not only improves the clinical outcomes of critical patients but also effectively reduces the infection risk of medical staff while emphasizing nursing quality management.";"https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-1272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32692228/";17/07/2020;Novel coronavirus pneumonia;0.9373
616;Preliminary study of Yinhuapinggan granule against H1N1 influenza virus infection in mice through inhibition of apoptosis;10.1080/13880209.2020.1818792;"CONTEXT: Yinhuapinggan granule (YHPG) is frequently used for treating fever, cough, and viral pneumonia in traditional Chinese medicine. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the antiviral effects of YHPG in H1N1 influenza virus (IFV)-infected mice and its possible mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ICR mice were intranasally infected with 10 LD(50) viral dose of IFV and then oral administration of YHPG (6, 12, and 18 g/kg) or oseltamivir (positive control) once a day for 2 or 4 consecutive days, six mice in each group. The lung, spleen and thymus indexes of IFV-infected mice, the expression of viral loads and pathological changes in lung tissues were performed to evaluate the antiviral effects of YHPG. Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot assays were used to determine the expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3. RESULTS: LD(50) in mice was 10(−3.5)/0.02 mL. YHPG (6, 12, and 18 g/kg) dose-dependently decreased the lung index and viral load; the inhibition ratio of lung index was 5.31, 18.22, and 34.06%, respectively. Further detection revealed that YHPG (12 and 18 g/kg) significantly attenuated lung pathological changes, and increased the spleen and thymus indexes. Moreover, YHPG significantly down-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of Bax and caspase-3 in lung tissues of mice infected with IFV, and up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2. CONCLUSIONS: YHPG has significant antiviral effects in IFV-infected mice, partially by inhibiting influenza virus replication and regulating the occurrence of apoptosis induced by influenza virus infection, suggesting that YHPG may be a promising antiviral agent with potential clinical application prospects.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962483/; https://doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.1818792";23/09/2020;Yinhuapinggan granule;0.9484
617;Hashtags in healthcare: understanding Twitter hashtags and online engagement at the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma 2016–2019 meetings;10.1136/tsaco-2020-000496;BACKGROUND: Social media amplifies the accessibility, reach and impact of medical education and conferences alike. The use of hashtags at medical conferences allows material to be discussed and improved on by the experts via online conversation on Twitter. We aim to investigate the utilization of hashtags at the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) meetings from 2016 to 2019 and its potential role in knowledge dissemination and meeting participations. METHODS: Symplur Signals software was used to analyze hashtags for the AAST meetings by year: #AAST2016, #AAST2017, #AAST2018, #AAST2019. RESULTS: Number of tweets decreased significantly from 2016 to 2019 (4500 to 4400 to 3600 to 2600, respectively, p<0.05). Retweets also decreased significantly from 2016 to 2019 (3600 to 3300 to 2600 to 1900, respectively, p<0.05). Users decreased from 2016 to 2019 (1600 to 1400 to 937 to 743, respectively, p<0.05). Despite this decrease, impressions were 5.8 million in 2016, increasing to 8.6 million in 2017, then 9.6 million in 2018 and finally peaking in 2019 where impressions reached 10 million (p<0.05). The top influencer for 2016–2019 was the AAST Twitter account. CONCLUSION: Twitter #AAST 2016–2019 online engagement and interactions have declined during the last 4 years while impressions have grown steadily indicating potential widespread dissemination of trauma-related knowledge and evidence-based practices, and increased online utilization of conference material to trauma surgeons, residents and fellows, trauma scientists, other physicians and the lay public. #AAST online engagement and impressions did not have influence on meeting attendance rates.;"https://doi.org/10.1136/tsaco-2020-000496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923681/";31/08/2020;Social media;0.9763
618;COVID-19 mortality: positive correlation with cloudiness and sunlight but no correlation with latitude in Europe;10.1101/2021.01.27.21250658;"We systematically investigated an ongoing debate about the possible correlation between SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemiological outcomes and solar exposure in European countries, in the period of March - August 2020. For each country, we correlated its mortality data with solar insolation (watt/square metre) and objective sky cloudiness (as cloud fraction) derived from satellite weather data. We found a positive correlation between the monthly mortality rate and the overall cloudiness in that month (Pearson's r(35)=.779, P<.001; linear model fitting the data, adjusted R2 =0.59). In Europe, in colder months, approximately 34% to 58% of the variance in COVID-19 mortality/million appears to be predicted by the cloudiness fraction of the sky, except in August in which only ~15% of the variance was explained. The data show a low, negative correlation between the mortality rate with the overall insolation received by the country area in that entire month (Pearson's r(35)=-0.622, P<.001). Additionally, we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the mortality and the latitude of the countries when the ""latitude of a country"" was precisely defined as the average landmass location (country centroid). The unexpected correlation found between cloudiness and mortality could perhaps be explained by the following: 1) heavy cloudiness is linked with colder outdoor surfaces, which might aid virus survival; 2) reduced evaporation rate; 3) moderate pollution may be linked to both cloudiness and mortality; and 4) large-scale behavioural changes due to cloudiness (which perhaps drives people to spend more time indoors and thus facilitates indoor contamination).";"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250658v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250658";29/01/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.9826
619;Changing from clinician-collected to self-collected throat swabs for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea and chlamydia screening among men who have sex with men.;10.1128/jcm.01215-20;"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led many clinics to move from clinician-collected to self-collected oropharyngeal swabs for the detection of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Before this change, however, self-collection was primarily used for genital and anorectal infections with only limited studies on the performance of self-collected oropharyngeal swabs for oropharyngeal STIs. Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) changed from clinician-collected to self-collected oropharyngeal swabs for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea and chlamydia screening on March 16, 2020 to reduce healthcare worker risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the proportion of valid and positive samples for gonorrhoea and chlamydia among men who have sex with men (MSM) in two time periods; the clinician-collected period between January 20 and March 15, 2020; and the self-collected period between March 16 and May 8, 2020.

The proportion of oropharyngeal swabs with equivocal or invalid results for N. gonorrhoeae was higher in the self-collected period (1.6% [24/1,497]) compared to the clinician-collected period (0.9% [23/2,600]) (p=0.038) but did not differ for the detection of C. trachomatis The positivity of oropharyngeal N. gonorrhoeae (adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) 1.09; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.37; p=0.435) and oropharyngeal C. trachomatis (adjusted PR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.51 to 1.39; p=0.504) did not differ between the two periods. Self-collected oropharyngeal swabs for detection of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis have acceptable performance characteristics and importantly reduce healthcare worker exposure to respiratory infection.";"https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01215-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32611792/";01/07/2020;coronavirus;0.9594
620;Characteristic of Healthcare Workers Infected with COVID-19, a Cross-Sectional Observational Study;10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.009;INTRODUCTION: Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a new emerging infectious disease that was first identified in China, in December 2020 which is caused by SARS-CoV-2. This study describes the characteristics healthcare workers (HCWs) who tested positive for COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital in Oman. METHOD: a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of COVID-19 infected HCWs. RESULTS: During the study period, 204 HCWs were tested positive for COVID-19 by rRT-PCR test with a test positivity rate of 21.2% and the percentage of infected hospital staff was 4.3%. The mean age was 36 years, 2.2% of the male staff were infected while 9.3% of the female staff got infected. Among the clinicians, 4.7% were infected and among the nurses, 4.1% were infected. 61.3% (125) of infection were community acquired followed by hospital acquisition 25.5% (52) and no source was identified in 13.2% (27). There was a significant difference between hospital acquired and community acquired COVID-19 infection between different HCWs categories (p < 0.001), gender (p = 0.041) and being at risk of COVID 19 exposure in the hospital (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in relation to nationality (p = 0498), age (p = 0.119) or presence of co-morbidities (p = 0.326). 78% (n = 160) had no chronic diseases, presented with ARI and fever 44% (n = 90) and all had uneventful full recovery. The peak of infection acquisition was after Eid AL Fiter Festival. CONCLUSION: HCWs are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection at the workplace. Strengthening the infection control measures to prevent exposures from infected patients or colleagues and reduce the spread of COVID- 19 is a necessity.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220322128?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220322128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33039607/";08/10/2020;Corona Virus Disease 19;0.9319
621;Numerical study of COVID-19 spatial–temporal spreading in London;10.1063/5.0048472;"A recent study reported that an aerosolized virus (COVID-19) can survive in the air for a few hours. It is highly possible that people get infected with the disease by breathing and contact with items contaminated by the aerosolized virus. However, the aerosolized virus transmission and trajectories in various meteorological environments remain unclear. This paper has investigated the movement of aerosolized viruses from a high concentration source across a dense urban area. The case study looks at the highly air polluted areas of London: University College Hospital (UCH) and King's Cross and St Pancras International Station (KCSPI). We explored the spread and decay of COVID-19 released from the hospital and railway stations with the prescribed meteorological conditions. The study has three key findings: the primary result is that the concentration of viruses decreases rapidly by a factor of 2–3 near the sources although the virus may travel from meters up to hundreds of meters from the source location for certain meteorological conditions. The secondary finding shows viruses released into the atmosphere from entry and exit points at KCSPI remain trapped within a small radial distance of < 50 m. This strengthens the case for the use of face coverings to reduce the infection rate. The final finding shows that there are different levels of risk at various door locations for UCH; depending on which door is used there can be a higher concentration of COVID-19. Although our results are based on London, since the fundamental knowledge processes are the same, our study can be further extended to other locations (especially the highly air polluted areas) in the world.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953530/; https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0048472; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09902v2.pdf";20/04/2021;aerosolized virus;0.9454
622;An assessment of the use of patient reported outcome measurements (PROMs) in cancers of the pelvic abdominal cavity: identifying oncologic benefit and an evidence-practice gap in routine clinical practice;10.1186/s12955-020-01648-x;BACKGROUND: Patient reported outcome measurements (PROMs) are emerging as an important component of patient management in the cancer setting, providing broad perspectives on patients’ quality of life and experience. The use of PROMs is, however, generally limited to the context of randomised control trials, as healthcare services are challenged to sustain high quality of care whilst facing increasing demand and financial shortfalls. We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify any oncological benefit of using PROMs and investigate the wider impact on patient experience, in cancers of the pelvic abdominal cavity specifically. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using MEDLINE (Pubmed) and Ovid Gateway (Embase and Ovid) until April 2020. Studies investigating the oncological outcomes of PROMs were deemed suitable for inclusion. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies were included from 2167 screened articles. Various domains of quality of life (QoL) were identified as potential prognosticators for oncologic outcomes in cancers of the pelvic abdominal cavity, independent of other clinicopathological features of disease: 3 studies identified global QoL as a prognostic factor, 6 studies identified physical and role functioning, and 2 studies highlighted fatigue. In addition to improved outcomes, a number of included studies also reported that the use of PROMs enhanced both patient-clinician communication and patient satisfaction with care in the clinical setting. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the necessity of routine collection of PROMs within the pelvic abdominal cancer setting to improve patient quality of life and outcomes.;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-020-01648-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33451330/";15/01/2021;Patient reported outcome measurements;0.9301
623;Application of records theory on the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon: prediction and prevention;10.1017/s0950268820001909;Given the fast spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) worldwide and its classification by the World Health Organization (WHO) as being one of the worst pandemics in history, several scientific studies are carried out using various statistical and mathematical models to predict and study the likely evolution of this pandemic in the world. In the present research paper, we present a brief study aiming to predict the probability of reaching a new record number of COVID-19 cases in Lebanon, based on the record theory, giving more insights about the rate of its quick spread in Lebanon. The main advantage of the records theory resides in avoiding several statistical constraints concerning the choice of the underlying distribution and the quality of the residuals. In addition, this theory could be used, in cases where the number of available observations is somehow small. Moreover, this theory offers an alternative solution in case where machine learning techniques and long-term memory models are inapplicable because they need a considerable amount of data to be performant. The originality of this paper lies in presenting a new statistical approach allowing the early detection of unexpected phenomena such as the new pandemic COVID-19. For this purpose, we used epidemiological data from Johns Hopkins University to predict the trend of COVID-2019 in Lebanon. Our method is useful in calculating the probability of reaching a new record as well as studying the propagation of the disease. It also computes the probabilities of the waiting time to observe the future COVID-19 record. Our results obviously confirm the quick spread of the disease in Lebanon over a short time.;"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268820001909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32843111/";26/08/2020;coronavirus;0.9643
624;Aortic Angiosarcoma in Association with Endovascular Aneurysm Repair: Case Report and Review of the Literature.;10.12659/ajcr.931740;BACKGROUND Primary aortic sarcoma often poses diagnostic challenges for pathologists and clinicians because of a very low incidence and controversy over nomenclature and definition. We report a case of aortic angiosarcoma in association with a graft. We also conducted a clinicopathological review of cases of primary aortic sarcomas associated with implanted grafts. CASE REPORT The patient was an 82-year-old woman. She underwent thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) at age 78 because of an aneurysm in the descending aorta. Approximately 4 years after the TEVAR, computed tomography revealed a type II endoleak and expansion of the aneurysm. Her c-reactive protein level rose to 34 mg/dL, and Ga scintigraphy showed 67Ga accumulation at the aneurysm. She had fever up to 39°C, and a stent graft infection was suspected. Despite administration of antibiotics, her condition deteriorated, and she died. Postmortem examination identified epithelioid aortic angiosarcoma at the aorta with aneurysm repair and the graft, and the aortic angiosarcoma invaded the left lower lobe of the lung. CONCLUSIONS Our clinicopathological review revealed that the proper clinical diagnosis was very difficult owing to confusion of aortic sarcoma after the implantation with the infected graft, atypical endoleak, or pseudoaneurysm. The histological diagnosis was ambiguous because immunohistochemical and genetic studies were not adequately conducted. Overall prognosis of aortic sarcoma is poor as most patients die within a year, with no effective treatments. It is hoped that recent projects for genomic medicine will provide useful insights about the diagnosis and treatment of these cancers.;"https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.931740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118148/";12/06/2021;Primary aortic sarcoma;0.9547
625;Evaluation of two commercial and two non-commercial immunoassays for the detection of prior infection to SARS-CoV-2;10.1101/2020.06.24.20139006;BACKGROUND: Seroepidemiology is an important tool to characterize the epidemiology and immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2 but many immunoassays have not been externally validated raising questions about reliability of study findings. To ensure meaningful data, particularly in a low seroprevalence population, assays need to be rigorously characterized with high specificity. METHODS: We evaluated two commercial (Roche Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics IgM/IgG) and two non-commercial (Simoa and Ragon/MGH IgG) immunoassays against 68 confirmed positive and 232 pre-pandemic negative controls. Sensitivity was stratified by time from symptom onset. The Simoa multiplex assay applied three pre-defined algorithm models to determine sample result. RESULTS: The Roche and Ragon/MGH IgG assays each registered 1/232 false positive, the primary Simoa model registered 2/232 false positives, and the Epitope registered 2/230 and 3/230 false positives for the IgG and IgM assays respectively. Sensitivity >21 days post symptom-onset was 100% for all assays except Epitope IgM, but lower and/or with greater variability between assays for samples collected 9–14 days (67–100%) and 15–21 days (69–100%) post-symptom onset. The Simoa and Epitope IgG assays demonstrated excellent sensitivity earlier in the disease course. The Roche and Ragon/MGH assays were less sensitive during early disease, particularly among immunosuppressed individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The Epitope IgG demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity. The Roche and Ragon/MGH IgG assays registered rare false positives with lower early sensitivity. The Simoa assay primary model had excellent sensitivity and few false positives.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32607518/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.24.20139006v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.20139006";26/06/2020;Seroepidemiology;0.9718
626;Comparison of aerosol box intubation with C-MAC video laryngoscope and direct laryngoscopy—A randomised controlled trial;10.4103/ija.ija_1218_20;BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious disease and healthcare workers are at constant risk for contracting it. Nowadays, aerosol box is used in conjunction with WHO-recommended safety kits, to avoid health workers from getting SARS-CoV-2 infection during aerosol-generating procedures. In our study, we compared the ease of oral intubation with C-MAC video laryngoscope and direct laryngoscopy, when the aerosol box was used. The secondary objectives were to compare the incidence of airway loss, haemodynamic changes, number of attempts, and time required for intubation between these two techniques. METHODS: This prospective randomised controlled study was conducted on 60 non-coronavirus disease (COVID) patients presenting for elective surgery under general anaesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups:C and D using a computer-generated random sequence of numbers by closed envelope technique. In group D, laryngoscopy was performed with Macintosh blade and in group C, with Storz® C-MAC video laryngoscope. RESULTS: The ease of intubation was better (grade 1) in group C than D (68.6% vs. 31.4% respectively) with a P value of < 0.001. 10% of patients required more than one intubation attempt in group D compared to none in group C, but this difference was not statistically significant. The intubation time was comparable between the two groups. There were no incidences of loss of airway or failure to intubate in both groups. CONCLUSION: The use of C-MAC video-laryngoscopy resulted in easier orotracheal intubation as compared to intubation with direct laryngoscopy when the aerosol box was used.;"https://doi.org/10.4103/ija.ija_1218_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776088/";10/02/2021;non-coronavirus disease;0.9769
627;Development, evaluation, and validation of machine learning models for COVID-19 detection based on routine blood tests.;10.1515/cclm-2020-1294;"Objectives The rRT-PCR test, the current gold standard for the detection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), presents with known shortcomings, such as long turnaround time, potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates around 15-20%, and expensive equipment. The hematochemical values of routine blood exams could represent a faster and less expensive alternative. Methods Three different training data set of hematochemical values from 1,624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive), admitted at San Raphael Hospital (OSR) from February to May 2020, were used for developing machine learning (ML) models: the complete OSR dataset (72 features: complete blood count (CBC), biochemical, coagulation, hemogasanalysis and CO-Oxymetry values, age, sex and specific symptoms at triage) and two sub-datasets (COVID-specific and CBC dataset, 32 and 21 features respectively). 58 cases (50% COVID-19 positive) from another hospital, and 54 negative patients collected in 2018 at OSR, were used for internal-external and external validation. Results We developed five ML models: for the complete OSR dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.83 to 0.90; for the COVID-specific dataset from 0.83 to 0.87; and for the CBC dataset from 0.74 to 0.86. The validations also achieved good results: respectively, AUC from 0.75 to 0.78; and specificity from 0.92 to 0.96. Conclusions ML can be applied to blood tests as both an adjunct and alternative method to rRT-PCR for the fast and cost-effective identification of COVID-19-positive patients. This is especially useful in developing countries, or in countries facing an increase in contagions.";"https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-1294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079698/";21/10/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9568
628;Diarrhoea in adults with coronavirus disease-beyond incidence and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis.;10.1080/23744235.2021.1885733;AIM Diarrhoea is a relatively common manifestation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but there is no systematic review which comprehensively describes it beyond its incidence and impact on prognosis. This study aims to provide a detailed systematic review of diarrhoea in adults with COVID-19. METHODS A PUBMED and Scopus search (until 7 September 2020) was performed. Studies that were limited to describing incidence of diarrhoea and its effect on prognosis were excluded. RESULTS Twenty-six papers including 7860 patients with COVID-19 were subjected to synthesis. Mean duration of diarrhoea was 4.2 (3.6-4.9) days (range 1-16 days), whereas mean bowel movement count was 4.6 (3.8-5.3) and maximum was 20 per day. Diarrhoea started on an average 5.1 (3.8-6.5) days after disease onset but was the first manifestation in 4.3% patients. Stool occult blood was detected in 6.8% of patients with diarrhoea, while 53.3% cases had watery diarrhoea. Patients with diarrhoea also had elevated faecal calprotectin. Viral genome in faeces was detected more often in patients with diarrhoea and most often in patients without respiratory symptoms. Fever, myalgia and respiratory symptoms were observed with the same incidence in patients with and without diarrhoea. Similarly, there were no differences noted in complete blood count and most inflammation biomarkers between patients with and without diarrhoea. However, nausea, vomiting abdominal pain, sneezing and headache were more common in patients with diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was the main manifestation of COVID-19 in 6.1% of cases and this form of the disease had specific features.

629;Keeping Patients at Risk for Self-Harm Safe in the Emergency Department: A Protocolized Approach.;10.1016/j.jcjq.2020.08.013;BACKGROUND Increasing numbers of patients with psychiatric illness are boarding in emergency departments (EDs) for longer periods. Many patients are at high risk of harm to self, and maintaining their safety is critical. The objectives of this study are to describe the development and implementation of a comprehensive safety precautions protocol for ED patients at risk for self-harm and to report the observed changes in rates of self-harm. METHODS A multidisciplinary team developed comprehensive safety precautions, including the creation of safe bathrooms, increasing the number and training of observers, protocols to manage access to belongings and for clothing search or removal, and additional interventions for exceptionally high-risk patients. Events of attempted self-harm were measured for 12 months before and after new safety precautions were enacted. RESULTS In the 12 months prior to the protocol initiation, among 4,408 at-risk patients, there were 13 episodes of attempted self-harm (2.95 per 1,000 at-risk patients), and 6 that resulted in actual self-harm (1.36 per 1,000 at-risk patients). In the 12 months after the protocol was introduced, among the 4,523 at-risk patients, there were 6 episodes of attempted self-harm (1.33 per 1,000 at-risk patients, p = 0.11) and only 1 that resulted in actual self-harm (0.22 per 1,000 at-risk patients, p = 0.07). There were no deaths. CONCLUSION Comprehensive safety precautions can be successfully developed and implemented in the ED. These precautions correlated with lower, although not statistically significant, rates of self-harm. Further study of similar interventions with adequately powered samples could be beneficial.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjq.2020.08.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962905/";28/08/2020;emergency departments;0.9013
630;Development and Application of Oblique Lumbar Interbody Fusion;10.1111/os.12625;The present study reviewed the relevant recent literature regarding the development and application of oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF), with a particular focus on its application and associated complications. The study evaluated the rationality of this technique and demonstrated the direction of future research by collecting data on previous operative outcomes and complications. A literature search was performed in Pubmed and Web of Science, including the following keywords and abbreviations: anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF), direct lateral interbody fusion (DLIF), extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF), oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF), adjacent segment disease (ASD), and adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS). A search of literature published from January 2005 to January 2019 was conducted and all studies evaluating development and application of OLIF were included in the review. According to the literature, the indications for OLIF are various. OLIF has excellent orthopaedic effects in degenerative scoliosis patients and the incidence of bony fusion is higher than for other approaches. It also provides a better choice for revision surgery. It has various advantages in many aspects, but the complications cannot be ignored. As a new minimally invasive technique, the advantages of OLIF are obvious, but further evaluation is needed to compare its operation‐related data with that of traditional open surgery. In addition, more prospective studies are required to compare minimally invasive and open spinal surgery to confirm its specific efficacy, risk, advantages, learning curve, and ultimate clinical efficacy.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967883/;15/03/2020;adjacent segment disease;0.9375
631;Public Compliance With Social Distancing Measures and SARS-CoV-2 Spread : A Quantitative Analysis of 5 States.;10.1177/00333549211011254;OBJECTIVE We quantified the association between public compliance with social distancing measures and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the epidemic (March-May 2020) in 5 states that accounted for half of the total number of COVID-19 cases in the United States. METHODS We used data on mobility and number of COVID-19 cases to longitudinally estimate associations between public compliance, as measured by human mobility, and the daily reproduction number and daily growth rate during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. RESULTS The 5 states mandated social distancing directives during March 19-24, 2020, and public compliance with mandates started to decrease in mid-April 2020. As of May 31, 2020, the daily reproduction number decreased from 2.41-5.21 to 0.72-1.19, and the daily growth rate decreased from 0.22-0.77 to -0.04 to 0.05 in the 5 states. The level of public compliance, as measured by the social distancing index (SDI) and daily encounter-density change, was high at the early stage of implementation but decreased in the 5 states. The SDI was negatively associated with the daily reproduction number (regression coefficients range, -0.04 to -0.01) and the daily growth rate (from -0.009 to -0.01). The daily encounter-density change was positively associated with the daily reproduction number (regression coefficients range, 0.24 to 1.02) and the daily growth rate (from 0.05 to 0.26). CONCLUSIONS Social distancing is an effective strategy to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 and illustrates the role of public compliance with social distancing measures to achieve public health benefits.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549211011254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33909541/";28/04/2021;CONCLUSIONS Social distancing;0.9356

Methods: An online survey of psychological and sleep by using Questionnaire Star program from 5th to 19th February 2020 was conducted. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised was used to assess COVID-19 outbreak-related stress symptoms. Meanwhile, Questionnaires of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Insomnia Severity Index were respectively used to assess the severity of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 3 134 subjects were included. Among the included subjects, 15.5% (487), 24.9% (779), 28.7% (899) and 30.9% (968) of the subjects had COVID-19-related stress symptoms, anxiety, depression and insomnia after the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. The severity levels of anxiety, depression and insomnia were significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to prior to the outbreak (all P<0.01). Furthermore, the subjects' stress response to the COVID-19 outbreak was an independent risk factor for increased anxiety, depression and insomnia after the outbreak. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in related stress response and widespread increase in anxiety, depression, and insomnia outside Hubei Province, China in the general population. The aggravation of anxiety, depression and insomnia is associated with stress levels. Our data demonstrate that the widespread psychological and insomnia problems in the general population need to be addressed at the early phase of the pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200302-00557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33238672/";24/11/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9851

High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is often used for neonates with refractory respiratory failure related to RDS. Volume guarantee (VG) mode has been added to some HFOV ventilators for providing consistent tidal volume. We sought to examine the impact of adding the VG mode during HFOV on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics, which has not been studied to date. A neonatal piglet model of moderate to severe RDS was induced by saline lavage. Piglets (full term, age 1-3 days, weight 1.5-2.4 kg) were randomized to have RDS induced and receive either HFOV or HFOV+VG (n = 8/group) or sham-operation (n = 6) without RDS. Cardiac function measured by a Millar® catheter placed in the left ventricle as well as systemic and carotid hemodynamic and oxygen tissue saturation parameters were collected over 240 min of ventilation. Mean airway pressure, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference and left ventricular cardiac index of piglets on HFOV vs. HFOV+VG were not significantly different during the experimental period. Right common carotid artery flow index by in-situ ultrasonic flow measurement and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (near-infrared spectroscopy) significantly decreased in HFOV+VG at 240 min compared to HFOV (14 vs. 31 ml/kg/min, and 30% vs. 43%, respectively; p<0.05). There were no significant differences in lung, brain and heart tissue markers of oxidative stress, ischemia and inflammation.

634;Modeling the dynamics of COVID19 spread during and after social distancing;10.1101/2020.06.13.20130625;"Non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, have so far been the only means to slow the spread of COVID19. In the United States, strict social distancing has resulted in different types infection dynamics. In some states, such as New York, extensive infection spread was followed by a pronounced decline of infection levels. In other states, such as California, less infection spread occurred before strict social distancing, and a different pattern was observed. Instead of a pronounced infection decline, a long-lasting plateau is evident, characterized by similar daily new infection levels. While these plateau dynamics cannot be readily reproduced with standard SIR infection models, we show that network models, in which individuals and their social contacts are explicitly tracked, can reproduce the plateau if network connections are cut due to social distancing measures. The reason is that in networks characterized by a degree of 2D spatial structure, infection tends to spread quadratically with time, but as edges are randomly removed, the infection spreads along nearly one-dimensional infection ""corridors"", resulting in plateau dynamics. Interestingly, the plateau dynamics are predicted to eventually transition into an infection decline phase without any further increase in social distancing measures. Additionally, the models suggest that a potential second wave becomes significantly less pronounced if social distancing is only relaxed once the dynamics have transitioned to the decline phase.

METHODS: The COVID‐19 Emergency Department (COVED) Project is an ongoing prospective cohort study that includes all adult patients presenting to The Alfred Hospital ED who undergo testing for SARS‐CoV‐2. Current guidelines recommend testing for patients with fevers or chills, acute respiratory symptoms or a high‐risk exposure history, as well as implementation of infection control and prevention (IPC) precautions for all suspected and confirmed cases. Study outcomes include a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test result and intensive respiratory support. RESULTS: In the period 1‐30 April 2020, 702 of 3453 ED patients (20%; 95%CI: 19‐22) were tested, with a significant increase during the study period (IRR 1.019; 95%CI: 1.017‐1.021, p<0.001). The primary outcome of a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test was recorded in 14 patients (2%; 95%CI: 1‐3). Shortness of breath (77%), fatigue (100%), myalgia (67%) and diarrhoea (67%) were common among positive cases, while close contact (9%), fever (0%) and healthcare occupation (0%) were not. No positive cases required intensive respiratory support in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of ED patients with suspected COVID‐19 is increasing. Low numbers of positive cases precluded development of accurate predictive tools, but the COVED Project is fulfilling an important role in monitoring the burden of IPC requirements on the ED. The increasing number of patients meeting isolation criteria has the potential to impact on patient flow and may lead to ED overcrowding.";"https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533613/";13/06/2020;Emergency Department;0.9203

Methods: We analyzed questionnaire data from the end of May 2020 from 180 hospitals (total of 102,578 beds) with acute medical centers. Results: A total of 4,938 hospitalized patients with COVID–19 were confirmed. Of 1,100 severe COVID–19 inpatients, 112 remained hospitalized and 138 died. There were 4,852 patients presumed to be severe COVID–19 patients who were confirmed later to be not infected. Twenty–seven hospitals (15% of 180 hospitals) converted their intensive care unit (ICU) to a unit for COVID–19 patients only, and 107 (59%) had to manage both severe COVID–19 patients and others in the same ICU. Restriction of ICU admission occurred in one of the former 27 hospitals and 21 of the latter 107 hospitals. Shortage of N95 masks was the most serious concern regarding personal protective equipment. As for issues that raised ICU bed occupancy, difficulty undertaking or progressing rehabilitation for severe patients (42%), and the improved patients (28%), long–lasting severely ill patients (36%), and unclear isolation criteria (34%) were mentioned. Many acute medicine physicians assisted regional governmental agencies, functioning as advisors and volunteer coordinators. Conclusion: The mortality rate of COVID–19 in this study was 4.1% of all hospitalized patients and 12.5% (one in eight) severe patients. The hospitals with dedicated COVID–19 ICUs accepted more patients with severe COVID–19 and had lower ICU admission restrictions, which could be helpful as a strategy in the next pandemic.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8207129/;13/05/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9026
637;An 8-year retrospective survey of assessment in postgraduate dental training in complicated tooth extraction competency;10.1016/j.jds.2020.11.006;BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) has been increasingly used in health education in recent years. This study evaluated the effect of education and trainees’ perception of assessment on the clinical skills of postgraduate dental trainees in complicated tooth extraction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted as a retrospective survey among postgraduate dental trainees learning complicated tooth extraction in Taipei and Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 2012 to 2019. Practical skills were assessed using DOPS by trainees and faculty members. Each clinical case included a complicated extraction of a permanent tooth. RESULTS: A total of 69 participants (26 men and 43 women, average age = 26.49 years, range = 24–34 years) were included in this study. Within the survey cohort, faculty assessments scored significantly higher than did trainees’ self-assessments in each complicated tooth extraction procedure, with no difference between both sexes. The higher-performing trainees tended to underrate their performance much more than did the lower-performing trainees. More than 40% of the trainees evaluated themselves as having “poor capability” in some invasive surgical procedures, even though their actual performance was not lower than that of those who evaluated themselves as having adequate or good capability. CONCLUSION: Self-assessment skills should be developed with more practice and experience. We hope that these findings can guide the planning of faculty development programs for clinical instructors, particularly the new cohort of faculty who will succeed the rapidly retiring boomer generation in the next 10 years.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520117/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1991790220302439; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jds.2020.11.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1991790220302439";24/12/2020;Direct observation of procedural skills;0.9776
638;Application of antigenic biomarkers for Mycobacterium tuberculosis;10.1631/jzus.b2000325;The study and characterization of biomolecules involved in the interaction between mycobacteria and their hosts are crucial to determine their roles in the invasion process and provide basic knowledge about the biology and pathogenesis of disease. Promising new biomarkers for diagnosis and immunotherapy have emerged recently. My-cobacterium is an ancient pathogen that has developed complex strategies for its persistence in the host and environment, likely based on the complexity of the network of interactions between the molecules involved in infection. Several biomarkers have received recent attention in the process of developing rapid and reliable detection techniques for tuberculosis. Among the most widely investigated antigens are CFP-10 (10-kDa culture filtrate protein), ESAT-6 (6-kDa early secretory antigenic target), Ag85A, Ag85B, CFP-7, and PPE18. Some of these antigens have been proposed as biomarkers to assess the key elements of the response to infection of both the pathogen and host. The design of novel and accurate diagnostic methods is essential for the control of tuberculosis worldwide. Presently, the diagnostic methods are based on the identification of molecules in the humoral response in infected individuals. Therefore, these tests depend on the capacity of the host to develop an immune response, which usually is heterogeneous. In the last 20 years, special attention has been given to the design of multiantigenic diagnostic methods to improve the levels of sensitivity and specificity. In this review, we summarize the state of the art in the study and use of mycobacterium biomolecules with the potential to support novel tuberculosis control strategies.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7670104/;17/11/2020;10-kDa culture filtrate protein;0.9378
639;Covid-19: A systemic disease treated with a wide-ranging approach: A case report.;10.15586/jptcp.v27isp1.691;"At the end of December 2019, the Health Commission of the city of Wuhan, China, alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) to a pneumonia cluster in the city. The cause was identified as being a new virus, later named SARS-CoV-2. We can distinguish three clinical phases of the disease with a distinct pathogenesis, manifestations and prognosis. Here, we describe the case of a 45-year-old male, successfully treated for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The patient was feeling sick in early April 2020; he had a fever and pharyngodynia. When he came to our COVID hospital, his breathing was normal. The nasopharyngeal swab specimen turned out positive. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed mild interstitial pneumonia. The patient was admitted to our department and treated with hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, darunavir, azithromycin and enoxaparin. On day seven of the disease, the patient's respiratory condition got worse as he was developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was given tocilizumab and corticosteroids and was immediately treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). His condition improved, and in the ensuing days, the treatment gradually switched to a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC); after 18 days, the patient's clinical condition was good.The successful results we have been able to obtain are closely associated with avoidance of invasive ventilation that may lead to intensive care unit (ICU)-related superinfections. In our opinion, it is fundamental to understand that COVID-19 is a systemic disease that is a consequence of an overwhelming inflammatory response, which can cause severe medical conditions, even in young patients.";"https://doi.org/10.15586/jptcp.v27isp1.691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32650356/";03/07/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9621
640;Addictive behaviors and craving during the COVID-19 pandemic of people who have recovered from substance use disorder.;10.1080/10550887.2020.1856298;Stressors caused by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) contribute to increased addictive behaviors in the general population worldwide. Little is known, however, about addictive behaviors of people who have recovered a long time ago, even years, from substance use disorder (SUD). The goal of the present research was to examine the craving for drug use and addictive behaviors (tobacco and alcohol consumption, viewing of pornography, gambling, and shopping online) of people who recovered from SUD, before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: During one week of isolation imposed in Israel following the outbreak of COVID-19 in April, 2020, a self-report questionnaire was distributed to a convenience sample of 113 people who had recovered from SUD, aged 22-69, 78% men. Results Fifty-one percent of participants reported craving drugs during the isolation period and engaging in addictive behaviors. Significant differences were found in tobacco and alcohol consumption, gambling, and viewing of pornography online, before and after the outbreak of the pandemic, especially in participants who reported having engaged in these addictive behaviors to some extent before the outbreak. A hierarchical linear regression showed a significant explained variance (R 2=44%, p<.001), with stronger feelings of loneliness and shorter length of time free from drug use being associated with stronger craving for drugs. Conclusions: The drug addiction treatment establishment should pay close attention and strengthen communication with people who recovered from SUD. It is necessary to develop real-time anti-craving and anti-replacement addiction interventions to prevent relapses.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2020.1856298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305702/";11/12/2020;coronavirus pandemic;0.9119
641;Tröpfchenexposition bei Tracheotomie: Fallanalyse und Konsequenzen in Bezug auf COVID-19-Patienten;10.1007/s00106-021-01050-z;BACKGROUND: The COVID(coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic is characterized by high infectivity, droplet transmission, and high viral load in the upper respiratory tract. Severe disease courses are associated with interstitial pneumonia and ventilated patients, in whom tracheotomy (TT)—a droplet- and aerosol-producing medical intervention—is regularly necessary. TT as a potential infection risk for medical staff is scarcely found in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify droplet exposure of the surgical team during TT, to better define the requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical TT was performed in four non-infectious patients, during which the surgeon and his assistant both wore a surgical nasal mask with a transparent visor. After the procedure, the type, distribution, and number of droplets on the visor were determined macroscopically and microscopically. RESULTS: An average of 29 droplets were found on the middle third of the visor, 4 on the right third, and 13 on the left third, with an average droplet size of 571 µm (± 381 µm). The smallest droplets were 55 µm, the largest 1431 µm. An increase in the number of droplets was found with increased ventilation during the procedure. Blood droplets were more common than secretion droplets. CONCLUSION: Contamination of the visor with droplets was demonstrated. Especially in the case of TT in highly infectious patients, e.g., COVID-19 patients, the use of hooded headgear in combination with breathing apparatus with air purification and power supply is recommended to ensure best protection from infection for the surgeon and the surgical assistant.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00106-021-01050-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852060/";14/04/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9725
642;A vaccine built from potential immunogenic pieces derived from the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein;10.1101/2020.09.24.312355;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a new global threat demanding a multidisciplinary effort to fight its etiological agent—severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this regard, immunoinformatics may aid to predict prominent immunogenic regions from critical SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, such as the spike (S) glycoprotein, for their use in prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against this rapidly emerging coronavirus. Accordingly, in this study, an integrated immunoinformatics approach was applied to identify cytotoxic T cell (CTC), T helper cell (THC), and Linear B cell (BC) epitopes from the S glycoprotein in an attempt to design a high-quality multi-epitope vaccine. The best CTC, THC, and BC epitopes showed high viral antigenicity, lack of allergenic or toxic residues, and suitable HLA-viral peptide interactions. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its receptor-binding motif (RBM) harbour several potential epitopes. The structure prediction, refinement, and validation data indicate that the multi-epitope vaccine has an appropriate conformation and stability. Three conformational epitopes and an efficient binding between Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the vaccine model were observed. Importantly, the population coverage analysis showed that the multi-epitope vaccine could be used globally. Notably, computer-based simulations suggest that the vaccine model has a robust potential to evoke and maximize both immune effector responses and immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. Further research is needed to accomplish with the mandatory international guidelines for human vaccine formulations.

643;Cesarean section prevalence at a baby-friendly hospital in southern Brazil: current context in the face of COVID-19;10.1101/2021.05.03.21256516;Objective: To analyze cesarean prevalence at a baby-friendly hospital in Southern Brazil between 2017 and 2020 and possible annual and monthly changes due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study using secondary data retrieved from the electronic information system of a Baby-Friendly Hospital in the municipality of Rio Grande, RS, Brazil. Data was retrieved for all hospitalizations at the obstetric center between January 1st 2017 and December 31st 2020. Data on COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the municipal government website. Annual and monthly cesarean prevalence rates were calculated in comparison to the same periods in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Differences in prevalence rates were tested using a chi-square test, taking a significance level of less than 5%. Prevalence ratios were estimated for 2018/2017, 2019/2018, and 2020/2019. Results: 7,294 childbirths were included. Cesarean prevalence was 42.6% in 2017, 44.3% in 2018, 40.2% in 2019, and 51.0% in 2020. In 2018/2017, there was no statistically significant difference in cesarean prevalence (95%CI: 0.90-1.20). Between 2019/2018, there was a reduction of approximately 20% in prevalence (95%CI: 0.69-0.93). The scenario changes between 2020/2019 with a 40% increase in cesareans (95%CI: 1.20-1.62). The period comprising July to December 2020 was the only period in which over half the deliveries were done by cesarean section, exceeding 60% in July. Conclusion: Cesarean prevalence rates increased in 2020 in relation to the three preceding years. The data highlight the need to reinforce compliance with childbirth protocols to reduce cesarean sections in baby-friendly hospitals.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.03.21256516; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.03.21256516v1?rss=1";05/05/2021;coronavirus;0.9422
644;Turkish Thoracic Society Experts Consensus Report: Recommendations for Pulmonary Function Tests During and After COVID 19 Pandemic.;10.5152/turkthoracj.2020.20107;The recommendation of conducting pulmonary function tests (PFTs) from different societies during and after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was rated by the experts of the Turkish Thoracic Society (TTS) and presented as the TTS experts consensus report. Information about the topic has been provided.Globally, as of mid-May 2020, there have been over 4.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19. There are two main routes of transmission of COVID-19: respiratory droplets and contact transmission. PFTs are non-invasive tests that are commonly performed in routine assessment and follow-up of patients in the pulmonology units. However, PFTs may generate aerosols and require sharing common surfaces. With regard to the high prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the community, PFTs should not be performed routinely in confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic. Because of the risk of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, PFTs should be restricted to a small patient population with selected indications. Triage for COVID-19 should be performed prior to testing. Only essential PFTs such as spirometry, diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), arterial blood gas analysis, or pulse oximetry should be performed in the selected cases. Tests should be scheduled to allow sufficient time for donning and doffing of the technical personnel with the full personal protective equipment (PPE) (gown, a filtering respirator mask, goggles or full-face shield, and disposable gloves), ventilation of the room, and application of post-test cleaning and disinfection procedures of the equipment and the testing room.;"https://doi.org/10.5152/turkthoracj.2020.20107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32584237/";01/05/2020;pulmonary function tests;0.9604

The COVID-19 vaccine has been presented as the perfect solution for solving the current pandemic. Understanding the willingness of the community to receive the COVID-19 vaccine will help in the development and implementation of effective COVID-19 vaccination promotion programs. The aim of this study was to assess the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and its associated factors in Sodo town, Wolaita zone, Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 415 participants in Wolaita Sodo, from April 1 to 30, 2021. To collect data, structured interviewer administered questionnaire was used. A p-value ≤0.05 in a multivariable logistic regression model was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 415 participants, 189 (45.5%) of them accepted of COVID-19 vaccines if available. Sex (AOR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.56), educational status (AOR=3.09, 95% CI: 1.50, 6.37), mass media (AOR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.63), received any vaccination during childhood (AOR=5.16, 95% CI: 2.44, 10.92), family members have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (AOR=4.40, 95% CI: 2.1, 9.25), friends have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (AOR=3.91, 95% CI: 1.52, 10.04), and respondents have tested for COVID-19 (AOR=4.40, 95% CI: 1.70, 11.36) were significantly associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine.

646;Peculiar clinical presentation of COVID- 19 and predictors of mortality in the elderly: a Multicentre Retrospective Cohort Study;10.1016/j.ijid.2021.03.021;Background The spectrum of clinical manifestations of CoronaVirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is not yet completely known. In elderly, mortality and extra-pulmonary involvement appear to be more frequent than expected. Methods A multicentric-retrospective-case-series of patients hospitalized between March 1st and June 15th, 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR testing on throat/nasopharyngeal swabs and age ≥65 years was analysed. Based on the “Clinical Frailty Scale” (CFS), patients were classified into three groups according to the resulting score: 1-3 (group A), 4-6 (group B), 7-9 (group C). Results Overall, 206 patients were included. Crude mortality was 27%. According to CFS, on admission, 60 patients (29%) were assigned to group A, 60 (29%) to group B, and 86 (42%) to group C. The following features were significantly more frequent among group C patients in comparison with groups B and A: mental confusion (65% vs 33% vs 7%, respectively, p < .001), kidney failure (39% vs 22% vs 20%, p = .019), dehydration syndrome (55% vs 27% vs 13%, p < .001), electrolyte imbalance (54% vs 32% vs 25%, p = .001), and diabetic decompensation (22% vs 12% vs 7%, p = .026). By multivariable logistic regression model, male sex (aOR = 2.87, 95%CI = 1.15–7.18), CFS between 7 and 9 (aOR = 9.97, 95%CI = 1.82–52.99), dehydration at admission (aOR = 4.27, 95%CI = 1.72–10.57), and non-invasive/invasive ventilation (aOR = 4.88, 95%CI = 1.94–12-26) were independent predictors of death. Conclusions Elderly with a high CFS showed frequent extrapulmonary signsat admission, even in absence of lung involvement.

647;Assessing climate-induced agricultural vulnerable coastal communities of Bangladesh using machine learning techniques;10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140255;Abstract The agricultural arena in the coastal regions of South-East Asian countries is experiencing the mounting pressures of the adverse effects of climate change. Controlling and predicting climatic factors are difficult and require expensive solutions. The study focuses on identifying issues other than climatic factors using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) to measure agricultural vulnerability. Factors such as monthly savings of the farmers, income opportunities, damage to cultivable lands, and water availability had significant impacts on increasing community vulnerability with regards to agricultural practice. The study also identified the need for assessing vulnerability after certain intervals, specifically owing to the dynamic nature of the coastal region where the factors were found to vary among the different study areas. The development of a climate-resilient livelihood vulnerability assessment tool to detect the most significant factors to assess agricultural vulnerability was done using machine learning (ML) techniques. The ML techniques identified nine significant factors out of 21 based on the minimum level of standard deviation (0.03). A practical application of the outcome of the study was the development of a mobile application. Custom REST APIs (application programming interface) were developed on the backend to seamlessly sync the app to a server, thus ensuring the acquisition of future data without much effort and resources. The paper provides a methodology for a unique vulnerability assessment technique using a mobile application, which can be used for the planning and management of resources by different stakeholders in a sustainable way.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140255; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720337761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32721709/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720337761?v=s5";16/06/2020;Livelihood Vulnerability Index;0.9444
648;Telehealth in inflammatory bowel disease;10.1111/imj.15068;BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients living in regional or remote Queensland are often disadvantaged by limited access to IBD specialist care. Telehealth clinics could potentially address this disparity and improve patient outcomes. AIM: We report the impact of the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) IBD telehealth clinics from March 2011 to December 2017 including patient satisfaction and healthcare activity. METHODS: Patient satisfaction surveys were collected prospectively between March 2011 and March 2012. Healthcare activity was assessed through occasions of service (OOS), number of enrolled patients on biologics and IBD related admissions to RBWH. RESULTS: Overall, 3764 OOS were completed including 576 new patient and 3188 follow up visits. Mean age at first telehealth visit was 44 years (range:16‐87). The IBD telehealth clinics were well accepted with 99% of the first 153 patients surveyed choosing to continue with telehealth and 94% rated the telehealth experience as very good or excellent. The net number of patients under active review increased from 125 patients in 2011 to 345 patients in 2017. Enrolled patients on biologics also increased from 9 patients in 2011 to 63 patients in 2017. There was an initial dip in annual IBD related admissions to RBWH in 2011 but these have progressively increased over time although the average length of inpatient stay annually has remained stable. CONCLUSION: The RBWH IBD telehealth clinics have shown that telemedicine is well received and can be used successfully to deliver IBD specialist care to patients living in regional or remote areas.

649;Validity of Wrist and Forehead Temperature in Temperature Screening in the General Population During the Outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus: a prospective real-world study;10.1101/2020.03.02.20030148;"Aims: Temperature screening is important in the population during the outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature ≥37.3C. Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61C for the wrist measurements. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P <0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P <0.001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature ≥37.3C was 36.2C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity. Conclusions: Wrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients.

650;Navigating the COVID-19 Crisis to Sustain Community-Based Malaria Interventions in Cambodia.;10.9745/ghsp-d-20-00528;Cambodia has made impressive progress in reducing malaria trends and, in 2018, reported no malaria-related deaths for the first time. However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents a potential challenge to the country's goal for malaria elimination by 2025. The path toward malaria elimination depends on sustained interventions to prevent rapid resurgence, which can quickly set back any gains achieved.Malaria Consortium supported mobile malaria workers (MMWs) to engage with target communities to build acceptance, trust, and resilience. At the start of the pandemic, Malaria Consortium conducted a COVID-19 risk assessment and quickly developed and implemented a mitigation plan to ensure MMWs were able to continue providing malaria services without putting themselves or their patients at risk. Changes in malaria intervention coverage and community uptake have been monitored to gauge the indirect effects of COVID-19. Comparisons have been made between output indicators reported in 2020 and from the same month-period of the previous year.In general, malaria service intervention coverage and utilization rates did not decline in 2020. Rather, the reported figures show there was a substantial increase in service utilization. Preliminary internal reviews and community meetings show that despite a heightened public risk perception toward COVID-19, malaria testing motivation has been well sustained throughout the pandemic. This may be attributable to proactive program planning and data monitoring and active engagement with the communities and the national authorities to circumvent the indirect effect of COVID-19 on intervention coverage in Cambodia during the pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.9745/ghsp-d-20-00528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989171/";13/05/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9396
651;Pooling of Upper Respiratory Specimens Using a SARS-CoV-2 Real Time RT-PCR Assay Authorized for Emergency Use in Low Prevalence Populations for High-Throughput Testing;10.1093/ofid/ofaa466;"BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid amplification testing is a critical tool for addressing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Specimen pooling can increase throughput and conserve testing resources but requires validation to ensure that reduced sensitivity does not increase the false-negative rate. We evaluated the performance of a real time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use for pooled testing of upper respiratory specimens. METHODS: Positive specimens were selected from three prevalence groups, 1-3%, >3-6%, and >6-10%. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was assessed by pooling single-positive specimens with three negative specimens; performance was assessed using Passing-Bablok regression. Additionally, we assessed the distributions of RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for 3,091 positive specimens. RESULTS: PPA was 100% for the 101 pooled specimens. There was a linear relationship between Ct values for pooled and single-tested specimens (r: 0.96-0.99, slope ≈ 1). The mean pooled Ct shifts at 40 cycles were 2.38 and 1.90 respectively for the N1 and N3 targets. The median Cts for 3,091 positive specimens were 25.9 (N1) and 24.7 (N3). The percent of positive specimens with Cts between 40 and the shifted Ct was 1.42% (N1) and 0.0% (N3). CONCLUSIONS: Pooled and individual testing of specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated 100% agreement and demonstrate the viability of pooled specimens for SARS-COV-2 testing using a dual-target RT-PCR system. Pooled specimen testing can help increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2, with a low risk of false-negative results.";"https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204756/";29/09/2020;Nucleic acid amplification testing;0.9654
652;Successful treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia with clazakizumab in a heart transplant recipient: case report;10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.06.003;Abstract Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by an overwhelming cytokine response. Various treatment strategies have been attempted. Methods and Results A 61-year-old male with heart transplantation in 2017 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea, and confirmed positive for the SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). Laboratory tests showed significant elevations in C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Echocardiogram showed LVEF 58% (with EF 57% 6 months prior). Given the lack of clear management guidelines, the patient was initially managed symptomatically. However, the patient subsequently had a rapid respiratory deterioration with worsening inflammatory markers on day 5 of admission. Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) was in low supply in the hospital. The patient was offered clazakizumab (anti-IL-6) for compassionate use. Patient received 25 mg intravenously x1 dose. Within 24 hours, he noted significant improvement in symptoms, oxygen requirements, radiological findings and inflammatory markers. There was a transient leukopenia which improved in 4 days. He was discharged home on day 11, with negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR as an outpatient on day 35, development of positive serum COVID-19 IgG antibody, and he continued to do well on day 60, with no heart-related symptoms. Conclusion Clazakizumab is a monoclonal antibody against human IL-6, which may be helpful in inhibiting the cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19. Although not yet FDA approved, it is being investigated for treatment of renal antibody-mediated rejection. Clinical trials of clazakizumab for treatment of COVID-19 are underway worldwide.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.06.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041134520325756?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32563584/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041134520325756";07/06/2020;SARS-CoV-2 disease;0.9485
653;A nationwide, multi-center, retrospective study of symptomatic small bowel stricture in patients with Crohn's disease.;10.1007/s00535-020-01670-2;"BACKGROUND Small bowel stricture is one of the most common complications in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD) is a minimally invasive treatment intended to avoid surgery; however, whether EBD prevents subsequent surgery remains unclear. We aimed to reveal the factors contributing to surgery in patients with small bowel stricture and the factors associated with subsequent surgery after initial EBD. METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from surgically untreated CD patients who developed symptomatic small bowel stricture after 2008 when the use of balloon-assisted enteroscopy and maintenance therapy with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) became available. RESULTS A total of 305 cases from 32 tertiary referral centers were enrolled. Cumulative surgery-free survival was 74.0% at 1 year, 54.4% at 5 years, and 44.3% at 10 years. The factors associated with avoiding surgery were non-stricturing, non-penetrating disease at onset, mild severity of symptoms, successful EBD, stricture length < 2 cm, and immunomodulator or anti-TNF added after onset of obstructive symptoms. In 95 cases with successful initial EBD, longer EBD interval was associated with lower risk of surgery. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that an EBD interval of ≤ 446 days predicted subsequent surgery, and the proportion of smokers was significantly high in patients who required frequent dilatation. CONCLUSIONS In CD patients with symptomatic small bowel stricture, addition of immunomodulator or anti-TNF and smoking cessation may improve the outcome of symptomatic small bowel stricture, by avoiding frequent EBD and subsequent surgery after initial EBD.";"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-020-01670-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31989252/";27/01/2020;Small bowel stricture;0.921
654;Evaluation of alpha defensin, IL‐1 receptor antagonist, and IL‐18 levels in COVID‐19 patients with macrophage activation syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome;10.1002/jmv.26589;BACKGROUND: Many laboratory parameters have been associated with morbidity and mortality in SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19), which emerged in an animal market in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has infected over 20 million people. This study investigated the relationship between serum interleukin (IL)‐18, IL‐1 receptor antagonist (IL‐1Ra), and alpha defensin levels and the clinical course and prognosis of COVID‐19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 100 patients who were admitted to the chest diseases department and intensive care unit of our hospital and diagnosed with COVID‐19 by real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal swab samples between March 24 and May 31, 2020. The control group consisted of 50 nonsymptomatic health workers with negative real‐time PCR results in routine COVID‐19 screening in our hospital. RESULTS: Serum alpha defensin, IL‐1Ra, and IL‐18 levels were significantly higher in patients who developed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to patients who did not (p < .001 for all). Alpha defensin, IL‐1Ra, and IL‐18 levels were significantly higher in COVID‐19 patients with and without MAS or ARDS when compared to the control group (p < .001 for all). When the 9 patients who died were compared with the 91 surviving patients, IL‐1Ra and IL‐18 levels were found to be significantly higher in the nonsurvivors (p < .001). CONCLUSION: Our findings of correlations between alpha defensin and levels of IL‐1Ra and IL‐18, which were previously shown to be useful in COVID‐19 treatment and follow‐up, indicates that it may also be promising in treatment.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038012/";30/10/2020;SARS‐CoV‐2;0.9829
655;Diagnostic accuracy of Augurix COVID‐19 IgG serology rapid test;10.1111/eci.13357;"AIMS: To validate the diagnostic accuracy of the Augurix SARS‐CoV‐2 IgM/IgG rapid immunoassay diagnostic test (RDT) for COVID‐19. METHODS: In this unmatched 1:1 case‐control study, blood samples from 46 real‐time RT‐PCR‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 hospitalized cases and 45 healthy donors (negative controls) were studied. Diagnostic accuracy of the IgG RDT was assessed against both an in‐house recombinant spike‐expressing immunofluorescence assay (rIFA), as an established reference method (primary endpoint), and the Euroimmun SARS‐CoV2 IgG enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (secondary endpoint). RESULTS: COVID‐19 patients were more likely to be male (61% versus 20%; p=0.0001) and older (median 66 versus 47 years‐old; p<0.001) than controls. Whole blood IgG‐RDT results showed 86% and 93% overall Kendall concordance with rIFA and IgG ELISA, respectively. IgG RDT performances were similar between plasma and whole blood. Overall, RDT sensitivity was 88% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 70‐96), specificity 98% (95%CI: 90‐100), PPV 97% (95%CI: 80‐100) and NPV 94% (95%CI: 84‐98). The IgG‐RDT carried out from 0 to 6 days, 7 to 14 days and >14 days after the SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR test displayed 30%, 73% and 100% positivity rates in the COVID‐19 group, respectively. When considering samples taken >14 days after RT‐PCR diagnosis, NPV was 100% (95%CI:90‐100), and PPV was 100% (95%CI:72‐100). CONCLUSIONS: The Augurix IgG‐RDT done in whole blood displays a high diagnostic accuracy for SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG in high COVID‐19 prevalence settings, where its use could be considered in the absence of routine diagnostic serology facilities.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691863/; https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13357";21/07/2020;rapid immunoassay diagnostic test;0.938
656;Modelling and Experimental Assessment of Inter-Personal Distancing Based on Shared GNSS Observables;10.3390/s21082588;In the last few years, all countries worldwide have fought the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) by exploiting Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to perform contact tracing. In parallel, the pandemic has highlighted the relevance of mobility and social distancing among citizens. The monitoring of such aspects appeared prominent for reactive decision-making and the effective tracking of the infection chain. In parallel to the proximity sensing among people, indeed, the concept of social distancing has captured the attention to signal processing algorithms enabling short-to-medium range distance estimation to provide behavioral models in the emergency. By exploiting the availability of smart devices, the synergy between mobile network connectivity and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), cooperative ranging approaches allow computing inter-personal distance measurements in outdoor environments through the exchange of light-weight navigation data among interconnected users. In this paper, a model for Inter-Agent Ranging (IAR) is provided and experimentally assessed to offer a naive collaborative distancing technique that leverages these features. Although the technique provides distance information, it does not imply the disclosure of the user’s locations being intrinsically prone to protect sensitive user data. A statistical error model is presented and validated through synthetic simulations and real, on-field experiments to support implementation in GNSS-equipped mobile devices. Accuracy and precision of IAR measurements are compared to other consolidated GNSS-based techniques showing comparable performance at lower complexity and computational effort.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33917083/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21082588";07/04/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.9901
657;New-onset atrial fibrillation and associated outcomes and resource use among critically ill adults—a multicenter retrospective cohort study;10.1186/s13054-020-2730-0;BACKGROUND: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is commonly encountered in critically ill adults. Evidence evaluating the association between NOAF and patient-important outcomes in this population is conflicting. Furthermore, little is known regarding the association between NOAF and resource use or hospital costs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis (2011–2016) of a prospectively collected registry from two Canadian hospitals of consecutive ICU patients aged ≥ 18 years. We excluded patients with a known history of AF prior to hospital admission. Any occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) was prospectively recorded by bedside nurses. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and we used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for confounders. We used a generalized linear model to evaluate contributors to total cost. RESULTS: We included 15,014 patients, and 1541 (10.3%) had NOAF during their ICU admission. While NOAF was not associated with increased odds of hospital death among the entire cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.02 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97–1.08]), an interaction was noted between NOAF and sepsis, and the presence of both was associated with higher odds of hospital mortality (aOR 1.28 [95% CI 1.09–1.36]) than either alone. Patients with NOAF had higher total costs (cost ratio [CR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.02–1.20]). Among patients with NOAF, treatment with a rhythm-control strategy was associated with higher costs (CR 1.24 [95% CI 1.07–1.40]). CONCLUSIONS: While NOAF was not associated with death or requiring discharge to long-term care among critically ill patients, it was associated with increased length of stay in ICU and increased total costs.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6958729/;13/01/2020;New-onset atrial fibrillation;0.9181
658;Lasting modulation of human cortical swallowing motor pathways following thermal tongue stimulation.;10.1111/nmo.13938;BACKGROUND Thermal tactile oropharyngeal stimulation has been clinically used to facilitate swallowing initiation in dysphagic patients. We previously demonstrated that thermal stimulation applied to the oral cavity provokes an immediate excitability in pharyngeal motor cortex. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether thermal stimulation can produce longer lasting effects on the corticopharyngeal neural pathway. METHODS Healthy volunteers (n = 8/12) underwent baseline pharyngeal motor evoked potential (PMEP) measurements evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation. In the first experiment, subjects received thermal stimulation alternating 30 seconds of 15 and 36°C applied to the tongue surface for either 10 minutes, 5 minutes, or sham. In the second experiment, one of three intermittent thermal stimulus patterns was delivered: cold (alternating 30 seconds of 15 and 36°C), warm (continuous 36°C), or hot (alternating 30 seconds of 45 and 36°C) for 10 minutes. In both experiments, PMEP were remeasured every 15 minutes up to 60 minutes following thermal stimulation. KEY RESULTS Repeated measures ANOVA for each stimulus time in the first experiment showed a significant increased change in PMEP amplitude at 30 minutes following only 10-minute stimulation compared with sham (P < .05). In the second experiment, we found that cold stimulation was more effective than the other stimulation (P < .05) at increasing PMEP amplitudes. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES Ten-minute cold stimulation on the tongue can induce a delayed (30 minutes) increase in pharyngeal cortical excitability, providing a clinically useful therapeutic window for its application in dysphagic patients.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32656920/";12/07/2020;Thermal tactile oropharyngeal stimulation;0.9492
659;Sex disparities in COVID-19 outcomes of inpatients with diabetes: insights from the CORONADO study.;10.1530/eje-21-0068;OBJECTIVE Male sex is a determinant of severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to characterize sex differences in severe outcomes in adults with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS We performed a sex-stratified analysis of clinical and biological features and outcomes (i.e. invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV], death, intensive care unit [ICU] admission and home discharge at day 7 [D7] or day 28 [D28]) in 2,380 patients with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19 and included in the nationwide CORONADO observational study (NCT04324736). RESULTS The study population was predominantly male (63.5%). After multiple adjustments, female sex was negatively associated with the primary outcome (IMV and/or death, OR 0.66 [0.49-0.88]), death (OR 0.49 [0.30-0.79]) and ICU admission (OR 0.57 [0.43-0.77]) at D7, but only with ICU admission (OR 0.58 [0.43-0.77]) at D28. Older age and a history of microvascular complications were predictors of death at D28 in both sexes, while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was predictive of death in women only. At admission, CRP, AST and eGFR predicted death in both sexes. Lymphocytopenia was an independent predictor of death in women only, while thrombocytopenia and elevated plasma glucose concentration were predictors of death in men only. CONCLUSIONS In patients with diabetes admitted for COVID-19, female sex was associated with lower incidence of early severe outcomes, but did not influence the overall in-hospital mortality, suggesting that diabetes mitigates the female protection from COVID-19 severity. Sex-associated biological determinants may be useful to optimize COVID-19 prevention and management in women and men.;"https://doi.org/10.1530/eje-21-0068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34085949/";01/06/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9253
660;The retina as a window to the basal ganglia: Systematic review of the potential link between retinopathy and hyperkinetic disorders in diabetes.;10.1016/j.parkreldis.2020.10.025;There is evidence that glycemic fluctuations trigger vascular-mediated dysfunction in both the retina and the striatopallidal regions in patients with diabetes. The latter is associated with a variety of hyperkinetic disorders that are rare but disabling and potentially preventable. We conducted a systematic review of the potential association between diabetic retinopathy and the risk and prognosis of hyperkinetic disorders in patients with diabetes. We identified a total of 461 articles and 147 were eligible for review. Nine out of 147 articles (6.12%) reported 13 patients with information on diabetic retinopathy. Glycemic fluctuations were present at onset in 10 patients (77%) and retinopathy was present in nine of them (69.23%). The degree of retinopathy was reported in four patients. Two had severe, bilateral proliferative retinopathy, one had moderate-to-severe non-proliferative retinopathy and one had non-proliferative retinopathy. In the nine patients with retinopathy, hyperkinesia persisted, required higher doses of dopamine receptor antagonists or deep brain stimulation. Retinopathy was absent in four cases (30.77%). In these patients, hyperkinesia resolved spontaneously or with lower doses of dopamine receptor antagonists. Diabetic retinopathy could be an indirect marker of striatopallidal microangiopathy in patients with diabetes. The severity of retinopathy may be associated with increased risk or worse prognosis for patients who develop hyperkinetic disorders of the diabetic striatopathy spectrum. Early detection of retinopathy could identify patients in which avoiding glycemic fluctuations may prevent the development of striatopathy and hyperkinetic disorders.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parkreldis.2020.10.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069611/";13/10/2020;deep brain stimulation;0.9593

Tocilizumab, an IL-6 antagonist has been used in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with conflicting results from different parts of the world. We conducted a retrospective descriptive study from Feb 2020 to May 2020 on COVID-19 patients with ARDS and hyperinflammation characterized by raised CRP and/or ferritin. A total of 244 patients with COVID-19 were admitted out of which 107 had ARDS. Thirty patients had both ARDS and hyperinflammation and received tocilizumab. The mean age was 62.5 years (SD: 13.5) and the majority were male (83%). The mean CRP pre-treatment was 217.5 mg/L and post 48 to 72 hours of tocilizumab treatment was 98.5 mg/L. Twenty-one patients (70%) also received concomitant intravenous methylprednisolone. Of the 30 patients, 7 died and 20 recovered. Ten patients required intensive care unit admission and nine developed nosocomial infections. COVID-19 associated aspergillosis was diagnosed in three patients post tocilizumab treatment.

662;Molecular mechanism of inhibition of COVID-19 main protease by β-adrenoceptor agonists and adenosine deaminase inhibitors using in silico methods;10.1080/07391102.2020.1868337;Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) responsible for viral pneumonia which emerged in late 2019 has badly affected the world. No clinically proven drugs are available yet as the targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease. The viral main protease which helps in replication and transcription inside the host can be an effective drug target. In the present study, we aimed to discover the potential of β-adrenoceptor agonists and adenosine deaminase inhibitors which are used in asthma and cancer/inflammatory disorders, respectively, as repurposing drugs against protease inhibitor by ligand-based and structure-based virtual screening using COVID-19 protease-N3 complex. The AARRR pharmacophore model was used to screen a set of 22,621 molecules to obtain hits, which were subjected to high-throughput virtual screening. Extra precision docking identified four top-scored molecules such as +/−-fenoterol, FR236913 and FR230513 with lower binding energy from both categories. Docking identified three major hydrogen bonds with Gly143, Glu166 and Gln189 residues. 100 ns MD simulation was performed for four top-scored molecules to analyze the stability, molecular mechanism and energy requirements. MM/PBSA energy calculation suggested that van der Waals and electrostatic energy components are the main reasons for the stability of complexes. Water-mediated hydrogen bonds between protein-ligand and flexibility of the ligand are found to be responsible for providing extra stability to the complexes. The insights gained from this combinatorial approach can be used to design more potent and bio-available protease inhibitors against novel coronavirus. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

663;Capturing respiratory syncytial virus season in Belgium using the influenza severe acute respiratory infection surveillance network, season 2018/19;10.2807/1560-7917.es.2020.25.39.1900627;BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of severe respiratory illness in young children (< 5 years old) and older adults (≥ 65 years old) leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend the implementation of a dedicated surveillance in countries. AIM: We tested the capacity of the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) hospital network to contribute to RSV surveillance in Belgium. METHODS: During the 2018/19 influenza season, we started the SARI surveillance for influenza in Belgium in week 40, earlier than in the past, to follow RSV activity, which usually precedes influenza virus circulation. While the WHO SARI case definition for influenza normally used by the SARI hospital network was employed, flexibility over the fever criterion was allowed, so patients without fever but meeting the other case definition criteria could be included in the surveillance. RESULTS: Between weeks 40 2018 and 2 2019, we received 508 samples from SARI patients. We found an overall RSV detection rate of 62.4% (317/508), with rates varying depending on the age group: 77.6% in children aged < 5 years (253/326) and 34.4% in adults aged ≥ 65 years (44/128). Over 90% of the RSV-positive samples also positive for another tested respiratory virus (80/85) were from children aged < 5 years. Differences were also noted between age groups for symptoms, comorbidities and complications. CONCLUSION: With only marginal modifications in the case definition and the period of surveillance, the Belgian SARI network would be able to substantially contribute to RSV surveillance and burden evaluation in children and older adults, the two groups of particular interest for WHO.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006303/; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2020.25.39.1900627";01/10/2020;Respiratory syncytial virus;0.9311
664;Spinal cord injuries and bowel stomas: timing and satisfaction with stoma formation and alterations in quality of life;10.1038/s41394-020-00377-z;STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVES: Neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) is frequent among individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) and is often difficult to treat. A bowel stoma is considered the last-resort treatment option for individuals with SCI and severe NBD. This study aims to explore whether individuals are satisfied with their bowel stoma and how they feel about the timing of stoma formation. Furthermore, we want to explore side effects addressing diversion colitis and changes in quality of life (QOL) after stoma formation. SETTING: Netherlands, community. METHODS: We included participants aged at least 18 years with a traumatic or non-traumatic SCI and bowel stoma. Questions regarding timing of stoma formation, alterations in QOL after stoma formation and experienced side effects of the bowel stoma were addressed in an online questionnaire. RESULTS: In total 23 participants filled out the online survey. Twenty-two participants (96%) were satisfied with their bowel stoma and 83% felt their stoma was placed too late or far too late. The large majority (>80%) reported improvements in the four QOL domains after the procedure. Nine participants reported stoma-related problems in the last month. In the last three months, seven participants (30%) reported to have diversion colitis. Four of these seven participants experienced this at least once a week or more. Two participants stated this had moderate influence on daily activities. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants with SCI experienced improvement in QOL and in retrospect wanted their bowel stoma earlier. Early, extensive conversations to inform individuals about bowel stoma as a treatment option is recommended.;"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41394-020-00377-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536415/";03/02/2021;Neurogenic bowel dysfunction;0.9247

Unnecessary antibiotic use increases the risk of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, prolonged antibiotic use increases the risk of mortality and morbidity in neonates. Proactive measures including empiric antibiotic de-escalation are crucial to overcome these problems. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study conducted in the neonatal intensive care units of two public hospitals in Malaysia. Neonates with a gestational age greater than 34 weeks who were started on empiric antibiotics within 72 h of life were screened. The data were then stratified according to de-escalation and non-de-escalation practices, where de-escalation practice was defined as narrowing down or discontinuation of empiric antibiotic within 72 h of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 1045 neonates were screened, and 429 were included. The neonates were then divided based on de-escalation (n = 207) and non-de-escalation (n = 222) practices. Neonates under non-de-escalation practices showed significantly longer durations of antibiotic use compared to those under de-escalation practices (p < 0.05), with no difference in treatment outcomes. Five factors were found to be associated with de-escalation of antibiotics. They are cesarean section delivery, exposure to antenatal steroids, nil history of maternal pyrexia, absence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and normal C-reactive protein ≤ 0.5 mg/dL (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Empiric antibiotic de-escalation appears feasible as a routine form of treatment for EOS in late preterm and term neonates.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222079/;18/03/2020;Prolonged empiric antibiotic use;0.9659
666;Successful second outpatient autologous hematopoietic cell transplant for relapsed POEMS syndrome in a patient with coexisting HIV, HBV and syphilis infections during the COVID-19 pandemic.;10.1016/j.trim.2021.101412;Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a multisystem autoinflammatory disease due to an underlying plasma cell disorder that lacks a standard treatment strategy because of its rarity. We report a case of relapsed POEMS syndrome successfully treated with a second ambulatory autologous hematopoietic-cell transplantation (AHCT) after a daratumumab desensitization protocol performed during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in a patient with coexisting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and syphilis infections. He is a 37-year old Latin-American male who had been treated with radiation, CyBorD regimen, AHCT and bortezomib therapy before being referred to our service. It was decided to administer daratumumab therapy and subsequently perform the transplant. Placement of central venous access, fluid infusion, conditioning regimen with melphalan and previously cryopreserved autograft infusion were carried out in an outpatient basis. Following second AHCT, the patient demonstrated clinical, VEGF, hematological response and remains SARS-CoV-2 infection-free and in POEMS remission with excellent quality-of-life at last follow up (6 months). We evidenced that thanks to an outpatient transplant program, the best therapeutic modalities can be offered to patients with hematologic malignancies in the context of present or future pandemics. Finally, high-complexity patients with HIV infection should have access to the same treatment strategies as non-infected patients. A second AHCT in the outpatient setting is feasible, safe and highly effective to treat patients with relapsed POEMS syndrome.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trim.2021.101412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020046/";18/05/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9626
667;Sterenin M as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease identified from MeFSAT database using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation()()();10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104568;The disease outbreak of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, remains a public health concern. COVID-19 is spreading rapidly with a high mortality rate due to unavailability of effective treatment or vaccine for the disease. The high rate of mutation and recombination in SARS-CoV2 makes it difficult for scientist to develop specific anti-CoV2 drugs and vaccines. SARS-CoV-2-Mpro cleaves the viral polyprotein to produce a variety of non-structural proteins, but in human host it also cleaves the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) essential modulator (NEMO), which suppresses the activation of the NF-κB pathway and weakens the immune response. Since the main protease (Mpro) is required for viral gene expression and replication, it is a promising target for antagonists to treat novel coronavirus disease and discovery of high resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-Mpro provide an opportunity for in silico identification of its possible inhibitors. In this study we intend to find novel and potential Mpro inhibitors from around 1830 chemically diverse and therapeutically important secondary metabolites available in the MeFSAT database by performing molecular docking against the Mpro structure of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6LZE). After ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profile and binding energy calculation through MM-GBSA for top five hits, Sterenin M was proposed as a SARS-CoV2-Mpro inhibitor with validation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Sterenin M seems to have the potential to be a promising ligand against SARS-CoV-2, and thus it requires further validation by in vitro and in vivo studies.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174757/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521003620?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521003620; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104568";12/06/2021;Coronavirus disease-19;0.9299
668;Detection of community‐acquired respiratory viruses in allogeneic stem‐cell transplant recipients and controls—A prospective cohort study;10.1111/tid.13415;BACKGROUND: Community‐acquired respiratory viruses (CARV) cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTI/LRTI) and may be life‐threatening for recipients of an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo‐SCT). METHODS: In a prospective study encompassing 4 winter‐seasons, we collected throat gargles (TG) at random time points from allo‐SCT recipients (patients) and controls and followed them up for at least 3 weeks including repetitive sampling and documentation of symptoms. A Multiplex‐PCR system to identify 20 CARV and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was used to detect CARV. RESULTS: One hundred ninety‐four patients with 426 TG and 273 controls with 549 TG were included. There were more patients with a positive test result (25% vs 11% in the controls), and the patients had a higher number of positive TG (70 = 16%) compared to controls (32 = 6%) (P < .001). Altogether, 115 viruses were detected. Multiple viruses in one TG (11/48, 34%) and prolonged shedding were only observed in patients (13/48, 27%). Patients had more RSV (18/83, 26%) and adenovirus (15/83, 21%) than controls (both viruses 2/32, 6%). Independent risk factors for the detection of CARV included age >40 years (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.8‐6.4, P < .001) and presence of URTI‐symptoms (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.9‐5.5, P < .001). No controls developed a LRTI or died whereas 4/48 (8%) patients developed a LRTI (coronavirus in 2, RSV in 1 and influenza A H1N1 in 1 patient). One patient died of CARV (influenza A H1N1). CONCLUSION: Allo‐SCT‐recipients have more CARV‐infections, exhibit a different epidemiology, have more cases of co‐infection or prolonged shedding and have a higher rate of LRTI and mortality.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32779843/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13415";23/07/2020;Community‐acquired respiratory viruses;0.9914
669;Contribution of Research in the West Indies and Northeast Amazonia to Knowledge of the 2014–2015 Chikungunya Epidemic in the Americas;10.1007/s40475-021-00242-5;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although the chikungunya virus was discovered more than 60 years ago, it has only really been studied since the outbreak in La Reunion in 2005–2006. Ten years later, between 2014 and 2015, the chikungunya virus spread throughout the Americas, affecting millions of people. The objective of this review is to describe the contributions of research on chikungunya virus infection gained from epidemic in the West Indies and the Guiana Shield. RECENT FINDINGS: Prevalence data were similar to those found in the Indian Ocean or Asia during epidemics. Clinically, there is now a better understanding of the typical, atypical, and severe forms. Several studies have insisted on the presence of neurological forms of chikungunya infection, such as encephalitis or Guillain–Barré syndrome. Cases of septic shock due to chikungunya virus as well as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura were described for the first time. Given the magnitude of the epidemic and the large number of people affected, this has led to a better description and new classifications of chikungunya virus infections in specific populations such as pregnant women, the elderly, and children. Several studies also described the behavior of populations faced with an emerging disease. SUMMARY: Current epidemiological data from tropical regions highlights the risk of spreading emerging diseases at higher latitudes, especially concerning arboviruses, since the vector Aedes albopictus is already established in many parts of northern countries. A better understanding of the disease and its epidemic dynamics will foster better management, the crucial importance of which was demonstrated during the COVID-19 epidemic.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00242-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178576/";19/06/2021;PURPOSE OF REVIEW;0.9105
670;Myocardial injury in a patient with severe coronavirus disease: A case report();10.1016/j.jiac.2020.09.023;INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can lead to severe disease or death and is characterized by a wide range of mild to severe symptoms. In addition to the lungs, studies have reported the involvement of the stomach, intestine, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in the heart. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who died soon after developing multi-organ failure and myocardial injury due to COVID-19-associated pneumonia. A 71-year-old man who contracted COVID-19 was admitted to the hospital after presenting with fever for 7 days and developed dyspnea. Following treatment, his respiratory status worsened. Thus, he was transferred to our hospital for intensive care on day 11. Physical examination revealed fever, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and no chest pain. Invasive positive pressure ventilation was initiated for acute respiratory distress syndrome on day 14. On day 15, we observed renal, liver, and coagulation dysfunction, indicating multi-organ failure. Chest radiography did not show clear signs of an increased cardiothoracic ratio or pulmonary congestion. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of myocardial infarction, which was confirmed by elevated troponin I and creatine kinase levels. The patient's circulatory dynamics did not improve on medication, and he died on day 16. CONCLUSIONS: We report the case of a patient with severe COVID-19 who died from an exacerbation of myocardial injury. Clinicians should not only evaluate respiration but also assess the heart by performing a 12-lead ECG, echocardiogram, and myocardial injury marker examination. Together, these tools can help predict which patients will develop severe COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.09.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33036894/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X20303433; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X20303433";06/10/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9679
671;Wild food plants and fungi sold in the markets of Luang Prabang, Lao PDR;10.1186/s13002-020-00423-y;BACKGROUND: Open air markets hold an important position for ethnobiologists. In Southeast Asia, they are seriously understudied, in spite of their incredible biocultural diversity. In order to fill this gap we recorded plants and fungi sold in the open air markets of Luang Prabang, Lao PDR. METHODS: The markets were visited 38 times in four seasons: the dry season, early monsoon, mid-monsoon, and end-of-monsoon, at least 8 times per season. All items were photographed and voucher specimens were collected. Fungi were identified using DNA barcoding techniques. RESULTS: We recorded 110 species of wild edible plants and 54 species of fungi, including 49 wild-collected species. The sold plants included 86 species of green vegetables, 18 species of fruits and 3 species of flowers. Products from woody species constitute around half of all taxa sold. These include the young shoots of tree leaves, which are used for salads—an interesting feature of Lao cuisine. A large number of extremely rare Russula, with no reference sequences represented in databases or even species unknown to science is present on sale in the markets. CONCLUSIONS: Luang Prabang markets are some of the richest in species of wild edible plants and fungi in Asia, and indeed in the whole world. It is worth pointing out the exceptionally long list of wild edible mushrooms which are sold in Luang Prabang (and probably elsewhere in Laos). We view the Morning Market of Luang Prabang as a cultural treasure that unites the traditions of eating a large number of living species with very diverse flora and fauna. Measures should be taken to strike a balance between local foraging traditions and nature conservation priorities.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33499871/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13002-020-00423-y";26/01/2021;Open air markets;0.966
672;Extending influenza surveillance to detect non-influenza respiratory viruses of public health relevance: analysis of surveillance data, 2015-2019, Belgium;10.1101/2021.01.13.20202200;BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI) affects millions of people yearly. Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), mainly caused by influenza, are a leading cause of hospitalisation and mortality. Increasing evidence indicates that non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRVs) also contribute to the burden of SARI. In Belgium, SARI surveillance by a network of sentinel hospitals is ongoing since 2011. AIM: Here, we report the results of using in-house multiplex PCRs for the detection of a flexible panel of viruses in respiratory ILI and SARI samples and the estimated incidence rates of SARI associated to each virus. METHODS: ILI was defined as an infection with onset of fever and cough or dyspnoea. SARI was defined as an infection requiring hospitalization with onset of fever and cough or dyspnoea within the previous 10 days. Samples were collected during four winter seasons and tested by multiplex RT-qPCRs for influenza virus and NIRVs. Using catchment population estimates, incidence rates of SARI associated to each virus were calculated. RESULTS: One third of the SARI cases were positive for NIRVs, reaching 49.4% among children under fifteen. In children under five, incidence rates of NIRV-associated SARI were double that of influenza (103.4 versus 57.6 per 100000 person-months), with NIRV co-infections, respiratory syncytial viruses, human metapneumoviruses and picornaviruses contributing the most (33.1, 13.6, 15.8 and 18.2 per 100000 person-months, respectively). CONCLUSION: Early testing for NIRVs could be beneficial to clinical management of SARI patients, especially in children under five, for whom the burden of NIRV-associated disease exceeds that of influenza.;http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.20202200v1?rss=1;22/01/2021;Seasonal influenza-like illness;0.9152

A striking characteristic of COVID-19 infection in humans is the highly variable host response and the diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from clinically asymptomatic to severe immune reactions leading to hospitalization and death. Here we used a 3D genomic approach to analyse blood samples at the time of COVID diagnosis, from a global cohort of 80 COVID-19 patients, with different degrees of clinical disease outcomes. Using 3D whole genome EpiSwitch® arrays to generate over 1 million data points per patient, we identified a distinct and measurable set of differences in genomic organization at immune-related loci that demonstrated prognostic power at baseline to stratify patients with mild forms of illness and those with severe forms that required hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) support. Further analysis revealed both well established and new COVID-related dysregulated pathways and loci, including innate and adaptive immunity; ACE2; olfactory, Gβψ, Ca2+ and nitric oxide (NO) signalling; prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the acute inflammatory cytokine CCL3, and the T-cell derived chemotactic cytokine CCL5. We identified potential therapeutic agents for mitigation of severe disease outcome, with several already being tested independently, including mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and tacrolimus) and general immunosuppressants (dexamethasone and hydrocortisone). Machine learning algorithms based on established EpiSwitch® methodology further identified a subset of 3D genomic changes that could be used as prognostic molecular biomarker leads for the development of a COVID-19 disease severity test.";https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.14.435295;16/03/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9759
674;Pos Covid-19 And The Portuguese National Eye Care System Challenge;10.1016/j.optom.2020.05.001;Abstract The pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), had profound impact in many countries and their health care systems. Regarding Portugal, a suppression strategy with social distancing was adopted, attempting to break the transmission chains, bending the epidemy curve and reducing mortality. These measures seek to prevent an eventual National Health Service over-running, enforcing the suspension of all elective and non-urgent health care. Despite the success in so far, there is a consensus on the need to recover the previous level of health care provision and further enhance it. The Portuguese National Health Service, as a public, universal access, health care system funded by the State proved, in this context, its importance and relevance to the Portuguese population. However, long standing issues, such as the pre pandemic over long waiting lists for hospital ophthalmology attendance, whose determinants are fully identified but still unmet, emerge amplified from this pandemic. The lack of primary eye care in the National Health Service is a significant bottleneck, placing a huge stress on hospital-based care. An exclusive ophthalmologist’s centre care was over-runned before pandemic and will be even more so. The optometrist’s exclusion from differentiated, multisectoral and multidisciplinary eye care teams remains the main hurdle to overcome and insure universal eye care in Portugal. National Health Service highlights the consequences of an overcome model. Universal eye care more than ever demands an evidence-based, integrated approach with primary eye care, in the community, on time and of proximity.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optom.2020.05.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1888429620300492?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32711965/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1888429620300492";11/05/2020;coronavirus SARS-CoV-2;0.912

This project studied the impact of health emergency preparedness exercises (HEPEs) on the response to a mass casualty terrorist incident. The mixed methods study design was adopted comprising an on-line survey and follow up individual interviews. Participants were healthcare staff who took part in responses to three major terrorist incidents in the UK in 2017. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were undertaken with quantitative data. Content and thematic analysis methods were used for qualitative data analysis. The online survey generated 86 responses; 79 (92%) were from the responders to the Manchester Arena bombing. Twenty-one survey respondents shared their experiences in in-depth interviews. Healthcare staff who took part in HEPEs felt better prepared to respond than those who did not attend an exercise. The most commonly reported benefits from HEPEs were awareness of major incident plans and having the opportunity to practice responding to a similar scenario in the recent exercise. Specific benefits included: improved coordination of the response through adherence to recently practiced incident plans; confidence with response roles; real-time modifications of the response and support provided to staff who did not take part in exercises. Exercise recency was highlighted as an important facilitating factor. The study provides strong objective evidence that the response to a mass casualty terrorist incident was enhanced by training and service development achieved through HEPEs.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7709486/;05/06/2020;health emergency preparedness exercises;0.91
676;A mixed-methods sequential explanatory design comparison between COVID-19 infection control guidelines’ applicability and their protective value as perceived by Israeli healthcare workers, and healthcare executives’ response;10.1186/s13756-020-00812-8;BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are on the front line of the COVID-19 outbreak, and their constant exposure to infected patients and contaminated surfaces puts them at risk of acquiring and transmitting the infection. Therefore, they must employ protective measures. In practice, HCWs in Israel were not fully prepared for this sudden COVID-19 outbreak. This research aimed to identify and compare: (1) Israeli HCWs’ perceptions regarding the official COVID-19 guidelines’ applicability and their protective value, and (2) HCWs executives’ response to HWCs’ concern regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) shortage. METHODS: A mixed-methods sequential explanatory design consists of: (1) An online survey of 242 HCWs about the application of the guidelines and PPE, and (2) Personal interviews of 15 HCWs executives regarding PPE shortage and the measures they are taking to address it. RESULTS: A significant difference between the perceived applicability and protective value was found for most of the guidelines. Some of the guidelines were perceived as more applicable than protective (hand hygiene, signage at entrance, alcohol rub sanitizers at entrance, and mask for contact with symptomatic patients). Other were perceived as less applicable than protective (prohibited gathering of over 10 people, maintaining a distance of 2 m’, and remote services). CONCLUSIONS: HCWs need the support of the healthcare authorities not only to provide missing equipment, but also to communicate the risk to them. Conveying the information with full transparency, while addressing the uncertainty element and engaging the HCWs in evaluating the guidelines, are critical for establishing trust.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887658/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-020-00812-8";04/09/2020;Healthcare workers;0.9286

Supportive therapy remains the standard for mild-to-moderate cases, including treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) e.g. ibuprofen, however such medications may increase COVID-19 complications when used in patients with acute viral respiratory infections. P450 enzyme CYP2C9 are known to be involved in the metabolism of NSAIDs, however, their pharmacogenetic data are limited. This study aims to better understand the genetic landscape of CYP2C9 sequence variation across different ethnic and geographic groups, in correlation with ibuprofen dosing guidelines. A cohort of 101 Jordanian Arab samples were retrospectively recruited and genotyped using Affymetrix DMET Plus Premier Package. This study identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP2C9 in these Jordanian Arabs, within the context of over 100,000 global subjects in 417 published reports. Genetic structure analysis across populations revealed that Jordanian Arabs share the closest CYP2C9 sequence homology to Near East and European populations. However, European populations are 7.2x more likely to show impaired ibuprofen metabolism than Sub-Saharan populations, and 4.5x more likely than East Asian ancestry populations.. This is the most comprehensive and up-to-date analysis for CYP2C9 allele frequencies across multi-ethnic populations world-wide. The use of modern genomic tools coupled with a proactive assessment of the most likely gene-drug candidates will lead to a better understanding of the role of pharmacogenetics for COVID-19 and more effective treatments.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249508v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.09.21249508";12/01/2021;pharmacogenetics;0.9293
678;A Mathematical Framework for Predicting Lifestyles of Viral Pathogens;10.1007/s11538-020-00730-1;"Despite being similar in structure, functioning, and size, viral pathogens enjoy very different, usually well-defined ways of life. They occupy their hosts for a few days (influenza), for a few weeks (measles), or even lifelong (HCV), which manifests in acute or chronic infections. The various transmission routes (airborne, via direct physical contact, etc.), degrees of infectiousness (referring to the viral load required for transmission), antigenic variation/immune escape and virulence define further aspects of pathogenic lifestyles. To survive, pathogens must infect new hosts; the success determines their fitness. Infection happens with a certain likelihood during contact of hosts, where contact can also be mediated by vectors. Besides structural aspects of the host-contact network, three parameters appear to be key: the contact rate and the infectiousness during contact, which encode the mode of transmission, and third the immunity of susceptible hosts. On these grounds, what can be said about the reproductive success of viral pathogens? This is the biological question addressed in this paper. The answer extends earlier results of the author and makes explicit connection to another basic work on the evolution of pathogens. A mathematical framework is presented that models intra- and inter-host dynamics in a minimalistic but unified fashion covering a broad spectrum of viral pathogens, including those that cause flu-like infections, childhood diseases, and sexually transmitted infections. These pathogens turn out as local maxima of numerically simulated fitness landscapes.

679;Challenges and Opportunities for the Historic Urban Landscape Planning. The Sardinia Region Case Study;10.1007/978-3-030-58820-5_31;The 2011 UNESCO Recommendation defines the Historic Urban Landscape (HUL) as a stratification of historical, cultural and natural values, which broadens the notion of “historic centre” to include the social, environmental and economic components of the urban and geographical context. Italian urban planning has so far adopted a conservative and binding approach to the protection and valorisation of historic settlements. Regulatory planning tools have often failed to combine the protection of physical heritage with the general improvement of urban quality and socio-economic conditions. The limitations of traditional planning can be identified in the difficulty to interpret the urban complexity and in the lack of projects and actions monitoring. The paper investigates the critical issues arising from the application of the traditional planning models for the historic centre, focusing on the case study of the Sardinia Region. The objective of the study is to identify some fields of innovation in the use of planning tools, that take into consideration the characteristics of local contexts and the needs of communities, as recommended by UNESCO. New technologies can contribute to a regularly updated knowledge framework and to the involvement of private actors in regeneration projects. The study shows that the continuous evolution of socio-economic conditions in cities requires open and flexible decision-making based on the principles of sustainability, social inclusion and innovation. The conclusions highlight the need for a review of approaches and tools to give more dynamism and effectiveness to the planning process, including the integration of innovative methods and technologies.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974211/;26/08/2020;Historic Urban Landscape;0.9252
680;Methods to disinfect and decontaminate SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review of in vitro studies;10.1177/2049936121998548;BACKGROUND: Cleaning is a major control component for outbreaks of infection. However, for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there is limited specific guidance regarding the proper disinfection methods that should be used. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature on cleaning, disinfection or decontamination methods in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were included, reporting a variety of methods with which the effectiveness of interventions were assessed. Virus was inoculated onto different types of material including masks, nasopharyngeal swabs, serum, laboratory plates and simulated saliva, tears or nasal fluid and then interventions were applied in an attempt to eliminate the virus including chemical, ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation, and heat and humidity. At body temperature (37°C) there is evidence that the virus will not be detectable after 2 days but this can be reduced to non-detection at 30 min at 56°C, 15 min at 65°C and 2 min at 98°C. Different experimental methods testing UV light have shown that it can inactivate the virus. Light of 254–365 nm has been used, including simulated sunlight. Many chemical agents including bleach, hand sanitiser, hand wash, soap, ethanol, isopropanol, guandinium thiocynate/t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, formaldehyde, povidone-iodine, 0.05% chlorhexidine, 0.1% benzalkonium chloride, acidic electrolysed water, Clyraguard copper iodine complex and hydrogen peroxide vapour have been shown to disinfect SARS-CoV-2.

The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Pharmacy Special Interest Group Steering Committee aims to provide pharmacy practice management recommendations for how to transition clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) or cellular therapy pharmacy services utilizing telemedicine capabilities in the inpatient and outpatient setting to maintain an equivalent level of clinical practice but minimizing viral spread in a high risk, immunocompromised population. Additionally, the Steering Committee offers clinical management recommendations for COVID-19 in HCT and cellular therapy patients based on the rapidly developing literature. As the therapeutic and supportive care interventions for COVID-19 increase, collaboration with clinical pharmacy providers is critical to ensure safe administration in HCT patients. Attention to drug-drug interactions (DDI) and toxicity, particularly QTc prolongation, warrants close cardiac monitoring and potential cessation of concomitant QTc prolonging agents. Expanded indications for hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have already shown potential stress to usual supply chain. Detailed prescribing algorithms, decision pathways and specific patient population stock may be necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged every member of the healthcare team and we must continue to remain vigilant in providing pharmacy clinical services to one of the most high-risk patient populations and remain committed to providing compassionate and safe care for patients receiving HCT and cellular therapies.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879120302147?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305359/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879120302147; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2020.04.005";17/04/2020;coronavirus-19;0.9131
682;Cepheid Xpert(®) Flu/RSV and Seegene Allplex(™) RP1 show high diagnostic agreement for the detection of influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial viruses in clinical practice;10.1111/irv.12799;BACKGROUND: Molecular assays based on reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) provide reliable results for the detection of respiratory pathogens, although diagnostic agreement varies. This study determined the agreement between the RT‐PCR assays (Xpert(®) Flu/RSV vs Allplex(™) RP1) in detecting influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) in clinical practice. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 914 patient encounters where testing with both Xpert(®) Flu/RSV and Allplex(™) RP1 was undertaken between October 2015 and September 2019 in seven hospitals across New South Wales, Australia. The diagnostic agreement of the two assays was evaluated using positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and prevalence and bias‐adjusted kappa. RESULTS: The positive percent agreement was 95.1% for influenza A, 87.5% for influenza B, and 77.8% for RSV. The negative percent agreement was 99.4% for influenza A, 99.9% for influenza B, and 100% for RSV. The prevalence and bias‐adjusted kappa was 0.98 for influenza A, 0.99 for influenza B, and 0.97 for RSV. In a sensitivity analysis, the positive percent agreement values were significantly higher during the non‐influenza season than the influenza season for influenza B and RSV. CONCLUSIONS: The Xpert(®) Flu/RSV and Allplex(™) RP1 demonstrated a high diagnostic agreement for all three viruses assessed. The seasonal variation in the positive percent agreement of the two assays for influenza B and RSV may have been due to lower numbers assessed, variability in the virology of infections outside the peak season, or changes in the physiology of the infected host in different seasons.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815622/";20/08/2020;0.97;0.9548
683;Medication treatment for opioid use disorder in expectant mothers (MOMs): Design considerations for a pragmatic randomized trial comparing extended-release and daily buprenorphine formulations;10.1016/j.cct.2020.106014;"Abstract Opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnant women has increased significantly in recent years. Maintaining these women on sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (BUP) is an evidence-based practice but BUP-SL is associated with several disadvantages that an extended-release (XR) BUP formulation could eliminate. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is conducting an intent-to-treat, two-arm, open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial, Medication treatment for Opioid-dependent expectant Mothers (MOMs), to compare mother and infant outcomes of pregnant women with OUD treated with BUP-XR, relative to BUP-SL. A second aim is to determine the relative economic value of utilizing BUP-XR. Approximately 300 pregnant women with an estimated gestational age (EGA) of 6–30 weeks, recruited from 12 sites, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BUP-XR or BUP-SL, balancing on site, EGA, and BUP-SL status (taking/not taking) at the time of randomization. Participants will be provided with study medication and attend weekly medication visits through 12 months postpartum. Participants will be invited to participate in two sub-studies to evaluate the: 1) mechanisms by which BUP-XR may improve mother and infant outcomes; and 2) effects of prenatal exposure to BUP-XR versus BUP-SL on infant neurodevelopment. This paper describes the key design decisions for the main trial made during protocol development. This Investigational New Drug (IND) trial uniquely uses pragmatic features where feasible in order to maximize external validity, hence increasing the potential to inform clinical practice guidelines and address multiple knowledge gaps for treatment of this patient population.";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551714420300926?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353544/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551714420300926; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2020.106014";27/04/2020;Abstract Opioid use disorder;0.9131
684;EEG-Based Anxious States Classification Using Affective BCI-Based Closed Neurofeedback System;10.1007/s40846-020-00596-7;PURPOSE: Anxiety disorder is one of the psychiatric disorders that involves extreme fear or worry, which can change the balance of chemicals in the brain. To the best of our knowledge, the evaluation of anxiety state is still based on some subjective questionnaires and there is no objective standard assessment yet. Unlike other methods, our approach focuses on study the neural changes to identify and classify the anxiety state using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. METHODS: We designed a closed neurofeedback experiment that contains three experimental stages to adjust subjects’ mental state. The EEG resting state signal was recorded from thirty-four subjects in the first and third stages while EEG-based mindfulness recording was recorded in the second stage. At the end of each stage, the subjects were asked to fill a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). According to their VAS score, the subjects were classified into three groups: non-anxiety, moderate or severe anxiety groups. RESULTS: After processing the EEG data of each group, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were able to classify and identify two mental states (non-anxiety and anxiety) using the Power Spectral Density (PSD) as patterns. The highest classification accuracies using Gaussian kernel function and polynomial kernel function are 92.48 ± 1.20% and 88.60 ± 1.32%, respectively. The highest average of the classification accuracies for healthy subjects is 95.31 ± 1.97% and for anxiety subjects is 87.18 ± 3.51%. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that our proposed EEG neurofeedback-based classification approach is efficient for developing affective BCI system for detection and evaluation of anxiety disorder states.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564280/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40846-020-00596-7";05/02/2021;Power Spectral Density;0.9519
685;Reopening Dental Offices For Routine Care Amid COVID-19 Pandemic: Report from Palestine;10.1016/j.identj.2021.01.017;OBJECTIVES: This study reports on the readiness of Palestinian dentists to re-open their practices for routine care during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study targeted dentists in the West Bank area of Palestine using an on-line survey during the first two weeks of May, 2020. Questions mainly asked about dentists’ perception of the risks of COVID-19, readiness to reopen their clinics for routine care, and the level of confidence in dealing with suspected COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-eight dentists completed the survey. Almost 60% believed that they were not ready to re-open their practices. Almost 13% had “no confidence” in dealing with COVID-19 patients, while 64% had “little to moderate” confidence. Confidence was correlated negatively with increased fear of getting infected (ρ=-0.317, p<0.0001) and positively with years of practice (ρ=1.7, p< 0.0001). Dentists who received updated training on infection control or on COVID-19 reported higher levels of confidence (X(2) =53.8,p<0.0001, X(2)=26.8, p<0.0001 respectively). Although 88% preferred not to treat COVID-19 patients, 40% were willing to provide care to them. Almost 75% reported that they were already facing financial hardships and couldn't survive financially until the end of the current month. CONCLUSIONS: Ethical and financial reasons were the main drivers for dentists in this sample to re-open their practices for routine care. Data from this study highlights the fragility of private dental practice in emergency situations. Ethical, health and financial challenges that emerged during COVID-19 require dentists to adapt and be better prepared to face future crises.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632475/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.identj.2021.01.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020653921000368?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020653921000368";13/02/2021;higher levels of confidence;0.9082

With a vastly expanding amount of publications on COVID-19, clinicians need evidence synthesis to produce guidance for handling patients with COVID-19. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examine which routine laboratory tests are associated with severe COVID-19 disease. CONTENT: PubMed (Medline), Scopus, and Web of Science were searched until the 22(nd) of March 2020 for studies on COVID-19. Eligible studies were original articles reporting on laboratory tests and outcome of patients with COVID-19. Data were synthesised and we conducted random effects meta-analysis and estimated mean difference (MD) and standard mean difference at biomarker level for disease severity. Risk of bias and applicability concern was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies -2. SUMMARY: 45 studies were included, of which 21 publications were used for the meta-analysis. Studies were heterogeneous, but had low risk of bias and applicability concern in terms of patient selection and reference standard. Severe disease was associated with higher white blood cell count (MD 1.28 x 10(9)/L), neutrophil count (MD 1.49 x 10(9)/L), C-reactive protein (MD 49.2 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (MD 196 U/L), D-dimer (SMD 0.58), and aspartate aminotransferase (MD 8.5 U/L), all p < 0.001. Furthermore, low lymphocyte count (MD -0.32 x 10(9)/L), platelet count (MD -22.4 x 10(9)/L), and haemoglobin (MD -4.1 g/L), all p < 0.001, were also associated with severe disease. In conclusion, several routine laboratory tests are associated with disease severity in COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.1093/jalm/jfaa098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32573713/";23/06/2020;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;0.9175
687;Work-life balance predicted work ability two years later: a cohort study of employees in the Swedish energy and water sector;10.1186/s12889-021-11235-4;"BACKGROUND: Work-life balance (WLB) is the extent to which individual’s multiple life roles and demands carry over between each role. WLB can be divided into work interference with personal life (WIPL) and personal life interference with work (PLIW). This study aimed to investigate longitudinal associations between WIPL, PLIW and work ability outcomes. METHODS: In this cohort study, 224 employees in the energy and water sector in Sweden were followed-up over 2 years. Three questions derived from the Work Ability Index were used for measuring work ability outcome: current work ability compared with lifetime best; work ability regarding physical; and mental demands. Logistic regression models were used to analyse longitudinal associations between work ability and WIPL and WIPL respectively, controlling for workplace (company), position at work, experience of leadership quality, demographics, and work ability. RESULTS: Work ability compared to lifetime best were associated with WIPL in the adjusted logistic regression models (odds ratio (OR) 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15–2.73), and PLIW (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.66–6.74). Work ability regarding physical demands was associated with WIPL (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.07–2.40). Work ability regarding mental demands was associated with WIPL (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.03–2.44) and PLIW (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.31–6.32). CONCLUSION: In this two-year longitudinal study, lower WIPL predicted good/excellent overall work ability compared with lifetime best, higher work ability regarding physical and mental demands, and lower PLIW predicted good/excellent overall work ability compared with lifetime best and higher work ability regarding and mental demands.";"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11235-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34167506/";24/06/2021;Work-life balance;0.9273
688;Comparative performance and cycle threshold values of 10 nucleic acid amplification tests for SARS-CoV-2 on clinical samples.;10.1371/journal.pone.0252757;BACKGROUND A number of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for SARS-CoV-2 with different reagents have been approved for clinical use in Japan. These include research kits approved under emergency use authorization through simplified process to stabilize the supply of the reagents. Although these research kits have been increasingly used in clinical practice, limited data is available for the diagnostic performance in clinical settings. METHODS We compared sensitivity, specificity, and cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained by NAATs using 10 kits approved in Japan including eight kits those receiving emergency use authorization using 69 frozen-stored clinical samples including 23 positive samples with various Ct values and 46 negative samples. RESULTS Viral copy number of the frozen-stored samples determined with LightMix E-gene test ranged from 0.6 to 84521.1 copies/μL. While no false-positive results were obtained by any of these tests (specificity: 100% [95% CI, 88.9%-100%]), sensitivity of the nine tests ranged from 68.2% [95% CI, 45.1%-86.1%] to 95.5% [95% CI, 77.2%-99.9%] using LightMix E-gene test as the gold standard. All tests showed positive results for all samples with ≥100 copies/μL. Significant difference of Ct values even among tests amplifying the same genetic region (N1-CDC, N2) was also observed. CONCLUSION Difference in the diagnostic performance was observed among NAATs approved in Japan. Regarding diagnostic kits for emerging infectious diseases, a system is needed to ensure both rapidity of reagent supply and accuracy of diagnosis. Ct values, which are sometimes regarded as a marker of infectivity, are not interchangeable when obtained by different assays.;"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161355/";01/01/2021;nucleic acid amplification tests;0.915
689;Is COVID-19 Related Anxiety Higher in Children With Chronic Kidney Disease Than Healthy Children?;10.1111/ped.14887;BACKGROUND Since the emergence and worldwide spread of the new Coronavirus pandemic(COVID-19), it has caused people to be psychologically adversely affected. This study aimed to assess anxiety levels during COVID-19 in children with chronic kidney disease(CKD), including nephrotic syndrome(NS) and kidney transplantation(Tx). METHODS A case-control, cross-sectional study was conducted with children aged of 10 to 18 years, who had been followed with diagnosis of CKD,NS,Tx between April and July 2020. Healthy control group was recruited age and gender-matched children. A questionnaire with printed and online version is designed in three parts: demographic characteristics, opinions about the pandemic, Turkish version of The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale- Child Version (RCADS-CV). RESULTS Total of 88 children completed the questionnaire. The patient and control groups were similar by gender, age, household members and history of psychiatric treatment. Both groups stated that coronavirus is a risky disease for children(63.6%), they were afraid of contagion(69.3%). Only half of them were receiving realistic and informative answers from family members. In RCADS-CV, 66% of them get high score from at least one subscale. Social Phobia(SP) scores of the control group was higher, although the high-scoring ratios were similar. The ratio of high-scored participants was higher in CKD patients for Panic Disorder, and was lower in immunosuppressive agent group for SP. CONCLUSION The current COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster that children encounter for the first time in their lives. It does not exclusively cause anxiety among children with chronic kidney diseases, but also healthy children.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.14887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131997/";16/06/2021;Coronavirus pandemic;0.9565
690;Awareness And Concerns About Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) Among Parents Of Pediatric Liver Transplant Recipients;10.1111/petr.13805;OBJECTIVES: Pediatric transplant recipients may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to Coronavirus disease (COVID) 19. We undertook a web‐based survey among parents of post‐liver transplant pediatric patients to assess knowledge and concerns regarding COVID‐19 pandemic and impact of social media on them. METHODS: This cross‐sectional online survey was conducted between 21st to 26th March 2020. A 19‐item questionnaire was sent to 172 parents of post‐liver transplant children. RESULTS: 106 (62%) of parents responded. Median time since transplant was 31 (12‐52) months. The majority of parents had good understanding regarding symptomatology and routes of transmission. Only 27% were aware of feco‐oral transmission and 34% knew about gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID‐19. 100 % of parents understood concept of social distancing and 70% knew that asymptomatic individuals can transmit the virus. Television followed by newspapers was the main source of their information, though over 40% claim to regularly receive information through social media. 87% would consult their doctor if the child had a flu‐like symptoms rather than modify immunosuppression or try alternative medications. Parental concerns mainly revolved around early recognition of symptoms, querries on unconventional treatments circulating over social media and supply of medications during the lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS: The Majority of parents had basic understanding of COVID‐19 pandemic. Social media appeared to be an important source of information. Results from this survey helped us in modifying patient care protocols to ensure continuity of care while maintaining social distancing.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663351/; https://doi.org/10.1111/petr.13805";14/07/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9818
691;Impaired Humoral Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and CLL Patients;10.1101/2021.06.02.21257804;"Patients with hematologic malignancies are a high priority for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, yet the benefit they will derive is uncertain. We investigated the humoral response to vaccination in 53 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), or CLL patients. Peripheral blood was obtained 2 weeks after first vaccination and 6 weeks after second vaccination for antibody profiling using the multiplex bead-binding assay. Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody levels to the spike specific receptor binding domain (RBD) were evaluated as a measure of response. Subsequently, antibody-positive serum were assayed for neutralization capacity against authentic SARS-CoV-2. Histology was 68% lymphoma and 32% CLL; groups were: patients receiving anti- CD20-based therapy (45%), monitored with disease (28%), receiving BTK inhibitors (19%), or chemotherapy (all HL) (8%). SARS-CoV-2 specific RBD IgG antibody response was decreased across all NHL and CLL groups: 25%, 73%, and 40%, respectively. Antibody IgG titers were significantly reduced (p < 0.001) for CD20 treated and targeted therapy patients, and (p = 0.003) for monitored patients. In 94% of patients evaluated after first and second vaccination, antibody titers did not significantly boost after second vaccination. Only 13% of CD20 treated and 13% of monitored patients generated neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with ICD50s 135 to 1767, and 445 and > 10240. This data has profound implications given the current guidance relaxing masking restrictions and for timing of vaccinations.

692;Suspension microarray-based comparison of oropharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for pathogen identification in young children hospitalized with respiratory tract infection;10.1186/s12879-020-4900-8;BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infection (RTI) in young children is a leading cause of morbidity and hospitalization worldwide. There are few studies assessing the performance for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) versus oropharyngeal swab (OPS) specimens in microbiological findings for children with RTI. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the detection rates of OPS and paired BALF in detecting key respiratory pathogens using suspension microarray. METHODS: We collected paired OPS and BALF specimens from 76 hospitalized children with respiratory illness. The samples were tested simultaneously for 8 respiratory viruses and 5 bacteria by suspension microarray. RESULTS: Of 76 paired specimens, 62 patients (81.6%) had at least one pathogen. BALF and OPS identified respiratory pathogen infections in 57 (75%) and 49 (64.5%) patients, respectively (P > 0.05). The etiology analysis revealed that viruses were responsible for 53.7% of the patients, whereas bacteria accounted for 32.9% and Mycoplasma pneumoniae for 13.4%. The leading 5 pathogens identified were respiratory syncytial virus, Streptococcus pneumoniaee, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and adenovirus, and they accounted for 74.2% of etiological fraction. For detection of any pathogen, the overall detection rate of BALF (81%) was marginally higher than that (69%) of OPS (p = 0.046). The differences in the frequency distribution and sensitivity for most pathogens detected by two sampling methods were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, BALF and OPS had similar microbiological yields.

693;Polypharmacy, functional outcome, and treatment effect of intravenous alteplase for acute ischemic stroke.;10.1111/ene.14566;"BACKGROUND Polypharmacy is an important challenge in clinical practice. We aimed at determining the effect of polypharmacy on functional outcome and treatment effect of alteplase in acute ischemic stroke. METHODS Post-hoc analysis of the randomized, placebo-controlled WAKE-UP trial of MRI-guided intravenous alteplase in unknown onset stroke. Polypharmacy was defined as intake of ≥5 medications at baseline. Comorbidities were assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The primary efficacy variable was favorable outcome defined by a score of 0-1 on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. We used logistic regression analysis to test for an association of polypharmacy with functional outcome, and for interaction of polypharmacy and the effect of thrombolysis. RESULTS Polypharmacy was present in 133/503 (26%) patients. Patients with polypharmacy were older (mean age 70 vs 64 years; P<0.0001) and had a higher score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at baseline (median 7 vs 5; P=0.0007). A comorbidity load defined by a CCI score ≥2 was more frequent in patients with polypharmacy (48% vs 8%; P<0.001). Polypharmacy was associated with lower odds of favorable outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0.50, 95% CI, 0.30-0.85; P=0.0099), while the CCI score was not. Treatment with alteplase was associated with higher odds of favorable outcome in both groups, with no heterogeneity of treatment effect (test for interaction of treatment and polypharmacy, P=0.29). CONCLUSION In stroke patients, polypharmacy is associated with worse functional outcome after intravenous thrombolysis independent of comorbidities. However, polypharmacy does not interact with the beneficial effect of alteplase.";"https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015924/";05/10/2020;Polypharmacy;0.9049
694;Anxiety and depression in allergic rhinitis patients during COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China.;10.12932/ap-140820-0941;BACKGROUND During COVID-19 pandemic, many allergic rhinitis (AR) patients stopped their treatment including pharmacotherapy and allergen immunotherapy. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the anxiety and depression and general effect of COVID-19 pandemic on AR patients' psychological status in Wuhan, China. METHODS In October 2019, 222 outpatients suffering from AR in our department and 133 healthy controls were enrolled. All participants were asked to finish the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire. The demographic characteristics and the severity of AR symptoms were recorded. In April 2020, the AR patients and healthy controls were re-contacted to finish the questionnaires by telephone or online. The SAS and SDS scores in AR patients and healthy controls and the correlation with other variables were analyzed. RESULTS For AR patients, the SAS and SDS scores were significantly higher than healthy controls. Meanwhile, the rates of anxiety and depression were 24.8% and 19.4% respectively. The education level and symptoms severity were correlated with SAS and SDS scores. Ninety-eight AR patients and 56 healthy controls finished the questionnaires after COVID-19 pandemic. The AR patients' SAS and SDS scores were lower than before COVID-19 pandemic and were correlated with AR symptom scores. The scores of healthy controls were not different with before COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of anxiety and depression is common in AR patients. Severity of symptoms and low education level are the risk factors causing anxiety and depression.

695;Decline in Emergent and Urgent Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic;10.1101/2020.05.14.20096602;"Due to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there are concerns that patients may be avoiding care for emergent and urgent health conditions due to fear of contagion or as an unintentional consequence of government orders to postpone non-essential services. We therefore sought to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of patient encounters for select emergent or urgent diagnoses at a large tertiary-care academic medical center in Boston. Inpatient diagnoses included acute myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, and outpatient but urgent diagnoses included new referrals for breast and hematologic malignancies. For each condition, we used a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the proportional change in number of encounters during the pandemic (March-April 2020) compared with earlier in the same year (January-February 2020), using equivalent periods in 2019 as a control. After the onset of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in hospitalizations for MI (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.46-0.96; P=0.04) and stroke (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.42; 95%CI, 0.28-0.65; P<0.001) (Table). In the ambulatory setting, there was a reduction in referrals for breast cancer and hematologic cancers, but this did not reach statistical significance until the month after the onset of the pandemic.

696;Analysis of the potential impact of genomic variants in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India on molecular diagnostic assays;10.1101/2020.08.05.238618;An isolated epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19) originating in Wuhan, China has now rapidly emerged into a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of disease. The virus has been evolving through base substitutions. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different countries including India motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of variations in target sites for the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis. We catalogued a total of 132 primers or probes sequences from the literature and the public domain. Our analysis revealed a total of 125 unique genetic variants in 80 either primers or probes binding sites. A total of 13 unique variants had allele frequency of [â¥] 1% in Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes mapped to the primers or probes binding sites. A total of 15 primers or probes binding sites had cumulative variant frequency of [â¥] 1% in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These included primers or probes sites which are widely used in India and across the world for molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. This highlights the need for sequencing genomes of emerging pathogens to make evidence based policies for development and approval of diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the most comprehensive analysis of genomic variants in genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India and their potential impact on efficacy of molecular diagnostics.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.05.238618;05/08/2020;Coronavirus Diseases;0.9813
697;Real-Time Tracking of COVID-19 Rumors Using Community-Based Methods in Côte d'Ivoire.;10.9745/ghsp-d-21-00031;Global misinformation and information overload have characterized the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Rumors are unverified pieces of information spreading online or person-to-person that reduce trust in health authorities and create barriers to protective practices. Risk communication and community engagement can increase transparency, build trust, and stop the spread of rumors. Building on previous work on Ebola and Zika viruses using Global Health Security Agenda systems strengthening support, the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Breakthrough ACTION project developed a process and technology for systematically collecting, analyzing, and addressing COVID-19 rumors in real-time in Côte d'Ivoire. Rumors were submitted through community-based contributors and collected from callers to the national hotlines and then processed on a cloud-hosted database built on the open-source software District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2). Hotline teleoperators and data managers coded rumors in near-real-time according to behavioral theory frameworks within DHIS2 and visualized the findings on custom dashboards. The analysis and response were done in full collaboration with the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and implementing partners to ensure a timely and coordinated response. The system captured both widespread rumors consistent with misinformation in other settings, such as suspicions about case counts and the belief that masks were deliberately contaminated, as well as very localized beliefs related to specific influencers. The qualitative findings provided rapid insights on circulating beliefs, enabling risk communicators to nuance and tailor messaging around COVID-19.;"https://doi.org/10.9745/ghsp-d-21-00031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038385/";25/05/2021;coronavirus disease;0.974
698;The mobility gap: estimating mobility levels required to control Canada's winter COVID-19 surge;10.1101/2021.01.28.21250622;Background Non-pharmaceutical interventions remain a primary means of suppressing COVID-19 until vaccination coverage is sufficient to achieve herd immunity. We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures in seven Canadian provinces to quantify the mobility level needed to suppress COVID-19 (mobility threshold), and the difference relative to current mobility levels (mobility gap). Methods We conducted a longitudinal study of weekly COVID-19 incidence from March 15, 2020 to January 16, 2021, among provinces with 20 COVID-19 cases in at least 10 weeks. The outcome was weekly growth rate defined as the ratio of current cases compared to the previous week. We examined the effects of average time spent outside the home (non-residential mobility) in the prior three weeks using a lognormal regression model accounting for province, season, and mean temperature. We calculated the COVID-19 mobility threshold and gap. Results Across the 44-week study period, a total of 704,294 persons were infected with COVID-19. Non-residential mobility dropped rapidly in the spring and reached a median of 36% (IQR: 31,40) in April 2020. After adjustment, each 5% increase in non-residential mobility was associated with a 9% increase in the COVID-19 weekly growth rate (ratio=1.09, 95%CI: 1.07,1.12). The mobility gap increased through the fall months, which was associated with increasing case growth. Interpretation Mobility strongly and consistently predicts weekly case growth, and low levels of mobility are needed to control COVID-19 through winter 2021. Mobility measures from anonymized smartphone data can be used to guide the provincial and regional implementation and loosening of physical distancing measures.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.28.21250622v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.28.21250622";01/02/2021;mobility threshold;0.9885
699;Three-month outcomes from a patient-centered program to treat opioid use disorder in Iowa, USA;10.1186/s13011-021-00342-5;BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder (OUD), a chronic disease, is a major public health problem. Despite availability of effective treatment, too few people receive it and treatment retention is low. Understanding barriers and facilitators of treatment access and retention is needed to improve outcomes for people with OUD. OBJECTIVES: To assess 3-month outcomes pilot data from a patient-centered OUD treatment program in Iowa, USA, that utilized flexible treatment requirements and prioritized engagement over compliance. METHODS: Forty patients (62.5% female: mean age was 35.7 years, SD 9.5) receiving medication, either buprenorphine or naltrexone, to treat OUD were enrolled in an observational study. Patients could select or decline case management, counseling, and peer recovery groups. Substance use, risk and protective factors, and recovery capital were measured at intake and 3 months. RESULTS: Most participants reported increased recovery capital. The median Assessment of Recovery Capital (ARC) score went from 37 at enrollment to 43 (p < 0.01). Illegal drug use decreased, with the median days using illegal drugs in the past month dropping from 10 to 0 (p < 0.001). Cravings improved: 29.2% reported no cravings at intake and 58.3% reported no cravings at 3 months (p < 0.001). Retention rate was 92.5% at 3 months. Retention rate for participants who were not on probation/parole was higher (96.9%) than for those on probation/parole (62.5%, p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: This study shows preliminary evidence that a care model based on easy and flexible access and strategies to improve treatment retention improves recovery capital, reduces illegal drug use and cravings, and retains people in treatment.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33435993/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13011-021-00342-5";12/01/2021;Opioid use disorder;0.9653
700;Chronic disorders of consciousness: a case report with longitudinal evaluation of disease progression using 7 T magnetic resonance imaging;10.1186/s12883-020-01973-0;BACKGROUND: Outcome prediction for patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) is essential yet challenging. Evidence showed that patients with DOC lasting 1 year or longer after a brain injury were less likely to recover. However, the reasons why outcomes of DOC patients differ greatly remain unclear. With a variety of analytical methods and through quantitative behavioral assessments, we aimed to track the progression of a patient with severe brain injury, in order to advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of DOC. CASE PRESENTATION: We performed a longitudinal study for a 52-year-old male DOC patient who has remained in the state for 1.5 years with comprehensive rehabilitative therapies. The patient underwent 3 times of assessments of Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and ultra-high-field 7 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both topologic properties and brain microstructure were analyzed to track disease progression. We observed dynamic increases of fiber densities with measurements at three time points (t1:1.5 M, t2:7.5 M t3:17.5 M). Specifically, fiber densities of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and arcuate fasciculus nerve fiber bundles improved mostly in the visual, verbal, and auditory subscales, which was consistent with the CRS-R scores. Moreover, the graph-theory analyses demonstrated that network topologic properties showed an improvement although the disease duration exceeded 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: DOC patients with a course longer than 1 year remain possible to improve, and including evaluation methods such as WM connectome analysis and graph theory could be potentially valuable for a more precise assessment of patients with a longer course of DOC.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594973/;29/10/2020;Outcome prediction for patients with disorders of consciousness;0.9235
701;Trend of nutrition research in endocrine disorders, gaps, and future plans: a collection of experiences of an endocrinology research institute;10.1007/s40200-020-00707-w;BACKGROUND: Nutrition plays a pivotal role in the prevention and treatment of endocrine disorders. The aim of this study was to provide a window in order to display the 25-year activities of Endocrinology & Metabolism Research Institute (EMRI), and the gaps and future plans in the field of nutrition and endocrine disorders. METHODS: To collect papers affiliated to the EMRI in field of nutrition from the inception to December 1st 2019, the electronic databases including PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched. Publications in English and Persian languages were included. Scientific Landscapes (VOS viewer) software version 1.6.13 was used to provide bibliometric maps. RESULTS: Of 4082 studies identified in the initial search, 319 relevant papers were included. They contributed systematic review and meta-analysis/review (n = 76), clinical trials (n = 58), cross-sectional (n = 171), case-control studies (n = 11), and animal studies (n = 3). Accordingly, most nutrition studies were dedicated to the level of evidence III (cross-sectional studies: 53.60%) followed by systematic review studies (23.82%) with the level of evidence I. There was also an increasing trend in the nutrition studies through years, with a peak in 2019. CONCLUSION: An increasing trend in the publications related to nutrition science is observed at EMRI. However, nutrition research and publications can grow further through expanding collaborations with other fields related to endocrine. Given nutritional assessments in national projects and focusing on the identification of preventive nutritional strategies, considering the situations of our society can be helpful to make nutritional findings more practical.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500881/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40200-020-00707-w";22/01/2021;Nutrition;0.9585
702;Meteorological factors and domestic new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities: A time-series analysis;10.1101/2020.04.15.20066613;AIM To investigate the associations of meteorological factors and the daily new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities. METHOD Pearson correlation and generalized additive modeling were performed to assess the relationships between daily new COVID-19 cases and meteorological factors (daily average temperature and relative humidity) with the most updated data currently available. RESULTS The Pearson correlation showed that daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were more correlated with the average temperature than with relative humidity. Daily new confirmed cases were negatively correlated with the average temperature in Beijing (r=-0.565, P<0.01), Shanghai (r=-0.471, P<0.01), and Guangzhou (r=-0.530, P<0.01) , yet in contrast, positively correlated with that in Japan (r=0.441, P<0.01). In most of the cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur), generalized additive modeling analysis showed the number of daily new confirmed cases was positively associated with both average temperature and relative humidity, especially in lagged 3d model, where a positive influence of temperature on the daily new confirmed cases was discerned in 5 cities except in Beijing, Wuhan, Korea, and Malaysia. Nevertheless, the results were inconsistent across cities and lagged time, suggesting meteorological factors were unlikely to greatly influence the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION The associations between meteorological factors and the number of COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent across cities and lagged time. Large-scale public health measures and expanded regional research are still required until a vaccine becomes available and herd immunity is established.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20066613;18/04/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9896
703;Decreased Tongue Strength is Related to Skeletal Muscle Mass in COPD Patients;10.1007/s00455-021-10314-3;"Dysphagia is frequently observed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Decreased tongue strength is one of the causes of dysphagia, and it is often observed in patients with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is also frequently observed in COPD patients. We hypothesized that tongue strength is lower in COPD patients compared to normal subjects. This was a single-center, observational, cross-sectional study. Maximum tongue pressure (MTP) was measured in 27 patients with COPD and 24 age-matched control subjects. We also evaluated handgrip strength, gait speed, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass to define subjects as having sarcopenia. We used bioelectrical impedance analysis to assess body composition. The eating assessment test-10 was used to diagnose dysphagia. MTP was significantly lower in COPD patients than in control subjects (33.8 ± 8.4 vs 38.0 ± 5.3; p = 0.032). All measures of muscle and fat free body mass, handgrip strength, and gait speed were also significantly lower in COPD patients compared to control subjects (p < 0.01). The prevalence of sarcopenia in COPD patients was higher than that in control subjects (6/27 versus 0/24; p = 0.007), but the prevalence of dysphagia was not different between groups (COPD: 5/27, versus control: 1/24; p = 0.112). MTP was moderately correlated with skeletal muscle mass index (r = 0.56, p = 0.003) and handgrip strength (r = 0.43, p = 0.027) in COPD patients. Tongue strength was lower in COPD patients compared to normal subjects, and decreased tongue strength may be correlated with sarcopenia in COPD patients.

704;Design and methodology of the chronic kidney disease as a dysmetabolic determinant of disability among older people (CKD-3D) study: a multicenter cohort observational study;10.1007/s40520-020-01755-1;BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition in older people and represents a global health issue since it increases the risk of associated comorbidities and all-cause mortality. Furthermore, older people with reduced renal function might be at higher risk for developing functional limitation and disability. Moreover, the current creatinine-based measures of renal function are influenced by several factors in older population. The aims of the CKD-3D project are to perform an observational study to expand the knowledge about CKD-disability relationship and to investigate the use of novel biomarkers of kidney function. METHODS: An observational, multicenter, prospective cohort study will be conducted in 75 + old patients consecutively admitted to acute care wards of geriatric medicine at participating hospitals. The study planned to enroll 440 patients undergoing clinical and laboratory evaluations at baseline and after 12 months. Face-to-face follow-up at 6 months and telephone follow-up at 3 and 9 months will be carried out. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) and the measurement of Cystatin C, Beta-Trace Protein and Beta2-Microglobulin levels will be included. DISCUSSION: This study will provide useful information to prevent CKD-related disability by collecting real-life data over 1-year period. The combined approach of CGA and the investigation of innovative existing biomarkers will make it possible to develop new recommendations and guidelines for a patient-centered approach. It is believed that such a study may lead to an improvement of knowledge on CKD in elderly patients and may also have implications in daily clinical practice and in decision-making process.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389685/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-020-01755-1";03/01/2021;Chronic kidney disease;0.9395
705;Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing in Oesophagogastric Surgery: a Systematic Review.;10.1007/s11605-020-04696-2;"BACKGROUND Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) can objectively measure fitness and oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold. The relationship between fitness and postoperative outcomes after upper gastro-intestinal surgery is unclear. The aim of the present review is to assess the prognostic ability of CPX in predicting postoperative outcome associated with oesophagogastric surgery. METHODS Relevant studies were identified through a systematic search of EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to July 2019. The eligibility criteria for studies included prognostic studies of upper gastro-intestinal surgery among adult populations using a preoperative CPX and measurement of postoperative outcome (mortality or morbidity or length of stay). Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS Quality in Prognostic Studies validated tool. RESULTS Thirteen papers with a total of 1735 participants were included in data extraction. A total of 7 studies examined the association between CPX variables and postoperative mortality. Patients undergoing gastro-intestinal surgery with lower anaerobic threshold values were found to have an increased risk of postoperative mortality. Similarly, a lower rate of oxygen consumption was found to be associated with higher mortality. There was conflicting evidence regarding the association between CPX variables and postoperative morbidity. The evidence did not demonstrate any association between preoperative CPX variables and hospital length of stay. CONCLUSION Studies report an association between CPX variables and postoperative mortality; however, there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between CPX variables and postoperative morbidity.";"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-020-04696-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32632727/";06/07/2020;Cardiopulmonary exercise testing;0.9106
706;Characteristics, symptom management and outcomes of 101 patients with COVID-19 referred for hospital palliative care;10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.015;"Hospital palliative care is an essential part of the COVID-19 response but data are lacking. We identified symptom burden, management, response to treatment, and outcomes for a case series of 101 in-patients with confirmed COVID-19 referred to hospital palliative care. Patients (64 male, median [IQR] age 82 [72-89] years, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 6 [2-10], Australian-modified Karnofsky Performance Status 20 [10-20]), were most frequently referred for end of life care or symptom control. Median [IQR] days from hospital admission to referral was 4 [1-12] days. Most prevalent symptoms (n) were breathlessness (67), agitation (43), drowsiness (36), pain (23) and delirium (24). Fifty-eight patients were prescribed a subcutaneous infusion. Frequently used medicines (median-maximum dose/24h) were opioids (morphine, 10-30mg; fentanyl, 100-200mcg; alfentanil 500-1000 mcg) and midazolam (10-20mg). Infusions were assessed as at least partially effective for 40/58 patients, while 13 patients died before review. Patients spent a median [IQR] of 2 [1–4] days under the palliative care team, who made 3 [2–5] contacts across patient, family and clinicians. At March 30 2020, 75 patients had died, 13 been discharged back to team, home or hospice, and 13 continued to receive inpatient palliative care. Palliative care is an essential component to the COVID-19 response, and teams must rapidly adapt with new ways of working. Breathlessness and agitation are common but respond well to opioids and benzodiazepines. Availability of subcutaneous infusion pumps is essential.

707;Findings of remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter defibrillators during the COVID‐19 pandemic;10.1111/pace.14086;BACKGROUND: Monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices was highly impacted by the COVID‐19 pandemic considering the high volume of in‐person visits for regular follow‐up. Recent recommendations highlight the important role of remote monitoring to prevent exposure to the virus. This study compared remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in patients whose in‐person annual visit was substituted for a remote monitoring session with patients who were already scheduled for a remote monitoring session. METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional observational study of 329 consecutive patients between 20 March and 24 April 2020. Group 1 included 131 patients whose in‐person annual visit was substituted for a remote monitoring session. Group 2 included 198 patients who underwent a remote monitoring session as scheduled in their usual device follow‐up. The time interval since the last in‐person visit was 13.3 ± 3.2 months in group 1 and 5.9 ± 1.7 months in group 2 (P < .01). RESULTS: In group 1, 15 patients (11.5%) experienced a clinical event compared to 15 patients (7.6%) in group 2 (P = .25). Nineteen patients (14.5%) required a physician intervention in group 1 compared to 19 patients (9.6%) in group 2 (P = .22). Two patients (1.5%) in group 1 and four patients (2.0%) in group 2 required an early in‐person follow‐up visit during the pandemic (P > .99). CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring of ICDs is useful to identify clinical events and allows physicians to treat patients appropriately during the COVID‐19 pandemic regardless of the time interval since their last in‐person visit. It reduces significantly in‐person visit for regular follow‐up.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/pace.14086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021739/";26/10/2020;Monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices;0.9778
708;Risk factors for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in patients with common cold symptoms in a primary care setting – a retrospective analysis based on a joint documentation standard;10.1186/s12875-020-01322-7;"BACKGROUND: Combating the COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for health systems, citizens and policy makers worldwide. Early detection of affected patients within the large and heterogeneous group of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort, but often hindered by limited testing resources, false-negative test results and the lack of pathognomonic symptoms in COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to identify anamnestic items with an increased/decreased odds ratio for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (CovPCR) result in a primary care setting. METHODS: We performed a multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive clinical characteristics for a positive CovPCR over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. RESULTS: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received CovPCR and were included in this analysis. The median age was 44.0 (IQR: 31.0–59.0) and a fraction of 10.7% (n = 40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51–13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11–0.97). Furthermore, patients who had a first grade contact with an infected persons and showed symptoms themselves also had an increased OR for positive testing (OR: 5.16; 95% CI: 1.72–15.51). This correlation was also present when they themselves were still asymptomatic (OR: 12.55; 95% CI: 3.97–39.67). CONCLUSIONS: Several anamnestic criteria may be helpful to assess pre-test probability of COVID-19 in patients with common cold symptoms.

709;The Effect of Quarantine Due to COVID-19 Pandemic in Surgically Treated Fractures in Greece: a Two-Center Study.;10.26574/maedica.2020.15.3.332;"Objectives: Many countries have implemented quarantines to control the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spread. The quarantine effects on surgically-treated fractures, operated during this period (March 9th - May 4th) in two public Greek institutions, the ""Venizeleion"" General Hospital of Crete (VGH) and the ""251"" Hellenic Air Force General Hospital of Athens (""251"" HAFGH) were evaluated and compared with those of the same period of 2019. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective study of a prospectively collected database. Evaluated data included gender, age, and trauma mechanism. Outcomes: A total of 103 patients who had suffered fractures were surgically treated in both institutions during the quarantine period of 2020 compared to 179 during the same period of 2019, showing a reduction of 43% in surgical cases. The mean age of patients treated in 2020 was 72.2 (SD=19.9), as compared to 65.3 (SD=21.5; p-value=0.008) in 2019. There were 70 (68%) elderly patients (>65 years) in 2020 and 103 (57.6%) in 2019. Of all treated fractures, 31% were caused by high energy mechanisms during the explored period of 2020, as compared to 45% in 2019 (p-value=0.019). Conclusions: This is the first study in Europe evaluating the effect of COVID-19 quarantine on surgically treated fractures. The findings showed a significant decline in surgically treated fractures, particularly high-energy fractures, along with a significantly higher mean age of patients in 2020 compared to 2019.

Thus, the objective of the study was to review the literature and critically discuss important concerns about the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because dental professionals are in close contact with the main viral transmission routes, this study presents recommendations for management and protection during clinical dental care. The main characteristics and transmission routes of COVID-19 are also discussed. Dental professionals should control pain and the side effects of antineoplastic treatment and use preventive measures for infection control. During this pandemic, patients with head and neck cancer should not undergo elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or a history of COVID-19; therefore, in asymptomatic or painless cases, only preventive actions are recommended. In symptomatic or painful cases, precautions for safe interventional treatments must be implemented by following the hygiene measures recommended by health agencies and using personal protective equipment.

They have been implemented globally during the pandemic, however, the specific NPIs implemented and the timing of interventions has varied widely. We validated two published datasets on the implementation of NPIs globally. The health and socioeconomic factors associated with delay in implementation of NPIs was analyzed using fractional logit and probit models, and beta regression models. The probability of timely NPI implementation by a country was analyzed using a probit model. The effects of these interventions on mobility changes using Google social mobility reports, were analyzed with propensity score matching methods. Three NPIs were analyzed: national school closure, national lockdown, and global travel ban. Countries with higher incomes, larger populations, and better health preparedness measures had greater delays in implementation. Countries with greater population density, more democratic political systems, lower case detection capacity, and later arrival of first cases were more likely to implement NPIs. Implementation of lockdowns significantly reduced physical mobility. Mobility was further reduced when lockdowns were enforced with curfews or fines, or were more strictly defined. National school closures did not significantly change mobility. The implementation of NPIs is a global public good during pandemics, and the international community needs to address constraints and design incentives so countries implement NPIs in a timely manner. Further analysis is needed on the effect of NPI variations on mobility and transmission, and their associated costs.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.09.20096420v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096420";13/05/2020;Non-pharmaceutical interventions;0.9321
712;Femoral arterial thrombosis in a young adult following non-severe COVID-19;10.1016/j.avsg.2020.07.013;INTRODUCTION: Few cases of arterial thromboembolisms have been reported after 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in case of severe infection or elderly patients. We report a case of femoral arterial thrombosis in a young patient following non-severe infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A common femoral artery thrombosis extended in the first third of superficial and profunda femoral arteries associated with tibial posterior and popliteal arteries thrombosis were diagnosed in a 24 year-old man complaining of right lower limb pain for one month. The evolution was good after anticoagulation and antiaggregant treatments and thrombectomy. Etiologic assessment was negative except non-severe COVID-19. DISCUSSION: 2019 coronavirus accesses host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein, abundant in the lung, also expressed by endothelial cells and COVID-19 is associated with important inflammatory syndrome and coagulopathy, leading to vascular lesions. Thrombosis prevalence is not fully established, seems to be higher in case of major inflammation and in intensive care unit (ICU). Arterial thromboembolisms are described in many vascular territories, each time in elderly patients or severe infection. We described a femoral arterial thrombosis in a young patient with negative etiological assessment except non-severe COVID-19. Treatment consists in anticoagulation and antiaggregant drugs and thrombectomy. Preventing venous thromboembolism treatment is recommended in case of severe infection or in ICU but there is no clear recommendation for arterial thromboembolism prevention. This case should lead us to be very careful to arterial event risk even if the infection is non-severe and the patient young.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S089050962030604X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736027/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089050962030604X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2020.07.013";28/07/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9052
713;Dietary Flavonoids: Cardioprotective Potential with Antioxidant Effects and Their Pharmacokinetic, Toxicological and Therapeutic Concerns.;10.3390/molecules26134021;Flavonoids comprise a large group of structurally diverse polyphenolic compounds of plant origin and are abundantly found in human diet such as fruits, vegetables, grains, tea, dairy products, red wine, etc. Major classes of flavonoids include flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavanols, anthocyanidins, isoflavones, and chalcones. Owing to their potential health benefits and medicinal significance, flavonoids are now considered as an indispensable component in a variety of medicinal, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic preparations. Moreover, flavonoids play a significant role in preventing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which could be mainly due to their antioxidant, antiatherogenic, and antithrombotic effects. Epidemiological and in vitro/in vivo evidence of antioxidant effects supports the cardioprotective function of dietary flavonoids. Further, the inhibition of LDL oxidation and platelet aggregation following regular consumption of food containing flavonoids and moderate consumption of red wine might protect against atherosclerosis and thrombosis. One study suggests that daily intake of 100 mg of flavonoids through the diet may reduce the risk of developing morbidity and mortality due to coronary heart disease (CHD) by approximately 10%. This review summarizes dietary flavonoids with their sources and potential health implications in CVDs including various redox-active cardioprotective (molecular) mechanisms with antioxidant effects. Pharmacokinetic (oral bioavailability, drug metabolism), toxicological, and therapeutic aspects of dietary flavonoids are also addressed herein with future directions for the discovery and development of useful drug candidates/therapeutic molecules.;"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26134021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209338/";30/06/2021;coronary heart disease;0.9521
714;Benefits and adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and colchicine: searching for repurposable drug candidates;10.1007/s00296-020-04694-2;Repurposing of antirheumatic drugs has garnered global attention. The aim of this article is to overview available evidence on the use of widely used antirheumatic drugs hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and colchicine for additional indications. Hydroxychloroquine has endothelial stabilizing and anti-thrombotic effects. Its use has been explored as an adjunctive therapy in refractory thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome. It may also prevent recurrent pregnancy losses in the absence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Hydroxychloroquine favourably modulates atherogenic lipid and glycaemic profiles. Methotrexate has been tried for modulation of cardiovascular events in non-rheumatic clinical conditions, although a large clinical trial failed to demonstrate a benefit. Colchicine has been shown to successfully reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in a large multicentric trial. Potential antifibrotic effects of colchicine require further exploration. Hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and colchicine are also being tried at different stages of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic for prophylaxis and treatment. While the use of these agents is being diversified, their adverse effects should be timely diagnosed and prevented. Hydroxychloroquine can cause retinopathy and rarely cardiac and auditory toxicity, retinopathy being dose and time dependent. Methotrexate can cause transaminitis, cytopenias and renal failure, particularly in acute overdoses. Colchicine can rarely cause myopathies, cardiomyopathy, cytopenias and transaminitis. Strong evidence is warranted to keep balance between benefits of repurposing these old antirheumatic drugs and risk of their adverse effects.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-020-04694-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32880032/";02/09/2020;Coronavirus Disease 19;0.9827
715;Sentiment analysis of user feedback on the HSE’s Covid-19 contact tracing app;10.1007/s11845-021-02529-y;BACKGROUND: Digital Contact Tracing is seen as a key tool in reducing the propagation of Covid-19. But it requires high uptake and continued participation across the population to be effective. To achieve sufficient uptake/participation, health authorities should address, and thus be aware of, user concerns. AIM: This work manually analyzes user reviews of the Irish Heath Service Executive’s (HSE) Contact Tracker app, to identify user concerns and to lay the foundations for subsequent, large-scale, automated analyses of reviews. While this might seem tightly scoped to the Irish context, the HSE app provides the basis for apps in many jurisdictions in the USA and Europe. METHODS: Manual analysis of (1287) user reviews from the Google/Apple playstores was performed, to identify the aspects of the app that users focused on, and the positive/negative sentiment expressed. RESULTS: The findings suggest a largely positive sentiment towards the app, and that users thought it handled data protection and transparency aspects well. But feedback suggests that users would appreciate more targeted feedback on the incidence of the virus, and facilities for more proactive engagement, like notifications that prompt users to submit their health status daily. Finally, the analysis suggests that the “android battery” issue and the backward-compatibility issue with iPhones seriously impacted retention/uptake of the app respectively. CONCLUSION: The HSE have responded to the public’s desire for targeted feedback in newer versions, but should consider increasing the app’s proactive engagement. The results suggest they should also raise the backward compatibility issue, regarding older iPhones, with Apple.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02529-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33604836/";18/02/2021;Digital Contact Tracing;0.968
716;Risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a systematic review and meta-analysis of retrospective studies;10.1101/2020.04.09.20056291;Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease that was first reported in Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China, and has subsequently spread worldwide. Risk factors for mortality have not been well summarized. Current meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between age, gender, comorbidities and risk of death from COVID-19 infection. Methods: Online databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Google scholar were searched to detect relevant publications up to 22 March 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, random-effects model was used. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were also done. Results: In total, six retrospective studies with 22,350 COVID-19 infected patients and 741 cases of death were included in the current meta-analysis. A significant positive association was found between older age (≥65 years old) and COVID-19 mortality (combined effect size=2.39 (over twofold), 95% CIs=1.75-3.28, p<0.001). Such finding was also seen for hypertension (combined effect size=3.29 (over threefold), 95% CIs=1.54-7.05, p=0.002), diabetes (combined effect size=3.11 (over threefold), 95% CIs=1.10-8.80, p=0.032), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (combined effect size=7.69 (over sevenfold), 95% CIs=5.65-10.47, p<0.001) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (combined effect size=7.39 (over sevenfold), 95% CIs=2.88-18.96, p<0.001). Conclusions: Older age, hypertension, diabetes, COPD and CVDs were associated with greater risk of death from COVID-19 infection. These findings could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20056291;11/04/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.925
717;The Association of Advance Care Planning Documentation and End-of-Life Healthcare Use Among Patients With Multimorbidity.;10.1177/1049909120968527;PURPOSE Multimorbidity is associated with increased intensity of end-of-life healthcare. This association has been examined by number but not type of conditions. Our purpose was to understand how intensity of care is influenced by multimorbidity within specific chronic conditions to provide guidance for interventions to improve end-of-life care for these patients. METHODS We identified adults cared for in a multihospital healthcare system who died between 2010-2017. We categorized patients by 4 primary chronic conditions: heart failure, pulmonary disease, renal disease, or dementia. Within each condition, we examined the effect of multimorbidity (presence of 4 or more chronic conditions) on hospital and ICU admission in the last 30 days of life, in-hospital death, and advance care planning (ACP) documentation >30 days before death. We performed logistic regression to estimate associations between multimorbidity and end-of-life care utilization, stratified by the presence or absence of ACP documentation. RESULTS ACP documentation >30 days before death was associated with lower odds of in-hospital death for all 4 conditions both in patients with and without multimorbidity. With the exception of patients with renal disease without multimorbidity, we observed lower odds of hospitalization and ICU admission for all patients with ACP >30 days before death. CONCLUSIONS Patients with dementia and multimorbidity had the highest odds of high-intensity end-of-life care. For patients with dementia, heart failure, or pulmonary disease, ACP documentation >30 days before death was associated with lower likelihood of in-hospital death, hospitalization, and ICU use at end-of-life, regardless of multimorbidity.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120968527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084357/";21/10/2020;multimorbidity;0.9345
718;Prevention measures and risk factors for COVID-19 in Iranian workplaces.;10.3233/wor-205045;BACKGROUND Exposure to the coronavirus (COVID-19) in industrial workplaces has caused concerns all over the world. Implementation of prevention measures is the best solution for protection of workers' health. OBJECTIVE The present study investigated prevention measures and risk factors for the COVID-19 infection in Iranian small, medium, and large industries. METHODS This study was conducted on 349 occupational health, safety, and environment professionals working in different industries. Data was collected using a checklist of prevention measures for COVID-19 and a questionnaire of risk factors for the infection. RESULTS The results demonstrated that 32.60%of industries reported positive cases of COVID-19. The mean of prevention measures in all the dimensions, except use of personal protective equipment (PPE), was in favorable status. Among prevention measures against COVID-19, the dimensions of education, engineering controls, use of PPE, use of hand washing soap and disinfectant, and physical distance were not significantly different among small, medium, and large industries. However, administrative controls were statistically lower in small and medium industries compared to the large industries. Moreover, screening was statistically lower in small industries than in large industries. The mean risk factors of ventilation, use of common tools and equipment, and physical distance as well as total risk factors were not statistically different among different industries. CONCLUSION Workers are at risk of COVID-19 infection. The risk factors of ventilation, sharing tools and equipment, and physical distance are critical in classification of risk of infection with COVID-19 in industrial settings.;"https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-205045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120923/";05/06/2021;coronavirus;0.9119
719;Adjuvant corticosteroid therapy for critically ill patients with COVID-19;10.1101/2020.04.07.20056390;"Addition of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy to standard antiviral treatment of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is common in clinical practice. However, evidence is scarce regarding the efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids in patients who are critically ill. We retrospectively evaluated the effects of adjuvant corticosteroid treatment on the outcome of 244 critically ill patients with COVID-19, using a risk stratification model that adjusts for potential differences between the steroid group (n=151) and the non-steroid group (n=93). We observed that adjuvant corticosteroid therapy was independent from 28-day mortality, either in multivariate logistic regression of the entire cohort after adjustment for major mortality-associated variables (age, SpO2/FiO2, and lymphocyte count) and individual propensity score (adjusted OR: 1.05; 95% CI: -1.92-2.01), or in propensity score-matched (1:1 without replacement) case-control analysis (62 patients in 31 pairs; log-rank test P=0.17). Additionally, subgroup analyses of 147 (60%) patients who had dyspnea and 87 (36%) patients who had ARDS revealed corticosteroid treatment was not associated with clinical outcome (both, P>0.3). However, increased corticosteroids dosage was significantly associated with elevated mortality risk after adjustment for administration duration (P=0.003); every ten-milligram increase in hydrocortisone-equivalent dosage was associated with additional 4% mortality risk (adjusted HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07). Our findings indicated that limited effect of corticosteroid therapy could pose to overall survival and prudent dose within effective limits may be recommended for critically ill patients under certain circumstances.";"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.20056390v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056390";11/04/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9296
720;The Influenza A Virus H3N2 Triggers the Hypersusceptibility of Airway Inflammatory Response via Activating the lncRNA TUG1/miR-145-5p/NF-κB Pathway in COPD;10.3389/fphar.2021.604590;Background: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are more susceptible to influenza A virus (IAV) with more severe symptoms, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms of the hypersusceptibility of airway inflammatory response remain unclear. Methods: The primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pHBECs) were isolated from normal and COPD bronchial tissues (NHBE and DHBE) and cultured with/without IAV infection in vitro. DHBE cells were exposed to IAV for 24 h after knockdown of lncRNA TUG1 with short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Gain-of-function assays were performed with the miR-145-5p inhibitor and NF-κBp65 transfection. The expressions of lncRNA TUG1, miR-145-5p, phospho-NF-κBp65, NF-κBp65, TNF-α, and (Interleukin) IL-1β were examined with qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA. The interactions of lncRNA TUG1, miR-145-5p, and NF-κB were verified with luciferase reporter assay. Results: The expressions of lncRNA TUG1, phospho-NF-κBp65, TNF-α, and IL-1β were increased significantly in pHBECs after being infected with IAV for 24 h (all p0.05). The detailed time analysis revealed that the NF-κBp65 in DHBE was activated earlier than that in NHBE by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Knockdown of lncRNA TUG1 and miR-145-5p mimic attenuated the expressions of NF-κBp65, TNF-α, and IL-1β significantly. The miR-145-5p inhibitor and NF-κBp65 transfection reversed the attenuated expressions of NF-κBp65, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Conclusion: The IAV causes the hypersusceptibility of airway inflammatory response, which may be closely associated with more severe symptoms in AECOPD patients. The lncRNA TUG1 inhibitor may be a promising therapeutic strategy for AECOPD caused by IAV.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841139/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.604590";22/02/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9538
721;Association of coagulopathy with liver dysfunction in patients with COVID‐19;10.1111/hepr.13577;AIM: Liver dysfunction is sometimes observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), but most studies are from China, and the frequency in other countries is unclear. In addition, previous studies suggested several mechanisms of liver damage, but precise or additional mechanisms are not clearly elucidated. Therefore, we examined COVID‐19 patients to explore the proportion of patients with liver dysfunction and also the factors associated with liver dysfunction. METHODS: We retrospectively examined 60 COVID‐19 patients hospitalized at the Hospital affiliated with The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan). Patients who presented ≥40 U/L alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels at least once during their hospitalization were defined as high‐ALT patients, and the others as normal‐ALT patients. The worst values of physical and laboratory findings during hospitalization for each patient were extracted for the analyses. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models with bootstrap (for 1000 times) were carried out. RESULTS: Among 60 patients, there were 31 (52%) high‐ALT patients. The high‐ALT patients were obese, and had significantly higher levels of D‐dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, as well as white blood cell count, and levels of C‐reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen. Multivariable analysis showed D‐dimer and white blood cells as independent factors. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that higher D‐dimer level and white blood cell count were independently associated with ALT elevation, liver dysfunction in COVID‐19 patients might be induced by microvascular thrombosis in addition to systemic inflammation.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33047431/; https://doi.org/10.1111/hepr.13577";27/10/2020;liver dysfunction;0.9714
722;Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections with colorimetric RT-LAMP and LAMP sequencing;10.1101/2020.05.05.20092288;"The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a significant public-health problem. In order to control the pandemic, rapid tests for detecting existing infections and assessing virus spread are critical. Approaches to detect viral RNA based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) hold outstanding promise towards greatly simplified and broadly applicable testing methods. RT-LAMP assays appear more robust than qPCR-based methods and only require incubation at a constant temperature, thus eliminating the need for sophisticated instrumentation. Here, we tested a two-color RT-LAMP protocol using clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples and also established a protocol that does not require prior RNA isolation (""swab-to-RT-LAMP""). Our study is based on several hundred clinical patient samples with a wide range of viral loads, thus allowing, for the first time, to accurately determine the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. We found that RT-LAMP can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 samples with a qPCR threshold cycle number (CT value) of up to 30 in the standard RT-qPCR assay. We used both, either purified RNA or direct pharyngeal swab specimens and showed that RT-LAMP assays have, despite a decreased sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, excellent specificity. We also developed a multiplexed LAMP-sequencing protocol as a validation and backup procedure to double-check the results of visual RT-LAMP assays. LAMP-sequencing is fully scalable and can assess the results of thousands of LAMP reactions in parallel.

This is the first study to investigate mental health, i. e. adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, Corona related fears as well as coping mechanisms in this group in a German-speaking country. MATERIAL AND METHODS In April 2020, N=100 subjects were recruited that currently are engaged in a hospital. A series of standardized assessments were included: adjustment disorder (ADNM-20), depression (PHQ-9), stress symptoms and coping strategies (SCI). Currently, cross-sectional data are analyzed, because the study is still going on and longitudinal data is not yet assessed. RESULTS Frequencies of adjustment disorder and depression are 8 and 15%, respectively. Two hierarchical regression models were run to predict adjustment disorder and depression; predictive power was higher for the first (41 vs. 35%). Fear of infection was reported to be higher regarding one's family than oneself. Nursing staff, those with preloads, and women were found to report more mental health problems. Those with direct contact to people that fell ill with COVID-19 did not differ from those with no direct contact. DISCUSSION Currently, medical staff has a high risk for being mentally stressed. China, being epidemically experienced, has published principles for psychiatric interventions in January 2020. This might be relevant for Switzerland, too.

Empowering patients and their care-partners, including family members or friends involved in their care, may help minimize burden and consequences of CKD-related symptoms to enable life participation. There is a need to broaden the focus on living well with kidney disease and re-engagement in life, including emphasis on patients being in control. The World Kidney Day (WKD) Joint Steering Committee has declared 2021 the year of ""Living Well with Kidney Disease"" in an effort to increase education and awareness on the important goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This calls for the development and implementation of validated patient-reported outcome measures to assess and address areas of life participation in routine care. It could be supported by regulatory agencies as a metric for quality care or to support labelling claims for medicines and devices. Funding agencies could establish targeted calls for research that address the priorities of patients. Patients with kidney disease and their care-partners should feel supported to live well through concerted efforts by kidney care communities including during pandemics. In the overall wellness program for kidney disease patients, the need for prevention should be reiterated.

725;Road traffic injuries in Nepal during COVID-19 lockdown.;10.12688/f1000research.26281.1;Background: As the world is busy addressing COVID-19, road traffic injuries, another major cause of deaths is continuously killing people on the roads. In Nepal, there were frequent media reports of occurrences of road crashes, injuries, and deaths despite nationwide lockdown. This paper aims to describe the situation of road traffic crashes and casualties during the period of complete lockdown. Methods: This study used secondary data from two sources: Nepal Police and media reports between 24 March and 14 June 2020 (because the government lifted the nationwide lockdown from 15 June 2020). Available details of crashes, deaths, and injuries for this period were extracted from media reports and the summary data that was obtained from the Police. Narrative comparison is done between the data for the same period from both the sources, where possible. Results: Nepal Police recorded 1,801 incidents of road crashes during the 82 days of the COVID-19 lockdown with 256 deaths (on average 3.1 deaths daily) and 1,824 injuries (on average 22.2 injuries daily). Motorcycles comprised over 21% of all vehicles involved in crashes. Ambulances and other vehicles for essential services were also found to be involved in crashes. Speeding itself was the cause for almost a quarter of the incidents during the lockdown. Conclusions: Even when the movement restrictions were imposed in Nepal, the number of road crashes was not substantially reduced. Media reports were mainly found to be reporting the crashes where deaths occurred, but police records also included nonfatal injuries. The incidence of crashes in this period shows that it is important to work for road safety to save lives from road traffic crashes in Nepal.;"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.26281.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520194/";01/01/2020;road traffic injuries;0.9266
726;Anticoagulant interventions in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: A scoping review of randomized controlled trials and call for international collaboration.;10.1111/jth.15094;INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a high incidence of thrombosis and mortality despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. There is equipoise regarding the optimal dose of anticoagulant intervention in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and consequently, immediate answers from high-quality randomized trials are needed. METHODS The World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform was searched on June 17, 2020 for randomized controlled trials comparing increased dose to standard dose anticoagulant interventions in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Two authors independently screened the full records for eligibility and extracted data in duplicate. RESULTS A total of 20 trials were included in the review. All trials are open-label, 5 trials use an adaptive design, 1 trial uses a factorial design, 2 trials combine multi-arm parallel group and factorial designs in flexible platform trials, and at least 15 trials have multiple study sites. With individual target sample sizes ranging from 30 to 3,000 participants, the pooled sample size of all included trials is 12,568 participants. Two trials include only ICU patients, and 10 trials base patient eligibility on elevated D-dimer levels. Therapeutic intensity anticoagulation is evaluated in 14 trials. All-cause mortality is part of the primary outcome in 14 trials. DISCUSSION Several trials evaluate different dose regimens of anticoagulant interventions in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

727;COVID-19 DEATH TOLL: THE ROLE OF THE NATION'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT;10.1101/2020.07.18.20156778;Background: Several months into the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a limited understanding of the underlying country-specific factors associated with COVID-19 spread and mortality. This study aims to investigate the role of nations' economic development in the death toll associated with COVID-19 in Europe and Israel. Methods: Number of COVID-19 cases, deaths per million, and case fatality rate (CFR) in Israel and 39 countries in Europe were described across quintiles of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The association between GDP per capita and COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and CFR was investigated using generalized linear modeling adjusting for the proportion of elderly and density of the population. Results: In countries belonging to the three lower GDP quintiles, COVID-19 incidence rates per million (range 708-1134) were substantially lower compared to countries in the fourth (3939) and fifth (3476) quintiles. Major differences were also calculated in COVID-19 mortality rates per million (25-31 vs. 222-268). There was no significant (p=0.19) differences in CFR between GDP quintiles (range: 2.79-7.62%). Conclusions: COVID-19 had a greater toll in more developed nations. Though comparisons are limited by differences in testing, reporting and lockdown policies, this association likely reflects increased spread from trade and tourism in wealthier countries, whereas limited health system capacity and lack of treatment and vaccination options contributed to higher than expected CFR in wealthier countries. This unique situation will probably encourage the stronger economies to invest the required financial capacity to respond to and recover from the current crisis.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.18.20156778v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.18.20156778";21/07/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9867
728;multiSero: open multiplex-ELISA platform for analyzing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection;10.1101/2021.05.07.21249238;Serology has provided valuable diagnostic and epidemiological data on antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in diverse patient cohorts. Deployment of high content, multiplex serology platforms across the world, including in low and medium income countries, can accelerate longitudinal epidemiological surveys. Here we report multiSero, an open platform to enable multiplex serology with up to 48 antigens in a 96-well format. The platform consists of three components: ELISA-array of printed proteins, a commercial or home-built plate reader, and modular python software for automated analysis (pysero). We validate the platform by comparing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N) in 114 sera from COVID-19 positive individuals and 87 pre-pandemic COVID-19 negative sera. We report data with both a commercial plate reader and an inexpensive, open plate reader (nautilus). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of classification with single antigens shows that Spike and RBD classify positive and negative sera with the highest sensitivity at a given specificity. The platform distinguished positive sera from negative sera when the reactivity of the sera was equivalent to the binding of 1 ng mL(−1) RBD-specific monoclonal antibody. We developed normalization and classification methods to pool antibody responses from multiple antigens and multiple experiments. Our results demonstrate a performant and accessible pipeline for multiplexed ELISA ready for multiple applications, including serosurveillance, identification of viral proteins that elicit antibody responses, differential diagnosis of circulating pathogens, and immune responses to vaccines.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.21249238; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.07.21249238v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013298/";11/05/2021;receptor binding domain;0.9256
729;Pseudomembranous conjunctivitis with hand, foot and mouth disease in a pregnant woman : a case report;10.1186/s12886-021-01878-7;BACKGROUND: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common systemic infection that is caused by an enterovirus, normally Coxsackie A16. Generally, it affects children or immunocompromised adults. Only a few reports have described pseudomembranous conjunctivitis associated with HFMD. We aim to describe the clinical outcomes and ocular findings of a 37-year-old female with HFMD and concurrent severe pseudomembranous conjunctivitis, who was 28 weeks pregnant. CASE PRESENTATION: A female patient who was 28-weeks pregnant was referred for an ophthalmological review due to pain and injection in both eyes. The patient was hospitalized under obstetrics and gynecology and evaluated for Behcet’s disease with oral and perineal ulcers. In an ophthalmic examination, both eyes were observed to have a conjunctival injection. Behcet’s disease-associated conjunctivitis was diagnosed. Topical steroids and antibiotics were administered every 6 h. Two days after her presentation, a maculopapular eruption occurred on her palms. Enterovirus type 71 was detected in a serum virus antibody test, and the patient was diagnosed with HFMD. After 7 days, severe pseudomembranous conjunctivitis and corneal epithelial defects occurred in both eyes. Topical steroids were administered every 3 h, and the pseudomembrane was removed every 2 to 3 days. The pseudomembrane did not occur after 3 weeks, but corneal erosion persisted. After 3 months, the corneal erosion had completely resolved. CONCLUSIONS: HFMD-associated conjunctivitis is a rare complication in adults, however it can appear as a severe pseudomembranous conjunctivitis. In this case, the removal of the pseudomembrane and topical steroids helped improve the symptoms.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7922717/;02/03/2021;Hand, foot, and mouth disease;0.963
730;Temporospatial characterization of the bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) of the one humped camel (Camelus dromedarius);10.1007/s11250-021-02694-3;BACKGROUND: Bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is responsible for the local immune response of the lung against airborne infections. The structure of this tissue varies according to species and age. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the possible age-related structural variation of the BALT of the one humped camel. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fresh specimens from both lungs of 15 clinically healthy male camels (10 months–12 years) were studied with light and electron microscopes. RESULTS: The BALT in the camel was variable from few lymphocytes to well-organized lymphoid tissue with a clear germinal center. The BALT of the bronchi is a constant lymphoid tissue in young and adult camels which may be of the large size with clear germinal center in response to repeated immune reaction and involutes in old age. The BALT of the bronchioles may be induced and develops mainly due to an immune reaction and showed great morphological variations and observed in different ages. High endothelial venules were associated with BALT in the bronchi but not with that of the bronchioles. The BALT-associated epithelium was tall pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium with goblet cells in the extrapulmonary bronchi changed to pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium mucous secreting cells in the intrapulmonary bronchi and simple columnar ciliated to simple cuboidal epithelium with Clara cells without goblet cells or mucous secreting cells in the bronchioles. CONCLUSIONS: The BALT of the bronchi is a constant lymphoid tissue in young and adult camels and involutes in old age. The BALT of the bronchioles may be induced and develops mainly due to an immune reaction and observed in different ages.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33864535/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02694-3";17/04/2021;Bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue;0.9574
731;Integrating Harm Reduction into Outpatient Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Settings: Harm Reduction in Outpatient Addiction Treatment;10.1007/s11606-021-06904-4;Opioid use disorder (OUD) is increasingly recognized as a chronic, relapsing brain disease whose treatment should be integrated into primary care settings alongside other chronic conditions. However, abstinence from all non-prescribed substance use continues to be prioritized as the only desired goal in many outpatient, primary care–based treatment programs. This presents a barrier to engagement for patients who continue to use substances and who may be at high risk for complications of ongoing substance use such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), superficial and deep tissue infections, and overdose. Harm reduction aims to reduce the negative consequences of substance use and offers an alternative to abstinence as a singular goal. Incorporating harm reduction principles into primary care treatment settings can support programs in engaging patients with ongoing substance use and facilitate the delivery of evidence-based screening and prevention services. The objective of this narrative review is to describe strategies for the integration of evidence-based harm reduction principles and interventions into outpatient, primary care–based OUD treatment settings. We will offer specific tools for providers and programs including strategies to support safer injection practices, assess the risks and benefits of continuing medications for opioid use disorder in the setting of ongoing substance use, promote a non-stigmatizing program culture, and address the needs of special populations with ongoing substance use including adolescents, parents, and families.

732;Opioid-related Emergency Department Visits During COVID-19 in a Large Health System.;10.1097/adm.0000000000000850;OBJECTIVE Multiple states have reported increases in opioid overdose deaths during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, however little is known about opioid-related presentations to the emergency department (ED). METHODS This was a time series analysis of visits to 7 EDs in greater Chicago, Illinois from October 20, 2019 to July 25, 2020. We compared the number of ED visits for opioid-related diagnoses in the time period preceding the World Health Organization pandemic declaration (prepandemic period, October 20, 2019-July 3, 2020) to the time period following the World Health Organization declaration (pandemic period, March 8, 2020 to July 25, 2020) using a single-group interrupted time series analysis with Newey-West standard errors. We also present data on alcohol-related ED visits for comparison. RESULTS We evaluated a total of 177,405 visits across the 7 EDs during the study period. The mean number of weekly ED visits in the prepandemic and pandemic periods was 4841 and 4029 weekly visits, respectively. In the interrupted time series analysis, there was no significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on opioid-related ED visits (-0.44 visits per 1000 ED visits, 95% CI -2.47 to 1.58, P = 0.66), however, there was a significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on alcohol-related ED visits (-4.1, 95% CI: -8.25 to -0.01, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Despite reductions in overall ED visit volumes and alcohol-related visits during COVID-19, the number of opioid-related visits was not significantly reduced during the early pandemic. These data reinforce the need to provide comprehensive treatment services for opioid use disorder during the co-occurring COVID-19 and opioid crises.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870952/";15/04/2021;CONCLUSIONS;0.9392
733;Accuracy of matching residential postal codes to census geography.;10.25318/82-003-x202000300001-eng;BACKGROUND Postal codes are often the only geographic identifier available to match subjects in a health dataset to census geography. This paper describes the characteristics of postal codes reported by the Canadian population on the census and, as an indicator of geocoding accuracy, the proportion that are linked to a single dissemination area (DA). DATA AND METHODS Postal codes reported on the 2016 Census questionnaire were matched to a combination of the Postal Code Conversion File (PCCF) and the Postal Code Conversion File Plus (PCCF+ version 7B) (reference date November 2018) to calculate population-weighted counts and the number of matches to DAs by province or territory, delivery mode type (DMT), population centre or rural area size, and census metropolitan area. The number of single matches to census tracts (CTs), census subdivisions (CSDs) and census divisions (CDs) was also calculated. RESULTS In Canada, 72.6% of the population reported postal codes that matched to a single DA. This proportion was higher in urban cores (87.1%) and among postal codes for an urban street address (DMT=A) (85.3%) or apartment building (DMT=B) (95.3%), and was lower in rural areas (26.2% to 38.1%) and among rural postal codes (13.9%). In comparison, 89.3% and 95.4% of the population reported postal codes matching to a single CSD or CD, respectively, while 92.1% of the population that live within CT boundaries were matched to a single CT. DISCUSSION Matching postal codes to census geography is relatively accurate and frequently one to one in urban centres. In rural areas and for some types of postal code DMTs, alternative approaches to using the PCCF and PCCF+ for attaching census geography might be explored.;"https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000300001-eng; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32644759/";17/06/2020;apartment building;0.9567
734;An Update on Pulmonary Hypertension in Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19).;10.23750/abm.v91i4.10698;Coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) continues to be a pandemic with global implications. Respiratory system involvement is the most common manifestation in symptomatic patients. In this literature review, we describe the diagnosis, management, and implications of pulmonary hypertension (PH) among patients with COVID-19. We defined pulmonary hypertension as increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest. In our literature search, we identified 4 articles with details on pulmonary hypertension. Among these, two reported various echocardiographic details for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension. In 1 study evidence of pulmonary hypertension was noted in 13.4% of patients. Patients with severe COVID-19 were reported to have a higher proportion of pulmonary hypertension as compared to mild COVID-19 disease [22% vs 2%]. Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was significant in predicting mortality. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial injury, pulmonary embolism, and prior pulmonary hypertension were at a higher risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension. Multiple mechanisms for developing pulmonary hypertension that have been postulated are i) concomitant worsening myocardial injury, ii) cytokine storm, endothelial injury, hypercoagulability attributing to development of venous thromboembolism, iii) and the presence of thrombotic microangiopathy. Among patients with severe COVID-19 disease and pulmonary hypertension, complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, the requirement of intensive care unit admission, the requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality are higher.;"https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i4.10698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525228/";10/11/2020;Coronavirus 19 disease;0.9863

Dans un second temps, l’extubation est possible et plusieurs aspects sont développés : la kinésithérapie respiratoire, l’oxygénation, la déglutition et surtout la réhabilitation. Cependant, des atteintes du parenchyme pulmonaire abaissent de façon importante la saturation en oxygène au cours des exercices.

736;Expanding the Vision for Differentiated Service Delivery: A Call for More Inclusive and Truly Patient-Centered Care for People Living With HIV;10.1097/qai.0000000000002549;Simplifying antiretroviral therapy for clinically stable people living with HIV (PLHIV) is important but insufficient to meet their health care needs, including prevention and treatment of tuberculosis and noncommunicable diseases, routine primary care, and family planning. Integrating these services into differentiated service delivery (DSD) platforms is a promising avenue to achieve such coverage. We propose a transition from an HIV-focused “DSD 1.0” to a patient-centered “DSD 2.0” that is inclusive of additional chronic care services for PLHIV. DISCUSSION: The lack of coordination between HIV programs and these critical services puts a burden on both PLHIV and health systems. For individual patients, fractionated services increase cost and time, diminish the actual and perceived quality of care, and increase the risk that they will disengage from health care altogether. The burden on the health system is one of inefficiency and suboptimal outcomes resulting from the parallel systems required to manage multiple vertical programs. CONCLUSIONS: DSD 2.0 provides an opportunity for the HIV and Universal Health Coverage agendas—which can seem to be at odds—to achieve greater collective impact for patients and health systems by integrating strong vertical HIV, tuberculosis and family planning programs, and relatively weaker noncommunicable disease programs. Increasing coordination of care for PLHIV will increase the likelihood of achieving and sustaining UNAIDS′ goals of retention on antiretroviral therapy and viral suppression. Eventually, this shift to DSD 2.0 for PLHIV could evolve to a more person-centered vision of chronic care services that would also serve the general population.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33136818/; https://doi.org/10.1097/qai.0000000000002549";01/02/2021;differentiated service delivery;0.9524
737;Factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in patients with multiple sclerosis: A systematic review;10.1101/2021.06.11.21258765;Background: We conducted this systematic review to identify factors associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) susceptibility and outcomes among people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Available studies from PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and gray literature including reference list and conference abstracts were searched from December 1, 2019, through April 12, 2021. We included cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies that reported risk factors of contracting COVID-19 or its outcome in patients with MS on univariate or multivariate regression analyses. Results: Out of the initial 2719 records and 1553 conference abstracts, a total of 20 studies were included. Factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility were reported in 11 studies and risk factors for infection outcomes were discussed in 10. History of contact with an infected is strongly suggested as a risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility. Other factors that could be associated with contracting infection are younger age, relapsing course, and anti-CD20 agents. The evidence suggests that increasing age, greater MS severity, treatment with anti-CD20 agents, previous use of corticosteroids, and specific comorbidities (obesity and coronary artery disease) could be independently associated with worse infection outcomes. Male sex is likely to be a risk factor for more severe disease. The black or African American race was reported as a possible risk factor. Conclusion: Due to a paucity of research and methodological issues, no risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes neither be confirmed nor excluded. Further large studies are needed to address factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.11.21258765v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.11.21258765";15/06/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9868
738;Evaluation of High Flow Local Extraction on control of the aerosol plume in an operating theatre;10.1101/2021.05.16.21257155;"Background Engineering controls are a necessity for minimising aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, yet so far, little attention has been given to such interventions. High flow local extraction (HFLE) is a standard in other industries that deal with airborne contaminants. This study provides a quantitative evaluation of an HFLE concept feasible to implement in most real clinical settings. Method A unique combined experimental model of Laser sheet illumination videography paired with continuous nanoparticle counts was used to quantitatively assess the impact of HFLE in an operating theatre. Propylene Glycol was aerosolised via a customised physiological lung simulator and dispersion was measured in 3 dimensions. Cumulative probability heat maps were generated to describe aerosol behaviour. Continuous particle counts were made at 15 locations throughout the room to validate laser assessments. Results HFLE effectively reduced dispersion of simulated exhaled aerosols to undetectable levels. With the HFLE in operation and optimally positioned, the aerosol plume was tightly controlled. Particle counts remained at baseline when HFLE was active. HFLE becomes less effective with increasing distance from source. Plume behaviour in the absence of HFLE was highly variable and unpredictable. Conclusions This analysis demonstrates great potential for HFLE to have a significant impact in reducing aerosol transmission. Simple HFLE devices can be easily engineered and could be widely deployed without impacting on the safe delivery of care.

739;Ex vivo infection of murine precision-cut lung tissue slices with Mycobacterium abscessus: a model to study antimycobacterial agents;10.1186/s12941-020-00399-3;BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant infections due to Mycobacterium abscessus often require complex and prolonged regimens for treatment. Here, we report the evaluation of a new ex vivo antimicrobial susceptibility testing model using organotypic cultures of murine precision-cut lung slices, an experimental model in which metabolic activity, and all the usual cell types of the organ are found while the tissue architecture and the interactions between the different cells are maintained. METHODS: Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared from the lungs of wild type BALB/c mice using the Krumdieck(®) tissue slicer. Lung tissue slices were ex vivo infected with the virulent M. abscessus strain L948. Then, we tested the antimicrobial activity of two drugs: imipenem (4, 16 and 64 μg/mL) and tigecycline (0.25, 1 and 4 μg/mL), at 12, 24 and 48 h. Afterwards, CFUs were determined plating on blood agar to measure the surviving intracellular bacteria. The viability of PCLS was assessed by Alamar Blue assay and corroborated using histopathological analysis. RESULTS: PCLS were successfully infected with a virulent strain of M. abscessus as demonstrated by CFUs and detailed histopathological analysis. The time-course infection, including tissue damage, parallels in vivo findings reported in genetically modified murine models for M. abscessus infection. Tigecycline showed a bactericidal effect at 48 h that achieved a reduction of > 4log(10) CFU/mL against the intracellular mycobacteria, while imipenem showed a bacteriostatic effect. CONCLUSIONS: The use of this new organotypic ex vivo model provides the opportunity to test new drugs against M. abscessus, decreasing the use of costly and tedious animal models.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680588/;22/11/2020;Multidrug-resistant infections;0.9042
740;An update on novel COVID-19 pandemic: a battle between humans and virus.;10.26355/eurrev_202005_21377;In the 21st century, human civilization has witnessed three major epidemics caused by Coronaviruses namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) in 2012 and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) or coronavirus disease (COVID 19) in 2019. Among these, COVID-19 has greater transmission and mortality rate. 2019 nCoV belongs to a large family of positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species. The most communal symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath during the incubation period (2-14 days) of infection. COVID-19 transmission is occurring from infected humans to close contact with one another through respiratory droplets, coughs, and sneezes of infected person. Moreover, the virus containing surfaces may also transmit the infection. Diagnosis is being carried out by collecting a nasopharyngeal swab or sputum specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rapid diagnosing methods are also under development which can diagnose COVID 19 in few minutes to hours. Currently, there is no specific cure or preventive therapeutics available. Hence, based upon limited in-vitro and anecdotal data, Chloroquine, or Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir are being employed in the management. Search for new specific anti-viral drugs from natural/synthetic origins is under full swing and many of them are currently used as chemotherapeutic drugs under clinical investigation. Yet, there is a strong need for development of vaccine, which may take several months to few years for the development.;"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202005_21377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32495921/";01/05/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9578
741;Transfer learning to detect COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images, using convolutional neural networks;10.1101/2020.08.25.20182170;Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a contagious disease that has already caused thousands of deaths and infected millions of people worldwide. Thus, all technological gadgets that allow the fast detection of COVID- 19 infection with high accuracy can offer help to healthcare professionals. This study is purposed to explore the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and reliable detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray imaging. In this study, reliable pre-trained deep learning algorithms were applied to achieve the automatic detection of COVID-19-induced pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images. Moreover, the study aims to evaluate the performance of advanced neural architectures proposed for the classification of medical images over recent years. The data set used in the experiments involves 274 COVID-19 cases, 380 viral pneumonia, and 380 healthy cases, which was derived from several open sources of X-Rays, and the data available online. The confusion matrix provided a basis for testing the post-classification model. Furthermore, an open-source library PYCM was used to support the statistical parameters. The study revealed the superiority of Model vgg16 over other models applied to conduct this research where the model performed best in terms of overall scores and based-class scores. According to the research results, deep Learning with X-ray imaging is useful in the collection of critical biological markers associated with COVID-19 infection.

742;Investigation of the inhibitory activity of some dietary bioactive flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2 using molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA calculations.;10.1080/07391102.2021.1891139;Eventhough the development of vaccine against COVID-19 pandemic is progressing in different part of the world a well-defined treatment plan is not yet developed. Therefore, we investigate the inhibitory activity of a group of dietary bioactive flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which are identified as one of the potential targets in the drug discovery process of COVID-19. After the initial virtual screening of a number of bioactive flavonoids, the binding affinity of three compounds - Naringin, Naringenin and Amentoflavone - at the active site of Mpro was investigated through MD Simulations, MM-PBSA and DFT Binding Energy calculations. From the MD trajectory analysis, Amentoflavone and Naringin showed consistent protein-ligand interactions with the aminoacid residues of the active site domains of Mpro. The excellent inhibitory activity of Amentoflavone and Naringin was established from its MM-PBSA binding energy values of -190.50 and -129.87 kJ/mol respectively. The MET165 residue of Mpro is identified as one of the key residue which contributed significantly to MM-PBSA binding energy through hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, the DFT binding energy values of Amentoflavone (-182.92 kJ/mol) and Naringin (-160.67 kJ/mol) in active site molecular clusters with hydrogen bonds confirmed their potential inhibitory activity. These compounds are of high interest because of their wide availability, low cost, no side effects, and long history of use. We can prevent the severity of this disease for home care patients using these effective dietary supplements. We are hopeful that our results have implications for the development of prophylaxis of COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

743;Paracetamol, NSAIDs, and glucocorticoids for postoperative pain: a protocol for a systematic review with meta-analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis.;10.1111/aas.13943;BACKGROUND Multimodal analgesia is the leading principle for managing postoperative pain. Recent guidelines recommend combinations of paracetamol and an NSAID for most surgeries. Glucocorticoids have been used for decades due to their potent anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Subsequently, glucocorticoids may improve postoperative analgesia. We will perform a systematic review to assess benefits and harms of adding glucocorticoids to paracetamol and NSAIDs. We expect to uncover pros and cons of the addition of glucocorticoid to the basic standard regimen of paracetamol and NSAIDs for postoperative analgesia. METHOD This protocol for a systematic review was written according to the The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. We will search for trials in the following electronic databases: Medline, CENTRAL, CDSR and Embase. Two authors will independently screen trials for inclusion using Covidence, extract data and assess risk of bias using Cochrane's ROB 2 tool.

744;Anti-IL5 Therapies for Severe Eosinophilic Asthma: Literature Review and Practical Insights;10.2147/jaa.s258594;Severe refractory asthma (SRA) still has a high economic and social impact, including a reduction in quality of life (QoL), productivity, a greater risk of exacerbations and emergency department (ED) visits. Another major issue is the need of oral corticosteroids (OCS), often due to a poor response to standard therapies or the lack of indication for currently available biological drugs. A thorough understanding of the immunological pathways and eosinophilopoietic processes allows a correct application of the new pharmacological strategies and leads to better clinical responses. For these unmet needs, several monoclonal antibody (mAb) drugs have been introduced over the past few years. These are mainly available for allergic and especially eosinophilic uncontrolled refractory asthma. As the number of therapeutic options increases, the choice of biological drugs can be made only after careful considerations of the particular asthma endotype, patients’ comorbidities and clinical data. The selection of the correct therapeutic option can therefore be guided after a careful evaluation of the particular endotype and phenotype, from the combined evaluation of inflammatory biomarkers, clinical picture and comorbidities. The careful evaluation of all these parameters can therefore help the physician in the optimal management of these complex patients, for whom it is often possible to achieve exceptional results by managing the available options in the best possible way. The aim of this review is to define the positioning of the biological drugs currently available for type 2 asthma, with a special focus on options for eosinophilic asthma in the context of the most recent knowledge of immunological pathways.;"https://doi.org/10.2147/jaa.s258594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982318/";09/09/2020;emergency department;0.9578
745;A buprenorphine-validated rat model of opioid use disorder optimized to study sex differences in vulnerability to relapse;10.1007/s00213-020-05750-2;"RATIONALE: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major epidemic in the USA. Despite evidence indicating that OUD may be particularly severe for women, preclinical models have yet to establish sex as a major factor in OUD. OBJECTIVES: Here, we examined sex differences in vulnerability to relapse following intermittent access fentanyl self-administration and protracted abstinence and used buprenorphine, the FDA-approved treatment for OUD, to test the validity of our model. METHODS: Following acquisition of fentanyl self-administration under one of two training conditions, male and female rats were given extended, 24-h/day access to fentanyl (0.25 μg/kg/infusion, 10 days) using an intermittent access procedure. Vulnerability to relapse was assessed using an extinction/cue-induced reinstatement procedure following 14 days of abstinence; buprenorphine (0 or 3 mg/kg/day) was administered throughout abstinence. RESULTS: Levels of drug-seeking were high following extended-access fentanyl self-administration and abstinence; buprenorphine markedly decreased drug-seeking supporting the validity of our relapse model. Females self-administered more fentanyl and responded at higher levels during subsequent extinction testing. Buprenorphine was effective in both sexes and eliminated sex and estrous phase differences in drug-seeking. Interestingly, the inclusion of a time-out during training had a major impact on later fentanyl self-administration in females, but not males, indicating that the initial exposure conditions can persistently impact vulnerability in females. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the utility of this rat model for determining sex and hormonal influences on the development and treatment of OUD.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33404740/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-020-05750-2";06/01/2021;Opioid use disorder;0.9744

However, travel to in-person workshops can be time-consuming and expensive. Thus, we developed a free online course to provide training in IYCF to health professionals globally; the course received overwhelmingly high numbers of registrations. Our aim was to conduct a program evaluation to assess course satisfaction, learning, and application using surveys administered postcourse and 9 months later. Response rates were 99% (n = 835) and 55% (n = 312), respectively. Among those who only partially completed the course, reasons for noncompletion were assessed (response rate 29%, n = 72). Data within a 1-year period were analyzed. Respondents worked in multiple settings and organizations worldwide. Nearly all (99%) reported postcourse that they learned “a lot” or “some” from all topics, and over 70% applied “a lot” of or “some” information 9 months later. In open-ended questions, respondents reported improved knowledge, skills, and competence to conduct their work; they also desired more similar training courses. Many who did not complete the course reported “not enough time” as the main reason (74%), and most (94%) wanted to continue it. The positive response to the course suggests there is an unmet need for CPD for health professionals in LMICs. Our evaluation found that online training was feasible, acceptable, and increased professionals' knowledge and application of IYCF concepts in nutrition programming.

747;Respiratory syncytial virus associated hospitalizations among adults with chronic medical conditions.;10.1093/cid/ciaa730;BACKGROUND In contrast with respiratory disease caused by influenza, information on the risk of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease among adults with chronic medical conditions (CMCs) is limited. METHODS We linked population based surveillance of acute respiratory illness hospitalizations to national administrative data, to estimate seasonal RSV hospitalization rates among adults aged 18-80 years with certain pre-existing CMCs: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), diabetes mellitus (DM), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Age and ethnicity adjusted rates stratified by age group were estimated. RESULTS Among 883,999 adult residents aged 18-80 years, 281 RSV positive hospitalizations were detected during 2012-2015 winter seasons. Across all ages, RSV hospitalization rates were significantly higher among adults with COPD, asthma, CHF, and CAD compared to those without each corresponding condition. RSV hospitalization rates were significantly higher among adults with ESRD aged 50-64 years and adults with DM aged 65-80 years compared to adults in each age group without these conditions. No increased risk was seen for adults with CVA. The CMC with the highest risk of RSV hospitalization was CHF (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] range: 4.6-36.5 across age strata) and COPD (IRR range: 9.6-9.7). Among RSV positive adults, CHF and COPD were independently associated with increased length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS Adults with specific CMCs are at increased risk of RSV hospitalizations. Age affects this relationship for some CMCs. Such populations maybe relevant for future RSV prevention strategies.;"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531019/";12/06/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9743
748;Short‐term neuropsychiatric outcomes and quality of life in COVID‐19 survivors;10.1111/joim.13262;BACKGROUND: The general medical impacts of coronavirus (COVID‐19) are increasingly appreciated. However, its impact on neurocognitive, psychiatric health and quality of life (QoL) in survivors after the acute phase is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate neurocognitive function, psychiatric symptoms and QoL in COVID‐19 survivors shortly after hospital discharge. METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional analysis of a prospective study of hospitalized COVID‐19 survivors followed up for 2 months after discharge. A battery of standardized instruments evaluating neurocognitive function, psychiatric morbidity and QoL (mental and physical components) was administered by telephone. RESULTS: Of the 229 screened patients, 179 were included in the final analysis. Amongst survivors, the prevalence of moderately impaired immediate verbal memory and learning was 38%, delayed verbal memory (11.8%), verbal fluency (34.6%) and working memory (executive function) (6.1%), respectively. Moreover, 58.7% of patients had neurocognitive impairment in at least one function. Rates of positive screening for anxiety, depression and post‐traumatic stress disorder were 29.6%, 26.8% and 25.1%, respectively. In addition, 39.1% of the patients had psychiatric morbidity. Low QoL for physical and mental components was detected in 44.1% and 39.1% of patients respectively. Delirium and psychiatric morbidity were associated with neurocognitive impairment, and female gender was related with psychiatric morbidity. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized COVID‐19 survivors showed a considerable prevalence of neurocognitive impairment, psychiatric morbidity and poor QoL in the short term. It is uncertain if these impacts persist over the long term.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.13262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533521/";13/03/2021;coronavirus;0.9909

In Nepal, the number of COVID-19 is increasing day-by-day. This research was done to find out the impact of COVID-19 on dentists, patients, and dental practice in Nepal. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study conducted using an online survey from May 10 to17, 2020. A questionnaire was designed and uploaded in Freeonlinesurveys.com. Following ethical approval, the questionnaire was distributed among 500 dentists, and 406 dentists participated in the study. The survey link was dispersed to the Nepali dentists through social media and e-mail, and the results of the responses were received online. The questionnaire consisted of a total of 34 closed-ended questions containing three parts; demographic details, knowledge of dentists on COVID-19, and the impact of COVID-19 on dentists, patients, and dental treatments. RESULTS: It showed that majority of the participants were females 243 (60%) of the age group 25-29 years with the clinic as the workplace. Patients receive dental treatments only from 40 (10%) of the dentist. A high number of dentists: 284 (70%) were severely affected by the financial burden and were not receiving a salary during this lockdown. About 349(86%) of the dentist think they should do regular dental treatments, but only 101 (25%) think the dentist should do only dental emergency treatments for COVID-19 infected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Dentists, patients, and dental practice are severely affected by the COVID-19. The majority of the dentists have faced financial burdens. The dental treatments should be done with high standards of care and infection control following proper recommendations.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7654486/;31/10/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9712
750;Understanding preferences for HIV care among patients experiencing homelessness or unstable-housing: A discrete choice experiment.;10.1097/qai.0000000000002476;"BACKGROUND Homelessness and unstable housing (HUH) negatively impact care outcomes for people living with HIV (PLWH). To inform design of a clinic program for PLWH experiencing HUH, we quantified patient preferences and trade-offs across multiple HIV-service domains using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS We sequentially sampled PLWH experiencing HUH presenting at an urban HIV clinic with missed primary care visit and viremia in the last year to conduct a DCE. Participants chose between two hypothetical clinics varying across five service attributes: care team ""get to know me as a person"" versus not; receiving $10, $15 or $20 gift cards for clinic visits; drop-in versus scheduled visits; direct phone communication to care team versus front-desk staff; staying 2 versus 20 blocks from the clinic. We estimated attribute relative utility (i.e., preference) using mixed-effects logistic regression and calculated the monetary trade-off of preferred options. RESULTS Among 65 individuals interviewed, 61% were >40 years-old; 45% white; 77% male; 25% heterosexual; 56% lived outdoors/emergency housing, and 44% in temporary housing. Strongest preferences were for patient-centered care team (β = 3.80; 95%CI 2.57-5.02) and drop-in clinic appointments (β = 1.33; 95%CI 0.85-1.80), with a willingness to trade $32.79 (95%CI 14.75-50.81) and $11.45 (95%CI 2.95-19.95) in gift cards/visit, respectively. CONCLUSION In this DCE, PLWH-HUH were willing to trade significant financial gain to have a personal relationship with and drop-in access to their care team rather than clinic proximity and gift cards.

A total of 1523 patients with a current or past diagnosis of solid tumors and diagnosed with COVID-19 (confirmed with PCR) between 11 March and 20 May, 2020, were included. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Median age was 61 (range:18-94), and 752 (49%) were male. The most common types of cancers were breast (19.8%), prostate (10.9%), and colorectal cancer (10.8%). 65% of the patients had at least one comorbidity. At least one Covid-19 directed therapy was given in 73% of the patients.. Hospitalization rate of the patients was 56.6% and intensive care unit admission rate was 11.4%. 77 (5.1%) patients died within 30 days of diagnosis. The first multivariate model which included only the demographic and clinical characteristics showed older age, male gender, and presence of diabetes and receipt of cytotoxic therapy to be associated with increased 30-day mortality, while breast and prostate cancer diagnoses were associated with lower 30-day mortality. In the second set, we further included laboratory parameters. The presence of leukocytosis (OR 6.7, 95 % CI 3.3-13.7, p<0,001), lymphocytopenia (OR 3,1, 95 % CI 1,6-6,1, p=0,001) and thrombocytopenia (OR 3,4 95% CI 1,5-8,1, p=0,005) were found to be associated with increased 30-day mortality. Relatively lower mortality compared with Western countries and China mainly results from differences in baseline risk factors but may also implicate the importance of intensive supportive care.

Individual epidemiological studies have controlled for several confounders of the relationship between PTSD and increased dementia risk, yet particular risk factors underlying this relationship have not been determined. This systematic review protocol aims to identify risk and protective factors of dementia among adults with PTSD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct an electronic search of the databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, The Cochrane Library, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Global. After screening the studies, quantitative synthesis will be performed, if possible. Otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be performed. We will include randomised controlled trials and other types of research evidence including longitudinal cohort studies. Strength of evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations method. Examples of variables that will be extracted are: year of PTSD diagnosis, comorbid conditions, health behaviours, pharmacological treatments and year of mild cognitive impairment or dementia diagnosis. We developed this systematic review protocol according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 statement. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The proposed study will not collect individual-level data and, therefore, does not require ethical approval. Results of this study will provide current evidence on risk and protective factors of dementia in adults with PTSD.

With the spread of the disease, a better understanding of patient outcomes associated with their symptoms in diverse geographic levels is vital. We aimed to analysis clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients by disease symptoms in Ilam province of Iran. MethodsThis is a retrospective study. Data were collected from integrated health system records for all hospitals affiliated to Ilam University of Medical Sciences between 26 Jan 2020 and 02 May 2020. All patients with definite positive test were enrolled in this study. We used descriptive analyses, chi-square test and binary logistic regression to analyze the data using SPSS version 22. ResultsThe mean age was 46.47{+/-}18.24 years. Of 3608 patients, 3477 (96.1%) were discharged and 129 (3.9%) were died. 54.2% of the patients were male and were in the age group of 30-40 years old age. Cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing and fever or chills were the most common symptoms. People with symptoms of shortness of breath, abnormal radiographic findings of the chest, and chest pain and pressure were relatively more likely to die. Based on the findings of binary logistic regression probability of death in people who showed shortness of breath, abnormal chest radiographic findings and chest pain was 1.34, 1.24 and 1.32 times higher than those who did not show these symptoms, respectively.

755;Ambulatory Assessment Methods to Examine Momentary State-Based Predictors of Opioid Use Behaviors;10.1007/s40429-020-00351-7;"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Addiction scientists have begun using ambulatory assessment methods—including ecological momentary assessment (EMA), experience sampling, and daily diaries—to collect real-time or near-real-time reports of participants’ internal states in their natural environments. The goal of this short review is to synthesize EMA findings from our research group, which has studied several hundred outpatients during treatment for opioid-use disorder (OUD). (We cite pertinent findings from other groups, but have not tried to be comprehensive.) One of our main goals in using EMA is to examine momentary changes in internal states that proximally predict, or concurrently mark, events such as lapses to opioid use. RECENT FINDINGS: We summarize findings evaluating several classes of momentary markers or predictors (craving, stress, negative and positive moods, and physical pain/discomfort) of lapses and other states/behaviors. Craving and some negatively valenced mood states are concurrently and prospectively associated with lapses to opioid use during treatment. Craving is also concurrently and prospectively associated with momentary changes in stress and mood. Convincing evidence has not yet emerged for stress as a robust redictor of lapse to opioid use; it appears to be contributory, but neither necessary nor sufficient. SUMMARY: Ambulatory assessment can capture changes in internal states and drug-related behaviors in situ and at high temporal resolution. We recommend research strategies that may increase the clinical and prognostic utility of ambulatory assessment, including denser sampling (i.e., more assessments per day) and more attention to heterogeneity across people and across populations.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778403/;02/01/2021;opioid-use disorder;0.9663

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to understand gender differences in mental health outcomes in relation to the components of gendered working environments. METHODS The review followed a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search approach and focused on studies published in 2008-2018. The protocol for the review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019124066). FINDINGS Across the 27 cohort studies included in the review, we found that (1) there was inconclusive evidence on the effect of occupational gender composition on the mental health of men and women, (2) women's mental health was more likely to be affected by long working hours than men's; however, precarious employment was more likely to be negatively associated with men's mental health, (3) exposure to traditional constructs of psychosocial job stressors negatively affected the mental health of both women and men, and (4) unemployment and retirement are associated with poorer mental health in both genders. INTERPRETATION The findings from this review indicate that gendered working environments may affect the mental health of both men and women, but the association is dependent on the specific exposure examined.

758;Analysis of SIR-Network Model on COVID-19 with respect to its impact on West Bengal in India;10.1101/2020.08.05.20169037;The recent global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) disease has prompted many researchers to formulate lock-down and quarantine scenarios while the main concern of the researchers is to model the spread and the possible duration of the COVID-19 infections and also research on how long this is going to last. It seems that most of the researchers have recognized lock-down as one of the major impact factors in their models. As a result of this in the absence of lock-down the models formulated would not contribute much significant results. Hence, in this work we decide to formulate a mathematical model which would be able to predict the spread and also the possible duration of the pandemic, by considering both partial lock-down and the corresponding unlocking situations. Employing SIR-network models and taking the various districts of highly populated areas of West Bengal, India as the nodes or vertices we attempt to model the spread and duration of the pandemic during both partial lock-down and unlock phases but separately. We consider the populations where the locally present people and the people who have undergone migration of some shorts are well mixed together. In the network that we have provided the pointed edges refer to the migrating workers that is those that move away from their regular habitats in want of work. We use this research to study not only the trends that are associated with COVID-19 outbreaks, but also to study the impacts of the Government policies and the improvisation of medical facilities on this outbreak in West Bengal. At the end, we attempt to throw light upon the crisis that the economy of the state may have to go through separately on partial lock-down and unlocking scenarios.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.05.20169037v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.05.20169037";06/08/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9245

To date, there has not been any broad assessment of urological surgery residency changes and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Society of Academic Urologists distributed a questionnaire to urology residency program directors on March 30, 2020 exploring residency programs changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics are presented. A qualitative analysis of free response questions was undertaken. A post hoc analysis of differences related to local COVID-19 incidence is described. RESULTS The survey was distributed to 144 residency programs with 65 responses for a 45% response rate. Reserve staffing had started in 80% of programs. Patient-contact time had decreased significantly from 4.7 to 2.1 days per week (P<0.001). Redeployment was reported by 26% of programs. Sixty percent of programs reported concern that residents will not meet case minimums due to COVID-19. Wellness activities centered on increased communication. All programs had begun to use video-conferencing and the majority planned to continue using this. Programs in states with higher incidence of COVID-19 were more likely to report resident redeployment (48% vs 11%, P=0.002) and exposure to COVID-19-positive patients (70% vs 40%, P=0.03) and were less likely to report concerns regarding exposure (78% vs 97%, P=0.02) and personal protective equipment (PPE) availability (62% vs 89%, P=0.02).

760;Effectivity of a Program for the Control and Prevention of COVID-19 Healthcare-Associated Infections in a Spanish Academic Hospital.;10.1097/pts.0000000000000852;BACKGROUND Although recommendations to prevent COVID-19 healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) have been proposed, data on their effectivity are currently limited. OBJECTIVE The aim was to evaluate the effectivity of a program of control and prevention of COVID-19 in an academic general hospital in Spain. METHODS We captured the number of COVID-19 cases and the type of contact that occurred in hospitalized patients and healthcare personnel (HCP). To evaluate the impact of the continuous use of a surgical mask among HCP, the number of patients with COVID-19 HAIs and accumulated incidence of HCP with COVID-19 was compared between the preintervention and intervention periods. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-two patients with COVID-19 have been admitted to the hospital. Seven of them had an HAI origin (6 in the preintervention period and 1 in the intervention period). One hundred forty-two HCP were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Of them, 22 (15.5%) were attributed to healthcare (2 in the emergency department and none in the critical care departments), and 120 (84.5%) were attributed to social relations in the workplace or during their non-work-related personal interactions. The accumulated incidence during the preintervention period was 22.3 for every 1000 HCP and 8.2 for every 1000 HCP during the intervention period. The relative risk was 0.37 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.55) and the attributable risk was -0.014 (95% confidence interval, -0.020 to -0.009). CONCLUSIONS A program of control and prevention of HAIs complemented with the recommendation for the continuous use of a surgical mask in the workplace and social environments of HCP effectively decreased the risk of COVID-19 HAIs in admitted patients and HCP.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/pts.0000000000000852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34009878/";07/04/2021;healthcare-associated infections;0.924
761;Structural Motifs, Disorder, and the Efficacy of Viral Vaccines;10.1101/2020.06.08.139907;We demonstrate that it is possible to draw direct numerical correlations between virus particles and effective virus-like particle (VLP) derived vaccines through extraction of a Bragg-Williams order parameter from electron microscopy. The method has its roots in studies of disorder in metal alloys, and is adapted to describe the type and occurrence of structural motifs within the arrangement of viral coat proteins, captured by the value of the order parameter as a measure of disorder. A conventional approach to viral vaccine design consists of replicating select proteins to create a VLP designed to trigger an immune response while remaining non-infectious. Understanding variations between viruses and vaccine strains therefore tends to focus on differences between proteins, which can be characterized through genetic analysis. While such an approach provides vital information about the functioning and interactions of the proteins, it does not yet yield an early-stage pathway towards predicting the efficacy of a vaccine, and so large-scale clinical trials are required to obtain critical information. With the urgency associated with pandemics, including Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) originating from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is a need for earlier indications of whether a vaccine has the necessary characteristics. Application of the methodology to Dengue and influenza virus particles indicates that temperature and pH during incubation could potentially be exploited to fine-tune the order parameter of VLP-based vaccines to match the corresponding virus. Additionally, utilization of an Ising model plot reveals a clear relationship between case fatality rate and order parameter for distinct virus families.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.139907;08/06/2020;Coronavirus Disease-2019;0.9322
762;Factors Associated with Disease Severity and Mortality among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis;10.1101/2020.08.07.20166868;"Background: Understanding the factors associated with disease severity and mortality in Coronavirus disease (COVID19) is imperative to effectively triage patients. We performed a systematic review to determine the demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological factors associated with severity and mortality in COVID-19. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and WHO database for English language articles from inception until May 8, 2020. We included Observational studies with direct comparison of clinical characteristics between a) patients who died and those who survived or b) patients with severe disease and those without severe disease. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two authors independently. Results: Among 15680 articles from the literature search, 109 articles were included in the analysis. The risk of mortality was higher in patients with increasing age, male gender (RR 1.45; 95%CI 1.23,1.71), dyspnea (RR 2.55; 95%CI 1.88,2.46), diabetes (RR 1.59; 95%CI 1.41,1.78), hypertension (RR 1.90; 95%CI 1.69,2.15). Congestive heart failure (OR 4.76; 95%CI 1.34,16.97), hilar lymphadenopathy (OR 8.34; 95%CI 2.57,27.08), bilateral lung involvement (OR 4.86; 95%CI 3.19,7.39) and reticular pattern (OR 5.54; 95%CI 1.24,24.67) were associated with severe disease. Clinically relevant cut-offs for leukocytosis(>10.0 x109/L), lymphopenia(< 1.1 x109/L), elevated C-reactive protein(>100mg/L), LDH(>250U/L) and D-dimer(>1mg/L) had higher odds of severe disease and greater risk of mortality.

763;Detection profile of SARS‐CoV‐2 using RT‐PCR in different types of clinical specimens: A systematic review and meta‐analysis;10.1002/jmv.26349;"Testing is one of the commendable measures for curbing the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19). But, it should be done using the most appropriate specimen and an accurate diagnostic test such as real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR). Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to determine the positive detection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) in different clinical specimens using qRT‐PCR. A total of 8136 pooled clinical specimens were analyzed to detect SARS‐CoV‐2, the majority were nasopharyngeal swabs (69.6%). A lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens had a positive rate (PR) of 71.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 60.3%‐82.3%) while no virus was detected in the urinogenital specimens. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLF) specimen had the PR of 91.8% (95% CI: 79.9%‐103.7%), followed by rectal swabs; 87.8% (95% CI: 78.6%‐96.9%) then sputum; 68.1% (95% CI: 56.9%‐79.4%). A low PR was observed in oropharyngeal swabs; 7.6% (95% CI: 5.7%‐9.6%) and blood samples; 1.0% (95% CI: −0.1%‐2.1%) whereas no SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in urine samples. Feces had a PR of 32.8% (95% CI:1 5.8%‐49.8%). Nasopharyngeal swab, a widely used specimen had a PR of 45.5% (95% CI: 31.2%‐59.7%). In this study, SARS‐CoV‐2 was highly detected in LRT specimens while no virus was detected in urinogenital specimens. BLF had the highest PR followed by rectal swab then sputum. Nasopharyngeal swab which is widely used had moderate PR. Low PR was recorded in oropharyngeal swab and blood samples while no virus was found in urine samples.

764;Initial Report From a Swedish High-Volume Transplant Center After The First Wave of The COVID-19 Pandemic.;10.1097/tp.0000000000003436;BACKGROUND Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients may be more vulnerable to COVID-19. Data on the clinical course of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients are limited, and the optimal management strategy for these patients is yet unclear. METHODS We present 53 SOT recipients (31 kidney, 8 liver, 5 heart, 5 lung, 3 liver-kidney and one kidney-after-heart), transplanted at a Swedish high-volume transplant center and each diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 21, 2020, and June 22, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were extracted from the electronic patient files. RESULTS Patients reported fever (61%), cough (43%), diarrhea (31%), and upper respiratory symptoms (29%). The median age was 56 years, and 57% were male. According to severity, 55% had mild, 13% had moderate, 19% had severe, and 13% had critical disease. Thirty-seven patients (70%) were hospitalized, with 8 requiring intensive care. Thirteen of the 37 patients were initially managed as outpatients but later hospitalized. One patient received hydroxychloroquine, and no patients received antivirals. Antimetabolites and calcineurin inhibitors were held or reduced in two thirds. Twenty-seven out of 37 hospitalized patients (73%) received low molecular weight heparin. Five (13,5%) hospitalized patients died. Overall survival for the entire cohort was 94%. No rejection episodes were noted. CONCLUSIONS Hospitalization, lowering of immunosuppression, and prophylactic anticoagulation were the most common therapeutic interventions for SOT recipients with COVID-19. A significant proportion of patients could be managed on an outpatient basis, while keeping a low threshold for admission. Mild and moderate disease forms seems to have good outcome.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32826796/";20/08/2020;Solid organ transplant;0.9209
765;Prenatal screening diagnosis and management in the era of coronavirus: the Sardinian experience.;10.1515/jpm-2020-0208;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new coronavirus, was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly, affecting many other countries. The disease is now referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The Italian government declared a state of emergency on 31st January 2020 and on 11th March World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. Although the COVID-19 incidence remained considerably lower in Sardinia than in the North Italy regions, which were the most affected, the field of prenatal screening and diagnosis was modified because of the emerging pandemic. Data on COVID-19 during pregnancy are so far limited. Since the beginning of the emergency, our Ob/Gyn Department at Microcitemico Hospital, Cagliari offered to pregnant patients all procedures considered essential by the Italian Ministry of Health. To evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the activities of our center, we compared the number of procedures performed from 10th March to 18th May 2020 with those of 2019. Despite the continuous local birth rate decline, during the 10-week pandemic period, we registered a 20% increment of 1st trimester combined screening and a slight rise of the number of invasive prenatal procedures with a further increase in chorionic villi sampling compared to amniocentesis. Noninvasive prenatal testing remained unvariated. The request for multifetal pregnancy reduction as a part of the growing tendency of voluntary termination of pregnancy in Sardinia increased. The COVID-19 pandemic provides many scientific opportunities for clinical research and study of psychological and ethical issues in pregnant women.;"https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32628637/";07/07/2020;coronavirus disease 2019;0.9232
766;The far side of the COVID-19 epidemic curve: local re-openings based on globally coordinated triggers may work best;10.1101/2020.05.10.20097485;In the late stages of an epidemic, infections are often sporadic and geographically distributed. Spatially structured stochastic models can capture these important features of disease dynamics, thereby allowing a broader exploration of interventions. Here we develop a stochastic model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission amongst an interconnected group of population centres representing counties, municipalities and districts (collectively, ``counties''). The model is parameterized with demographic, epidemiological, testing, and travel data from the province of Ontario, Canada. We explore the effects of different control strategies after the epidemic curve has been flattened. We compare a local strategy of re-opening (and re-closing, as needed) schools and workplaces county-by-county according to triggers for county-specific infection prevalence, to a global strategy of province-wide re-opening and re-closing according to triggers for province-wide infection prevalence. We find that the local strategy results in far fewer person-days of closure but only slightly more coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases, even under assumptions of high inter-county travel. However, both cases and person-days lost to closure rise significantly when county triggers are not coordinated by the province and when testing rates vary among counties. Finally, we show that local strategies can also do better in the early epidemic stage but only if testing rates are high and the trigger prevalence is low. Our results suggest that phased plans for re-opening economies on the far side of the COVID-19 epidemic curve should consider preceding larger-scale re-openings with coordinated local re-openings.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.10.20097485v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097485";14/05/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9038
767;Elevated HbA1c levels in pre‐Covid‐19 infection increases the risk of mortality: A sistematic review and meta‐analysis;10.1002/dmrr.3476;"AIMS: Diabetes is emerging as a risk factor for coronavirus disease (COVID)‐19 prognosis. However, contradictory findings have been reported regarding the impact of glycaemic control on COVID‐19 outcome. The aim of this meta‐analysis was to explore the impact of hospital pre‐admission or at‐admission values of HbA1c on COVID‐19 mortality or worsening in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus up to 30th December 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selection were the following: (1)enrolling patients with any form of diabetes mellitus and hospitalized for COVID‐19 and (2) reporting data regarding HbA1c values before infection or at hospital admission in relation to COVID‐19 mortality or worsening. Descriptive statistics, HbA1c values, odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios were extracted from seven observational studies and generic inverse variance (random effects) of OR was used to estimate the effect of HbA1c on COVID‐19 outcome. RESULTS: HbA1c was linearly associated with an increased COVID‐19 mortality or worsening when considered as a continuous variable (OR 1.01 [1.01, 1.01]; p < 0.00001). Similarly, when analysing studies providing the number of events according to the degree of glycaemic control among various strata, a significantly increased risk was observed with poor glycaemic control (OR 1.15 [1.11, 1.19]; p < 0.00001), a result corroborated by sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the large heterogeneity in study design and patients' characteristics in the few available studies, data suggest that patients with diabetes and poor glycaemic control before infection might have an increased risk of COVID‐19 related mortality.";"https://doi.org/10.1002/dmrr.3476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34018307/";28/05/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9875
768;Phytochemicals as Antiviral Agents: Recent Updates;10.1007/978-981-15-1761-7_12;The epidemic of viral diseases is a global concern, mandating an urgent need of most promising antivirals. Some of the viral diseases can be cured by approved antiviral drugs, but for others still do not have any vaccines or drugs available. Most of the approved antiviral drugs are somehow directly or indirectly associated with side effects, which eventually raise the need for the development of antivirals based on natural phytochemicals. Globally, the development of antivirals is shifting towards the plant-derived products as they are less toxic and has less chance to develop resistance. Phytochemicals have been exploited traditionally for the cure of many diseases, and also have been reported to inhibit viral replication/transcription. Most of them inhibit the viruses either during the viral entry inside the host cell or during their replication. Moreover, 50% of the drugs derived from plants are being used in the Western nations. Plants have a variety of phytochemicals like flavonoids, terpenoids, lignins, alkaloids, and coumarins that are having antioxidant activity, and help to inhibit viral genome. Various plant-derived products have been well studied against viruses like herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, and hepatitis virus. More recently, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a newly identified coronavirus has become pandemic, and affected world’s population severely. However, there are still less explored phytochemicals for the inhibition of viruses like dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and other alphaviruses. In this chapter, we will emphasize on the reported phytochemicals and their derivatives, having antiviral properties and their mechanism to treat viral diseases.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211506/;12/05/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9734
769;MORTALITY REVIEW FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN SNOW LEOPARD (PANTHERA UNCIA) ZOO POPULATION FROM JANUARY 1999 TO DECEMBER 2019.;10.1638/2020-0132;The objective of this 20-yr retrospective study was to review and summarize causes of mortality in the North American (NA) snow leopard population to inform and enhance animal health and husbandry practices. Pathology reports were requested from all NA zoological institutions housing snow leopards that died between 01 January 1999 and 31 December 2019. Data were reviewed and cause of death (COD) and concurrent diseases were summarized and compared by age group, organ system, and disease process. The 241 snow leopards in this report include 109 males, 130 females, and two of undetermined sex. Among them were 116 geriatric snow leopards (>15 yr), 72 adults (15-3 yr), 16 juveniles (3 yr to 2 mo), 32 neonates (2 mo to 0 days), and five fetuses (<0 days). Overall, noninfectious diseases were the most common COD across all age groups (73%). In adult and geriatric snow leopards, chronic renal disease (CRD) (38.8%) and malignant neoplasia (19.7%), including oral squamous cell carcinoma (6.4%), were a common COD. In juveniles and neonates, perinatal death and congenital diseases, including ocular coloboma (15.6%), were a common COD. Individuals with CRD were 13.5 and 4.36 times more likely to have veno-occlusive disease and cardiac fibrosis, respectively. Snow leopards with urolithiasis were 5.27 times more likely to have CRD. Infectious (14.1%) and inflammatory diseases (8.7%) for which no specific etiology was identified were less common overall and more common in juveniles and neonates (25% and 21%, respectively). Neoplasms not previously reported in snow leopards or that are generally uncommon in the veterinary literature included transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (n = 7) and mesothelioma (n = 1).;"https://doi.org/10.1638/2020-0132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827171/";01/04/2021;cause of death;0.9758
770;A Report on the Use of Telehealth in Otolaryngology: In the Pre COVID-19 Era.;10.1089/tmj.2021.0049;"Objective: To investigate the integration of and barriers to the utilization of telehealth technology and its components (telemedicine, e-Health, m-health) in daily otolaryngologic practice before the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary academic center. A national survey of members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery was administered. Descriptive analyses were performed to determine how telehealth was employed in otolaryngologists' practices. Results: A total of 184 surveys were completed. Telehealth technology was used by 50% of otolaryngologists surveyed. Regions with the largest percentage of physicians using telehealth were the Mid-Atlantic region (84%) and West Coast (67%). Most otolaryngologists indicated that they were familiar with telehealth or any of its components and how it is used in practice (52-83%), they had heard of telehealth or any of its components but were unsure what the terms specifically entailed (17-42%); 53% were satisfied with their current use of telehealth and electronic medical record (EMR); and 72% were comfortable utilizing smart devices for patient care. Most otolaryngologists (65%) indicated reimbursement as the biggest limitation to implementing telehealth, and 67% believed that typing was a hindrance to EMR utility. Conclusion: Half of the surveyed otolaryngologists used some form of telehealth at the time of the survey. The most commonly cited obstacle to physician adoption of telehealth was reimbursement. Although the adoption of telehealth technology was still limited in the field of otolaryngology based on this study, we are now seeing significant change due to the COVID-19 pandemic.";"https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028286/";21/05/2021;SARS CoV-2;0.9711
771;The respiratory sound features of COVID-19 patients fill gaps between clinical data and screening methods;10.1101/2020.04.07.20051060;Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has continuous outbreaks around the world. Lung is the main organ that be involved. There is a lack of clinical data on the respiratory sounds of COVID-19 infected pneumonia, which includes invaluable information concerning physiology and pathology. The medical resources are insufficient, which are now mainly supplied for the severe patients. The development of a convenient and effective screening method for mild or asymptomatic suspicious patients is highly demanded. Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. 10 patients with positive results of nucleic acid were enrolled in this study. Lung auscultation was performed by the same physician on admission using a hand-held portable electronic stethoscope delivered in real time via Bluetooth. The recorded audio was exported, and was analyzed by six physicians. Each physician individually described the abnormal breathing sounds that he heard. The results were analyzed in combination with clinical data. Signal analysis was used to quantitatively describe the most common abnormal respiratory sounds. Results: All patients were found abnormal breath sounds at least by 3 physicians, and one patient by all physicians. Cackles, asymmetrical vocal resonance and indistinguishable murmurs are the most common abnormal breath sounds. One asymptomatic patient was found vocal resonance, and the result was correspondence with radiographic computed tomography. Signal analysis verified the credibility of the above abnormal breath sounds. Conclusions: This study describes respiratory sounds of patients with COVID-19, which fills up for the lack of clinical data and provides a simple screening method for suspected patients.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20051060;10/04/2020;coronavirus;0.9694
772;COVID‐19 associated with severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia;10.1111/trf.16226;"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) has many known disease associations, including autoimmune, lymphoproliferative, and certain infectious diseases, as well as various medications. Studies have found that severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) may be associated with coagulopathies; however, the potential association with AIHA is not clear. CASE REPORT: A patient with no known risk factors or underlying predisposition for developing AIHA presented to a hospital with vague symptoms and profound anemia with a complicated blood bank evaluation. She was found to have COVID‐19 and AIHA, for which extensive laboratory testing was performed, including direct antiglobulin tests, elution studies, and cold agglutinin titers, to identify the causative autoantibody. She required multiple blood transfusions and therapeutic interventions before clinical stabilization. DISCUSSION: AIHA is a complex disease with a spectrum of presentations and clinical severity. Many diseases have been associated with a propensity for developing AIHA; however, there are few cases in the literature of patients with COVID‐19 and AIHA. Most of the reports involve patients with other underlying conditions that are known to be associated with the development of AIHA. The presentation, clinical findings, and therapeutic interventions in a patient with severe AIHA, without other underlying conditions, in the setting of COVID‐19 are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: There are few reports of patients with concurrent COVID‐19 and AIHA, and the association is not clear. Although COVID‐19 has been shown to be associated with coagulopathies, more research is required to determine whether AIHA may also be a potential complication.";"https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274459/";16/12/2020;Autoimmune hemolytic anemia;0.9298
773;Clinical significance of olfactory dysfunction in patients of COVID-19.;10.1097/jcma.0000000000000560;BACKGROUND Currently, as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, rapidly obtaining accurate information of patient symptoms and their progression is crucial and vital. Although the early studies in China have illustrated that the representative symptoms of COVID-19 include (dry) cough, fever, headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal discomfort, dyspnea, and muscle pain, there is increasing evidence to suggest that olfactory and taste disorder are related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we conduct this study to review the present literature about the correlation between anosmia or dysgeusia and COVID-19. METHODS A comprehensive literature search in 2020 of the electronic journal databases, mainly PubMed or Web of Science, was performed using the key words COVID-19 or respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with hyposmia, anosmia, dysgeusia, olfactory disorder or olfactory dysfunction. The country, study period, case number, inpatient or outpatient medical visit, evaluation method (subjective complaints of dysfunction or objective evaluation), and occurrence rate of olfactory or gustatory function were reviewed. RESULTS Many studies reported that the recoverable olfactory or gustatory dysfunction may play an important role as the early clinical symptom of COVID-19. It is associated with better prognosis, although further investigation and validation should be carried out. CONCLUSION Studies have shown that smell and taste disturbances may represent an early symptom of COVID-19 and healthcare professionals must be very vigilant when managing patients with these symptoms. In the pandemic era, this implies testing for COVID-19 by healthcare workers with full personal protective equipment.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34074933/";01/06/2021;coronavirus disease;0.916
774;Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (previously 2019-nCoV) by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion;10.1101/2020.03.09.983247;The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we herein used a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potently inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging SARSr-CoVs.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.983247;12/03/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9871
775;A risk score based on procalcitonin for predicting acute kidney injury in COVID‐19 patients;10.1002/jcla.23805;BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported developing commonly in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients and could increase the risk of poor outcomes in these patients. We design this study to explore the value of serum procalcitonin (PCT) on predicting AKI and construct risk score for predicting AKI in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 and hospitalized in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between January 30 and February 24, 2020, were included. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was performed to identify the strongest predictors of AKI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to find independent risk factors for AKI and construct risk score using odds ratio (OR) value of those risk factors. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were plotted, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) value was calculated to evaluate the predictive value of single PCT level and the constructed risk score. RESULTS: Among 389 included COVID‐19 patients, 28 (7.2%) patients developed AKI. LASSO regression showed hypertension, saturation of arterial oxygen (SaO(2)), PCT, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were the strongest predictors for AKI. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, only SaO(2) (<0.001), PCT (p = 0.004), and BUN (p = 0.005) were independently associated with development of AKI in COVID‐19 patients. The AUC of single PCT and constructed risk score was 0. 881 and 0.928, respectively. CONCLUSION: PCT level is correlated with AKI in COVID‐19 patients. The efficient risk score consisted of SaO(2), PCT, and BUN is readily accessible for physicians to evaluate the possibility of AKI in COVID‐19 patients.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34032326/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23805";25/05/2021;Acute kidney injury;0.9125
776;Increasing both specificity and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests by using an adaptive orthogonal testing approach;10.1101/2020.11.05.20226449;Background SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests have undergone a remarkable improvement in performance. However, due to the low seroprevalence in several areas, very high demands are made on their specificity. Furthermore, the low antibody-response in some individuals requires high test sensitivity to avoid underestimating true seroprevalence. Optimization of testing has been reported through lowering manufacturer cut-offs to improve SARS-CoV-2 assay sensitivity or by combining two tests to improve specificity at the cost of sensitivity. However, these strategies have thus far been used in isolation of each other. Methods To increase sensitivity, cut-offs of three commercially available SARS-CoV-2 automated assays (Roche, Abbott, and DiaSorin) were reduced according to published values in a pre-pandemic specificity cohort (n=1117) and a SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort (n=64). All three testing systems were combined in an orthogonal approach with a confirmatory test, which was one of the remaining automated assays or one of two commercial ELISAs directed against the spike protein receptor binding-domain (RBD) or the nucleocapsid antigen (NP). Results The modified orthogonal test strategy resulted in an improved specificity of at least 99.8%, often even 100%, in all 12 tested combinations with no significant decline in sensitivity. In our cohort, regardless of whether the assays were used for screening or confirmation, combining Roche and Abbott delivered the best overall performance (+~10% sensitivity compared to the single tests and 100% specificity). Conclusion Here we propose a novel orthogonal assay strategy that approaches 100% specificity while maintaining or even significantly improving the screening test's sensitivity.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.20226449; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.05.20226449v1?rss=1";07/11/2020;binding-domain;0.9627
777;Assessment of Stress, Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms in Patients with COPD during In-Hospital Pulmonary Rehabilitation: An Observational Cohort Study;10.3390/medicina57030197;Background and Objectives: The relationship between physical health and mental health has been considered for years. A number of studies have shown a correlation between depressive states and the progress of somatic diseases. It seems that the proper cooperation of specialists may result in the improvement of the patient’s well-being and a positive effect on the course of the rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to assess the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as the assessment of the relationship of psychological symptoms with sociodemographic factors and physical condition. Materials and Methods: The study enrolled 51 COPD patients who underwent a three-week pulmonary rehabilitation program. After admission to the rehabilitation department, the subjects were asked to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, the Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Results: Anxiety states were diagnosed in 70% of respondents and depressive states were diagnosed in 54% of patients. Some of the respondents (14%) also showed a tendency to experience various grounded stresses. Additionally, there were correlations between the mental state and the results of fitness and respiratory tests. Conclusions: Patients with COPD are at risk for mental disorders, which may adversely affect their general health and significantly limit their physical and respiratory efficiencies. The development of widely available therapeutic solutions to reduce symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, and stress seems to be an important challenge for the management of patients with COPD.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996584/;25/02/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.965
778;SARS-CoV-2 Spread Dynamics in Italy: The Calabria Experience.;10.2174/1574887116666210401124945;INTRODUCTION The first case of infection by SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., COVID-19) has been officially recorded by the Italian National Health Service on February 21st, 2020. Lombardy was the first Italian region to be affected by the pandemic. Subsequently, the entire Northern part of Italy recorded a high number of cases, while the South was hit following the migratory waves. On March 8th, the Italian Government has issued a decree that imposed a total lockdown defined as a state of isolation and restricted access in Lombardy and in the other 14 provinces of Northern Italy. METHODS We analyzed the virus trend in the period between February 24th and September 8th, 2020, focusing on Calabria, with regards to the following items: new positives, change of total positives and total cases. Furthermore, we included other information, such as the incubation period, symptom resolution period, quarantine period. RESULTS On March 27th, the epidemic curve spiked with 101 new positive cases validating the hypothesis that this abnormal event was related to the displacement of non-residents people, living in the Northern part of Italy, to the home regions in the South. The epidemic curve showed a decreasing trend in the period after lockdown proving the effectiveness of this measure. From the end of the lockdown (May 04th) to September 8th, the registered trend was -94.51%. A negative growth rate indicates that the number of new positive cases is lower than the number of healed patients. CONCLUSION This study describes the effectiveness of the Italian Government policy, particularly the role of lockdown, for the containment of SARS-CoV-2 contagion in Calabria, a region with a low SARS-CoV-2 infection rate within the registered period.;"https://doi.org/10.2174/1574887116666210401124945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797377/";01/04/2021;SARS-CoV-2;0.976
779;Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: considerations for the biomedical waste sector in India;10.1016/j.cscee.2020.100029;Abstract In late December 2019, the world woke to a truth of a pandemic of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), inspired by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has a place with a gathering of beta-coronavirus. As of July 21 India is still fighting to survive against the SARS-CoV-2 as called coronavirus disease. The contaminations, first constrained in the Kerala state, have inevitably spread to every single other area. The possibility to cause dangerous respiratory disappointment and quick transmission puts COVID-19 in the rundown of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There is a flow overall break out of the novel coronavirus Covid-19, which started from Wuhan in China and has now spread to more than 212 countries including 14,753,034 cases, as of 12:20 AM on July 21, 2020. Governments are feeling the squeeze to prevent the outbreak from spiralling into a worldwide wellbeing crisis. At this stage, readiness, straightforwardness, and sharing of data are vital to hazard evaluations and starting explosion control exercises. Since the episode of serious intense respiratory disorder (SARS) 18 years back, an enormous number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been found in their regular repository have, bats. During this epidemic condition, expulsion of biomedical waste created from crisis facilities treating COVID-19 patients in like manner demands unprecedented thought as they can be potential bearers of the disease SARS-CoV-2. This article discusses the potential consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on biomedical waste administrations, concentrating on basic focuses where option working methodology or extra moderation measures might be fitting.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266601642030027X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S266601642030027X";01/08/2020;Coronavirus Disease;0.9764
780;Neuroimaging Findings of Hospitalized Covid-19 Patients: A Canadian Retrospective Observational Study.;10.1177/08465371211002815;PURPOSE Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been associated with neurologic sequelae and neuroimaging abnormalities in several case series previously. In this study, the neuroimaging findings and clinical course of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to a tertiary care hospital network in Canada were characterized. METHODS This is a retrospective observational study conducted at a tertiary hospital network in Ontario, Canada. All adult patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted from February 1, 2020 to July 22, 2020 who received neuroimaging related to their COVID-19 admission were included. CT and MR images were reviewed and categorized by fellowship-trained neuroradiologists. Demographic and clinical data were collected and correlated with imaging findings. RESULTS We identified 422 patients admitted with COVID-19 during the study period. 103 (24.4%) met the inclusion criteria and were included: 30 ICU patients (29.1%) and 73 non-ICU patients (70.9%). A total of 198 neuroimaging studies were performed: 177 CTs and 21 MRIs. 17 out of 103 imaged patients (16.8%) had acute abnormalities on neuroimaging: 10 had macrohemorrhages (58.8%), 9 had acute ischemia (52.9%), 4 had SWI abnormalities (23.5%), and 1 had asymmetric sulcal effacement suggesting possible focal encephalitis (5.8%). ICU patients were more likely to have positive neuroimaging findings, more specifically acute ischemia and macrohemorrhages (P < 0.05). Macrohemorrhages were associated with increased mortality (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Macrohemorrhages, acute ischemia and SWI abnormalities were the main neuroimaging abnormalities in our cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Acute ischemia and hemorrhage were associated with worse clinical status.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/08465371211002815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33881958/";21/04/2021;PURPOSE Coronavirus disease;0.9841
781;The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic;10.1101/2020.03.22.20040642;Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations. Here, we compile new data on 1,659 local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 42% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies collectively have had significant effects slowing this growth. Our results suggest that similar policies may have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large, beneficial, and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that, to date, current policies have already prevented or delayed on the order of 62 million infections across these six countries. These findings may help inform whether or when these ongoing policies should be lifted or intensified, and they can support decision-making in the other 180+ countries where COVID-19 has been reported.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040642;27/03/2020;coronavirus;0.9667
782;The polybasic insert, the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the feline coronavirus – evolved or yet to evolve;10.1016/j.bbrep.2021.100907;"Recent research on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has exploded around the furin-cleavable polybasic insert PRRAR↓S, found within the spike protein. The insert and the receptor-binding domain, (RBD), are vital clues in the Sherlock Holmes-like investigation into the origin of the virus and in its zoonotic crossover. Based on comparative analysis of the whole genome and the sequence features of the insert and the RBD domain, the bat and the pangolin have been proposed as very likely intermediary hosts. In this study, using the various databases, in-house developed tools, sequence comparisons, structure-guided docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, we cautiously present a fresh, theoretical perspective on the SARS-CoV-2 virus activation and its intermediary host. They are a) the SARS-CoV-2 has not yet acquired a fully optimal furin binding site or this seemingly less optimal sequence, PRRARS, has been selected for survival; b) in structural models of furin complexed with peptides, PRRAR↓S binds less well and with distinct differences as compared to the all basic RRKRR↓S; c) these differences may be exploited for the design of virus-specific inhibitors; d) the novel polybasic insert of SARS-CoV-2 may be promiscuous enough to be cleaved by multiple enzymes of the human airway epithelium and tissues which may explain its unexpected broad tropism; e) the RBD domain of the feline coronavirus spike protein carries residues that are responsible for high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE 2 receptor; f) en route zoonotic transfer, the virus may have passed through the domestic cat whose very human-like ACE2 receptor and furin may have played some role in optimizing the traits required for zoonotic transfer.";"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405580821000017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrep.2021.100907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521335/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405580821000017?v=s5";13/01/2021;receptor-binding domain;0.9369
783;Optimal mean airway pressure during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in an experimental model of acute respiratory distress syndrome: EIT-based method;10.1186/s13613-020-0647-z;BACKGROUND: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) may theoretically provide lung protective ventilation. The negative clinical results may be due to inadequate mean airway pressure (mPaw) settings in HFOV. Our objective was to evaluate the air distribution, ventilatory and hemodynamic effects of individual mPaw titration during HFOV in ARDS animal based on oxygenation and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). METHODS: ARDS was introduced with repeated bronchoalveolar lavage followed by injurious mechanical ventilation in ten healthy male pigs (51.2 ± 1.9 kg). Settings of HFOV were 9 Hz (respiratory frequency), 33% (inspiratory time) and 70 cmH(2)O (∆pressure). After lung recruitment, the mPaw was reduced in steps of 3 cmH(2)O every 6 min. Hemodynamics and blood gases were obtained in each step. Regional ventilation distribution was determined with EIT. RESULTS: PaO(2)/FiO(2) decreased significantly during the mPaw decremental phase (p < 0.001). Lung overdistended regions decreased, while recruitable regions increased as mPaw decreased. The optimal mPaw with respect to PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 21 (18.0–21.0) cmH(2)O, that is comparable to EIT-based center of ventilation (EIT-CoV) and EIT-collapse/over, 19.5 (15.0–21.0) and 19.5 (18.0–21.8), respectively (p = 0.07). EIT-CoV decreasing along with mPaw decrease revealed redistribution toward non-dependent regions. The individual mPaw titrated by EIT-based indices improved regional ventilation distribution with respect to overdistension and collapse (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Our data suggested personalized optimal mPaw titration by EIT-based indices improves regional ventilation distribution and lung homogeneity during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7060304/;06/03/2020;High-frequency oscillatory ventilation;0.9686
784;Automated measurement of hip–knee–ankle angle on the unilateral lower limb X-rays using deep learning;10.1007/s13246-020-00951-7;Significant inherent extra-articular varus angulation is associated with abnormal postoperative hip–knee–ankle (HKA) angle. At present, HKA is manually measured by orthopedic surgeons and it increases the doctors’ workload. To automatically determine HKA, a deep learning-based automated method for measuring HKA on the unilateral lower limb X-rays was developed and validated. This study retrospectively selected 398 double lower limbs X-rays during 2018 and 2020 from Jilin University Second Hospital. The images (n = 398) were cropped into unilateral lower limb images (n = 796). The deep neural network was used to segment the head of hip, the knee, and the ankle in the same image, respectively. Then, the mean square error of distance between each internal point of each organ and the organ’s boundary was calculated. The point with the minimum mean square error was set as the central point of the organ. HKA was determined using the coordinates of three organs’ central points according to the law of cosines. In a quantitative analysis, HKA was measured manually by three orthopedic surgeons with a high consistency (176.90 ° ± 12.18°, 176.95 ° ± 12.23°, 176.87 ° ± 12.25°) as evidenced by the Kandall’s W of 0.999 (p < 0.001). Of note, the average measured HKA by them (176.90 ° ± 12.22°) served as the ground truth. The automatically measured HKA by the proposed method (176.41 ° ± 12.08°) was close to the ground truth, showing no significant difference. In addition, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between them is 0.999 (p < 0.001). The average of difference between prediction and ground truth is 0.49°. The proposed method indicates a high feasibility and reliability in clinical practice.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13246-020-00951-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252719/";30/11/2020;consistency;0.9428

However, scant information is available regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and ocular structures tropism. We conducted a systematic review of articles referenced in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR) from December 20, 2019 to April 6, 2020, providing information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal sac, and tears. We excluded ongoing clinical studies as for unobtainable conclusive results. Of 2422 articles, 11 met the inclusion criteria for analysis and were included in the study. None of the studies were multinational. Among the 11 selected papers there were three original articles, one review, four letters, two editorials, and one correspondence letter. Globally, 252 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were included in our review. The prevalence of ocular conjunctivitis complicating the course of COVID-19 was demonstrated to be as high as 32% in one study only. Globally, three patients had conjunctivitis with a positive tear-PCR, 8 patients had positive tear-PCR in the absence of conjunctivitis, and 14 had conjunctivitis with negative tear-PCR. The majority of the available data regarding SARS-CoV-2 colonization of ocular and periocular tissues and secretions have to be considered controversial. However, it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 could both infect the eye and the surrounding structures. SARS-CoV-2 may use ocular structure as an additional transmission route, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 patients' conjunctival secretion and tears positivity to reverse transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV-2-RNA assay.;"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-0926-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425362/";18/05/2020;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9888

Virus Watch aims to provide evidence on which public health approaches are most likely to be effective in reducing transmission and impact of the virus, and will investigate community incidence, symptom profiles and transmission of COVID-19 in relation to population movement and behaviours. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Virus Watch is a household community cohort study of acute respiratory infections in England and Wales and will run from June 2020 to August 2021. The study aims to recruit 50 000 people, including 12 500 from minority ethnic backgrounds, for an online survey cohort and monthly antibody testing using home fingerprick test kits. Nested within this larger study will be a subcohort of 10 000 individuals, including 3000 people from minority ethnic backgrounds. This cohort of 10 000 people will have full blood serology taken between October 2020 and January 2021 and repeat serology between May 2021 and August 2021. Participants will also post self-administered nasal swabs for PCR assays of SARS-CoV-2 and will follow one of three different PCR testing schedules based on symptoms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study has been approved by the Hampstead National Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority Ethics Committee (ethics approval number 20/HRA/2320). We are monitoring participant queries and using these to refine methodology where necessary, and are providing summaries and policy briefings of our preliminary findings to inform public health action by working through our partnerships with our study advisory group, Public Health England, NHS and government scientific advisory panels.;"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162651/";23/06/2021;coronavirus;0.973
787;Prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among Health Care Workers—Zambia, July 2020;10.1093/cid/ciab273;INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers (HCWs) in Zambia have become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs is not known in Zambia. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey among Zambian HCWs in twenty health facilities in six districts in July 2020. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for health facility clustering, were calculated for each test separately and a combined measure for those who had PCR and ELISA performed. RESULTS: In total, 660 HCWs participated in the study, with 450 (68.2%) providing nasopharyngeal swab for PCR and 575 (87.1%) providing a blood specimen for ELISA. Sixty-six percent of participants were females and the median age was 31.5 years (interquartile range 26.2–39.8 years). The overall prevalence of the combined measure was 9.3% (95% CI 3.8%–14.7%). PCR-positive prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.6% (95% CI 2.0%–11.1%) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 2.2% (95% CI 0.5%–3.9%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs was similar to a population-based estimate (10.6%) during a period of community transmission in Zambia. Public health measures such as establishing COVID-19 treatment centers before the first cases, screening for COVID-19 symptoms among patients accessing health facilities, infection prevention and control trainings, and targeted distribution of personal protective equipment based on exposure risk might have prevented increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission among Zambian HCWs.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784382/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab273";30/03/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9865
788;Clinical correlations of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with COVID-19 infection;10.1101/2020.10.22.20213207;Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding the clinical correlations of antibodies produced by infected individuals will be critical for incorporating antibody results into clinical management. This study was an observational cohort study to evaluate antibody responses in individuals with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, including 48 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at a large tertiary care medical center. Serum samples were obtained from patients at various time points during the disease course and tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Medical records were reviewed, and antibody levels were compared with clinical and laboratory findings. Patients did not have high levels of antibodies within one week of symptoms, but most had detectable IgM and IgG antibodies between 8 and 29 days after onset of symptoms. Some individuals did not develop measurable levels of IgM or IgG antibodies. IgM antibodies were associated with elevated ALT, but there were no other significant associations. We did not observe significant associations of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with clinical outcomes, including intubation and death. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were unlikely to be detected in the first week of infection or in severely immunocompromised individuals. Although we did not observe associations with clinical outcomes, IgM antibodies were associated with higher ALT levels. Antibody production reflects the virus-specific immune response, which is important for immunity but also drives pathology, and antibody levels may be important for guiding treatment of individuals with COVID-19.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20213207v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.22.20213207";23/10/2020;Coronavirus disease 19;0.9901
789;Trends in Indicators of Injection Drug Use, Indian Health Service, 2010-2014: A Study of Health Care Encounter Data.;10.1177/0033354920937284;OBJECTIVES Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV transmission in the United States may increase as a result of increasing rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) and associated injection drug use (IDU). Epidemiologic trends among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons are not well known. METHODS We analyzed 2010-2014 Indian Health Service data on health care encounters to assess regional and temporal trends in IDU indicators among adults aged ≥18 years. IDU indicators included acute or chronic HCV infection (only among adults aged 18-35 years), arm cellulitis and abscess, OUD, and opioid-related overdose. We calculated rates per 10 000 AI/AN adults for each IDU indicator overall and stratified by sex, age group, and region and evaluated rate ratios and trends by using Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS Rates of HCV infection among adults aged 18-35 increased 9.4% per year, and rates of OUD among all adults increased 13.3% per year from 2010 to 2014. The rate of HCV infection among young women was approximately 1.3 times that among young men. Rates of opioid-related overdose among adults aged <50 years were approximately 1.4 times the rates among adults aged ≥50 years. Among young adults with HCV infection, 25.6% had concurrent OUD. Among all adults with arm cellulitis and abscess, 5.6% had concurrent OUD. CONCLUSIONS Rates of HCV infection and OUD increased significantly in the AI/AN population. Strengthened public health efforts could ensure that AI/AN communities can address increasing needs for culturally appropriate interventions, including comprehensive syringe services programs, medication-assisted treatment, and opioid-related overdose prevention and can meet the growing need for treatment of HCV infection.;"https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354920937284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633599/";07/07/2020;Hepatitis C virus;0.9706
790;Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID‐19 in patients with type 2 diabetes in Turkey: A nationwide study (TurCoviDia);10.1111/1753-0407.13171;"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has been reported to be associated with a more severe course in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, severe adverse outcomes are not recorded in all patients. In this study, we assessed disease outcomes in patients with and without T2DM hospitalized for COVID‐19. METHODS: A nationwide retrospective cohort of patients with T2DM hospitalized with confirmed COVID‐19 infection from 11 March to 30 May 2020 in the Turkish Ministry of Health database was investigated. Multivariate modeling was used to assess the independent predictors of demographic and clinical characteristics with mortality, length of hospital stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 18 426 inpatients (median age [interquartile range, IQR]: 61 [17] years; males: 43.3%) were investigated. Patients with T2DM (n = 9213) were compared with a group without diabetes (n = 9213) that were matched using the propensity scores for age and gender. Compared with the group without T2DM, 30‐day mortality following hospitalization was higher in patients with T2DM (13.6% vs 8.7%; hazard ratio 1.75; 95% CI, 1.58‐1.93; P < .001).

791;Medicinal plant compounds as promising inhibitors of coronavirus (COVID-19) main protease: an in silico study.;10.1080/07391102.2021.1906749;"The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe and has involved more than 215 countries and territories. Due to a lack of effective therapy or vaccine, urgent and concerted efforts are needed to identify therapeutic targets and medications. COVID-19 main protease represents a major target for drug treatment to inhibit viral function. The present study sought to evaluate medicinal plant compounds as potential inhibitors of the COVID-19 main protease using molecular docking and molecular dynamic analysis. The PDB files of COVID-19 main protease and some medicinal plant compounds were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org) and Pubchem server, respectively. The Gromacs software was used for simulation studies, and molecular docking analysis was done using Autodock 4.2. The COVID-19 main protease simulation, compared with some phytochemicals docked to the COVID-19 main protease, were analyzed. Glabridin, catechin, and fisetin had the greatest tendency to interact with the COVID-19 main protease by hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. Docking of these phytochemicals to COVID-19 main protease led to an increase in the radius of gyration (Rg), decrease in the Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and induced variation in COVID-19 main protease secondary structure. The high tendency interaction of glabridin, catechin, and fisetin to COVID-19 main protease induced conformational changes on this enzyme. These interactions can lead to enzyme inhibition. This simulated study indicates that these phytochemicals may be considered as potent inhibitors of the viral protease; however, more investigations are required to explore their potential medicinal use.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

792;Hypertension in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.;10.1536/ihj.20-323;It is unclear whether patients with hypertension are more likely to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) than the general population and whether there is a difference in the severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in patients who have taken ACEI/ARB drugs compared with those who have not.This observational study included data from all patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China, between January 5 and March 8, 2020. Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was cut off on March 8, 2020.A total of 274 patients, 75 with hypertension and 199 without hypertension, were included in the analysis. Compared with patients without hypertension, patients with hypertension were older and were more likely to have preexisting comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, patients with hypertension tended to have higher positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 PCR detection. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.005) and gender (P = 0.019) were independent risk factors associated with the severity of pneumonia in patients on admission, whereas ACEI/ARB treatment (P = 0.184) was not.Patients with COVID-19 with hypertension were significantly older and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease. ACEI/ARB drugs did not influence the severity of pneumonia in patients with SARS-CoV-2. In future studies, a larger sample size and multi-center clinical data would be needed to support these conclusions.;"https://doi.org/10.1536/ihj.20-323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33678794/";06/03/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9282
793;Predictors of long-term mortality after catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in a contemporary cohort of patients with structural heart disease.;10.1093/europace/euaa189;"AIMS Ablation of ventricular tachycardias (VTs) in patients with structural heart disease has been established in the past decades as an effective and safe treatment. However, the prognosis and long-term outcome remains poor. METHODS AND RESULTS We investigated 309 patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) (186 ICM, 123 NICM; 271 males; mean age 64.1 ± 12 years; ejection fraction 34 ± 13%) after ≥1 VT ablations over a mean follow-up period of 34 ± 28 months. Electrical storm was the indication for 224 patients (73%), whereas 86 patients (28%) underwent epicardial as well as endocardial ablation. During follow-up, 132 patients (43%) experienced VT recurrence and 97 (31%) died. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy and NICM patients showed comparable results, regarding procedural endpoints, complications, VT recurrence and survival. The Cox-regression analysis for all-cause mortality revealed that the presence of higher left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV; P < 0.001), male gender (P = 0.018), atrial fibrillation (AF; P < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; P = 0.001), antiarrhythmic drugs during the follow-up (P < 0.001), polymorphic VTs (P = 0.028), and periprocedural complications (P = 0.001) were independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION Ischaemic cardiomyopathy and NICM patients undergoing VT ablation had comparable results regarding procedural endpoints, complications, VT recurrence and 3-year mortality. Higher LVEDV, male gender, COPD, AF, polymorphic VTs, use of antiarrhythmics, and periprocedural complications are strong and independent predictors for increased mortality.

794;COVID-19 infection: Knowledge, attitude, practices, and impact among healthcare workers in a South-Eastern Nigerian state.;10.3855/jidc.13248;INTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection rate and mortality among Nigerian health care workers appear to be on the increase. This study determined the level of knowledge, attitude, practices, and impact of COVID-19 infection on healthcare workers (HCWs) working in a South-Eastern Nigerian state. METHODOLOGY This was a web-based, cross-sectional study conducted among healthcare workers in South-eastern, Nigeria during the lockdown period. Socio-demographic profile, knowledge of COVID-19, fears and impact concerning COVID-19, attitude of health workers to work, preventive practices during this pandemic period were obtained. Data were analysed using STATA 16.0. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests of association were used to determine the association between variables, with the significance level set at p < 0.05. RESULTS A total of 403 health care workers participated in the study. Majority of participants (n = 357, 88.59%) had good knowledge and good preventive practices (n = 328, 81.39%) of COVID-19. A significant proportion of respondents had a poor attitude to work (n = 101, 25.06%) and an attitude of indifference (n = 233, 57.82%). Almost half (48.64%) of participants had been negatively affected by COVID-19. Knowledge significantly influenced practice (p = 0.029). Lack of Personal protective equipment, fear of dying and going to common places, had a significant impact on the attitude of workers. CONCLUSION Good knowledge which influenced practice, high use of preventive practices, with associated poor and indifferent attitude was noted among healthcare workers. Fear of death and lack of personal protective equipment had a strong impact on attitude. Female HCWs had poorer attitude to work than males.;"https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031078/";30/09/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9509
795;Identifying common pharmacotherapies associated with reduced COVID-19 morbidity using electronic health records;10.1101/2020.04.11.20061994;"Objective: Absent a vaccine or any established treatments for the novel and highly infectious coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), rapid efforts to identify potential therapeutics are required. We sought to identify commonly prescribed medications that may be associated with lesser risk of morbidity with COVID-19 across 6 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using electronic health records from individuals evaluated in the emergency department between March 4, 2020 and July 12, 2020. Setting: Emergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 4 community hospitals. Participants: All individuals presenting to an emergency department and undergoing COVID-19 testing. Main Outcome or Measure: Inpatient hospitalization; documented requirement for mechanical ventilation. Results: Among 7,360 individuals with COVID-19 positive test results by PCR, 3,693 (50.2%) were hospitalized in one of 6 hospitals. In models adjusted for sociodemographic features and overall burden of medical illness, medications significantly associated with diminished risk for hospitalization included ibuprofen and sumatriptan. Among individuals who were hospitalized, 962(26.0%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 608 (16.5%) died; ibuprofen and naproxen were also more commonly prescribed among individuals not requiring intensive care. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that electronic health records may be applied to identify medications associated with lower risk of morbidity with COVID-19, but larger cohorts will be required to address the substantial problem of confounding by indication, such that extreme caution is warranted in interpreting nonrandomized results.

796;An Update on Pulmonary Hypertension in Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19);10.23750/abm.v91i4.10698;Coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) continues to be a pandemic with global implications. Respiratory system involvement is the most common manifestation in symptomatic patients. In this literature review, we describe the diagnosis, management, and implications of pulmonary hypertension (PH) among patients with COVID-19. We defined pulmonary hypertension as increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest. In our literature search, we identified 4 articles with details on pulmonary hypertension. Among these, two reported various echocardiographic details for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension. In 1 study evidence of pulmonary hypertension was noted in 13.4% of patients. Patients with severe COVID-19 were reported to have a higher proportion of pulmonary hypertension as compared to mild COVID-19 disease [22% vs 2%]. Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was significant in predicting mortality. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial injury, pulmonary embolism, and prior pulmonary hypertension were at a higher risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension. Multiple mechanisms for developing pulmonary hypertension that have been postulated are i) concomitant worsening myocardial injury, ii) cytokine storm, endothelial injury, hypercoagulability attributing to development of venous thromboembolism, iii) and the presence of thrombotic microangiopathy. Among patients with severe COVID-19 disease and pulmonary hypertension, complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, the requirement of intensive care unit admission, the requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality are higher.

At present patients need to visit a doctor/clinic to check-up their health. Due to COVID-19, there are risks for doctors and patients to be infected by COVID-19. There are many cases reported worldwide where doctors/nurses and low immunity power people are easily affected by Coronavirus. Many clinics, hospitals are not able to treat regular patients. Therefore, there is a need to change the system for healthcare monitoring. Different types of micro/nano, wearable sensors and devices are developed for diagnosing diseases. The advantages of these micro and wearable sensors are higher sensitivity, fast response and low power consumption. Other hand, Instead of bulky instruments these wearable microsensors can be embedded/attached with the patient and it can monitor the patient’s health remotely. Using modern computer and electronics technology like the Internet of Things (IoT) platform (which includes computer vision, Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), big data analysis, deep learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence), it will become a real time health monitoring system. In this chapter we will initially discuss the present day’s healthcare system, followed by micro and wearable sensors used for diagnostic purposes. Further focus of the chapter will be on the electronics used for driving the sensors, devices and the collected data will be transmitted. Finally the frameworks for IoT based wearable sensors will be discussed. These IoT based wearable sensors will be a solution for sustainable healthcare systems.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984810/;23/03/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9472
798;Telepsychiatry and other cutting edge technologies in Covid‐19 pandemic: bridging the distance in mental health assistance;10.1111/ijcp.13716;At the end of 2019 a novel coronavirus (COVID‐19) was identified in China. The high potential of human to human transmission led to subsequent COVID‐19 global pandemic. Public health strategies including reduced social contact and lockdown have been adopted in many countries. Nonetheless, social distancing and isolation could also represent risk factors for mental disorders, resulting in loneliness, reduced social support and under‐detection of mental health needs. Along with this, social distancing determines a relevant obstacle for direct access to psychiatric care services. The pandemic generates the urgent need for integrating technology into innovative models of mental healthcare. In this paper we discuss the potential role of telepsychiatry and other cutting‐edge technologies in the management of mental health assistance. We narratively review the literature to examine advantages and risks related to the extensive application of these new therapeutic settings, along with the possible limitations and ethical concerns. Telemental health services may be particularly feasible and appropriate for the support of patients, family members and health‐care providers during this COVID‐19 pandemic. The integration of telepsychiatry with other technological innovations (e.g., mobile apps, virtual reality, big data and artificial intelligence) opens up interesting future perspectives for the improvement of mental health assistance. Telepsychiatry is a promising and growing way to deliver mental health services but is still underused. The COVID‐19 pandemic may serve as an opportunity to introduce and promote, among numerous mental health professionals, the knowledge of the possibilities offered by the digital era.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32946641/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13716";18/09/2020;coronavirus;0.9899
799;Reopening dentistry after COVID-19: Complete suppression of aerosolization in dental procedures by viscoelastic Medusa Gorgo.;10.1063/5.0021476;"The aerosol transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has impacted the delivery of health care and essentially stopped the provision of medical and dental therapies. Dentistry uses rotary, ultrasonic, and laser-based instruments that produce water-based aerosols in the daily, routine treatment of patients. Abundant aerosols are generated, which reach health care workers and other patients. Viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 virus and related coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, continued expansion throughout the USA and the world. The virus is spread by both droplet (visible drops) and aerosol (practically invisible drops) transmission. The generation of aerosols in dentistry-an unavoidable part of most dental treatments-creates a high-risk situation. The US Centers for Disease Control and The Occupational Safety and Health Administration consider dental procedures to be of ""highest risk"" in the potential spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. There are several ways to reduce or eliminate the virus: (i) cease or postpone dentistry (public and personal health risk), (ii) screen patients immediately prior to dental treatment (by appropriate testing, if any), (iii) block/remove the virus containing aerosol by engineering controls together with stringent personal protective equipment use. The present work takes a novel, fourth approach. By altering the physical response of water to the rotary or ultrasonic forces that are used in dentistry, the generation of aerosol particles and the distance any aerosol may spread beyond the point of generation can be markedly suppressed or completely eliminated in comparison to water for both the ultrasonic scaler and dental handpiece.";"https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0021476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904886/";01/08/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9244

With little knowledge of COVID-19 virus, very few published reports on surgical outcomes; hospitals stopped elective surgery, whilst emergency surgery was offered only after exhausting all conservative treatment modalities. This study presents our experience of outcomes of emergency appendectomies performed during the pandemic. Methods - Prospectively we collected data on 132 patients in peak pandemic period from 1st March to 5th June 2020 and data compared with 206 patients operated in similar period in 2019. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, pre-operative events, investigations, surgical management, postoperative outcomes and complications were analysed. Results - Demographics and ASA grades of both cohorts were comparable. In study cohort 84.4% and 96.7% in control cohort had laparoscopic appendicectomy. Whilst the study cohort had 13.6% primary open operations, control cohort had 5.3%. Mean length of stay and early post-operative complications (<30 days) were similar in both cohorts apart from surgical site infections (p = 0.02) and one mortality in study cohort. Conclusion - In these overwhelming pandemic times, although conservative treatment of acute appendicitis is an option, a proportion of patients will need surgery. Our study shows that with careful planning and strict theatre protocols, emergency appendicectomy can be safely offered with minimal risk of spreading COVID-19 infection.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of LPR in COVID-19 pediatric patients with mild symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective multicenter analysis included hospitalized children with mild COVID-19 who received LPR at one of 13 hospitals in China from January 1, 2020, to June 1, 2020. Patients treated with LPR were matched with patients not treated with LPR (1:4) according to age, sex, and length of symptom onset and hospitalization. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were applied to compare differences between groups. Kaplan-Meier probability curves and Cox regression models were used to analyze nasal swab turning negative time (recovery time) and hospital discharge days. RESULTS In total, 23 patients treated with LPR were matched with 92 untreated controls. The median age of patients was 6 years, and 56.52% of them were male. All patients were discharged from the hospital after being cured. The treatment group had a longer nasal swab turning negative time (hazard ratio [HR] 5.33; 95% CI: 1.94-14.67; p = 0.001) than the control group. LPR treatment was also associated with a longer hospitalization time (HR 2.01; 95% CI: 1.24-3.29; p = 0.005). After adjusting for the influence of LPR treatment, adverse drug reaction events were associated with a longer nasopharyngeal swab negative time (HR 4.67; 95% CI 1.35-16.11; p = 0.015).

Hence, we assessed the impact of dental pain, fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress during lockdown on the oral health related quality of life of individuals visiting a tertiary dental care center during COVID-19 pandemic. Cross sectional study conducted among patients between 18-60 years. Demographics, access to pain killers, dental care (yes/no), duration ( 15 days) and intensity of pain were self reported. Fear of COVID-19 was assessed using fear of corona virus scale (FCV-19S); psychological distress in the last 30 days and oral health related quality of life was evaluated. Oral examination was performed and dental caries status (DMFT) was assessed using the world health organization method.

803;Implications of Changing Z-Score Models for Coronary Artery Dimensions in Kawasaki Disease;10.1007/s00246-020-02501-0;BACKGROUND: Coronary artery abnormalities in Kawasaki disease (KD) are assessed using echocardiographic z-scores. We hypothesized that changing the coronary artery (CA) z-score model would alter diagnosis and management of children with KD. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study of children treated for KD (9/2007–1/2020), we collected echocardiographic measurements for the left anterior descending (LAD), right (RCA), and left main (LMCA) coronary arteries during 3 illness phases and calculated Boston and Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) z-scores. Agreement between Boston and PHN z-scores was assessed using Kappa (κ) and Lin’s Concordance Correlation Coefficients (CCC) and Bland–Altman analysis. RESULTS: For 904 echocardiograms from 357 children, the median Boston LAD z-score was lower than the PHN (0.3 [IQR − 0.6, 1.5] vs 1.6 [IQR 0.7, 2.8], CCC 0.94 [95% CI 0.93, 0.95], moderate agreement), aggregated across all illness phases. RCA and LMCA z-scores showed substantial agreement. With conversion from Boston to PHN models, the percentage of individual LAD z-scores ≥ 2.5 increased (14.6% to 32.1%). At least one CA z-score classification changed in 213 children (59.7%) across all phases, and 48 children (13.4%) had a change that altered recommended antithrombotic strategy. Agreement between models differed by age, sex, and race. CONCLUSIONS: Conversion from Boston to PHN z-scores changed at least 1 CA z-score classification in over half of KD patients and changed recommended antithrombotic management in 13%, largely driven by LAD measurements. Since diagnosis and management of KD and KD-like diseases rely upon CA z-scores, the clinical and research implications of these findings merit further exploration.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394108/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-020-02501-0";04/01/2021;Coronary artery abnormalities in Kawasaki disease;0.9196
804;Mortality burden from seasonal influenza in Chongqing, China, 2012-2018.;10.1080/21645515.2019.1693721;Purpose: To estimate influenza-associated excess mortality rates (EMRs) in Chongqing from 2012 to 2018.Methods: We obtained weekly mortality data for all-cause and four underlying causes of death (circulatory and respiratory disease (CRD), pneumonia and influenza (P&I), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ischemic heart disease (IDH)), and influenza surveillance data, from 2012 to 2018. A negative-binomial regression model was used to estimate influenza-associated EMRs in two age groups (<65 years and ≥65 years).Results: It was estimated that an annual average of 10025 influenza-associated deaths occurred in Chongqing, corresponding to 5.2% of all deaths. The average EMR for all-cause death associated with influenza was 33.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 31.5-35.6) per 100 000 persons, and in separate cause-specific models we attributed 24.7 (95% CI: 23.3-26.0), 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-0.8), 8.5 (95% CI: 8.1-9.0) and 5.0 (95% CI: 4.7-5.3) per 100 000 persons EMRs to CRD, P&I, COPD and IDH, respectively. The estimated EMR for influenza B virus was 20.6 (95% CI: 20.3-21.0), which was significantly higher than the rates of 5.3 (95% CI: 4.5-6.1) and 7.5 (95% CI: 6.7-8.3) for A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) pdm09 virus, respectively. The estimated EMR was 152.3 (95% CI: 136.1-168.4) for people aged ≥65 years, which was significantly higher than the rate for those aged <65 years (6.8, 95% CI: 6.3-7.2).Conclusions: Influenza was associated with substantial EMRs in Chongqing, especially among elderly people. Influenza B virus caused a relatively higher excess mortality impact compared with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2). It is advisable to optimize future seasonal influenza vaccine reimbursement policy in Chongqing to curb disease burden.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2019.1693721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343618/";28/04/2020;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9236

We studied 37 asymptomatic individuals in the Wanzhou District who were diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections but without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 d and during hospitalization. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated Wanzhou People's Hospital for centralized isolation in accordance with policy1. The median duration of viral shedding in the asymptomatic group was 19 d (interquartile range (IQR), 15-26 d). The asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than the symptomatic group (log-rank P = 0.028). The virus-specific IgG levels in the asymptomatic group (median S/CO, 3.4; IQR, 1.6-10.7) were significantly lower (P = 0.005) relative to the symptomatic group (median S/CO, 20.5; IQR, 5.8-38.2) in the acute phase. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3% (28/30) and 81.1% (30/37) had reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively, during the early convalescent phase, as compared to 96.8% (30/31) and 62.2% (23/37) of symptomatic patients. Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative and 12.9% of the symptomatic group became negative for IgG in the early convalescent phase. In addition, asymptomatic individuals exhibited lower levels of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

806;Regional performance variation in external validation of four prediction models for severity of COVID-19 at hospital admission: An observational multi-centre cohort study;10.1101/2021.03.26.21254390;Background: Several prediction models for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) have been published. Prediction models should be externally validated to assess their performance before implementation. This observational cohort study aimed to validate published models of severity for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using clinical and laboratory predictors. Methods: Prediction models fitting relevant inclusion criteria were chosen for validation. The outcome was either mortality or a composite outcome of mortality and ICU admission (severe disease). 1295 patients admitted with symptoms of COVID-19 at Kings Cross Hospital (KCH) in London, United Kingdom, and 307 patients at Oslo University Hospital (OUH) in Oslo, Norway were included. The performance of the models was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration. Results: We identified two models for prediction of mortality (referred to as Xie and Zhang1) and two models for prediction of severe disease (Allenbach and Zhang2). The performance of the models was variable. For prediction of mortality Xie had good discrimination at OUH with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.87 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.95] and acceptable discrimination at KCH, AUROC 0.79 [0.76-0.82]. In prediction of severe disease, Allenbach had acceptable discrimination (OUH AUROC 0.81 [0.74-0.88] and KCH AUROC 0.72 [0.68-0.75]). The Zhang models had moderate to poor discrimination. Initial calibration was poor for all models but improved with recalibration. Conclusions: The performance of the four prediction models was variable. The Xie model had the best discrimination for mortality, while the Allenbach model had acceptable results for prediction of severe disease.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.26.21254390; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.26.21254390v1?rss=1";26/03/2021;coronavirus disease-19;0.9728
807;Compound heterozygous inheritance of two novel COQ2 variants results in familial coenzyme Q deficiency;10.1186/s13023-020-01600-8;BACKGROUND: Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a rare disease that results in diverse and variable clinical manifestations. Nephropathy, myopathy and neurologic involvement are commonly associated, however retinopathy has also been observed with certain pathogenic variants of genes in the coenzyme Q biosynthesis pathway. In this report, we describe a novel presentation of the disease that includes nephropathy and retinopathy without neurological involvement, and which is the result of a compound heterozygous state arising from the inheritance of two recessive potentially pathogenic variants, previously not described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective report, with complete ophthalmic examination, multimodal imaging, electroretinography, and whole exome sequencing performed on a family with three affected siblings. RESULTS: We show that affected individuals in the described family inherited two heterozygous variants of the COQ2 gene, resulting in a frameshift variant in one allele, and a predicted deleterious missense variant in the second allele (c.288dupC,p.(Ala97Argfs*56) and c.376C > G,p.(Arg126Gly) respectively). Electroretinography results were consistent with rod-cone dystrophy in the affected individuals. All affected individuals in the family exhibited the characteristic retinopathy as well as end-stage nephropathy, without evidence of any neurological involvement. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two novel compound heterozygous variants of the COQ2 gene that result in primary coenzyme Q deficiency. Targeted sequencing of coenzyme Q biosynthetic pathway genes may be useful in diagnosing oculorenal clinical presentations syndromes not explained by more well known syndromes (e.g., Senior-Loken and Bardet-Biedl syndromes).;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-020-01600-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33187544/";13/11/2020;Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency;0.9707
808;Assessing the vaccine effectiveness for hand, foot, and mouth disease in Guangzhou, China: a time-series analysis.;10.1080/21645515.2020.1763076;"OBJECTIVE Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an important public health issue in China. Although efficacy has been demonstrated by randomized controlled trials, the evidence for effectiveness of the monovalent Enterovirus 71 (EV71) vaccine against HFMD remains unknown. This study aimed to assess the vaccine effectiveness for HFMD in Guangzhou, China. METHODS Routinely collected vaccination and HFMD surveillance data were captured from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. We estimated the EV71 vaccine effectiveness using spatial ecologic and time-series analysis approaches. RESULTS A total of 174,002 HFMD cases under 5 years of age were reported to the Guangzhou, China surveillance system from January 2016 to December 2018. A total of 408,664 children completed a two-dose EV71 vaccination series. In an ecologic analysis, a two-dose EV71 vaccination rate above the median conferred lower HFMD risk relative to a vaccination rate below the median (ratio ratio = 0.955, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.949, 0.962; P < .001). In the time-series approach, 0.9% fewer HFMD cases were associated with a 1% increase in the two-dose EV71 vaccination rate, but without statistical significance (P = .094). However, we detected statistically significant protective associations for HFMD among children 3 years of age (0.9% fewer HFMD cases with a 1% increased vaccination rate; P = .046), and for EV71 (1.4%; P = .012) and ""other viruses"" (1.3%; P = .002), although not for Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). CONCLUSION Our findings, based on real-world data, provide evidence of EV71 vaccine effectiveness for preventing EV71 and ""other"" viruses associated with HFMD.

809;Sensors and Analytical Technologies for Air Quality: Particulate Matters and Bioaerosols.;10.1002/asia.202001051;Particulate matters (PMs), e.g. dusts, fibres, smokes, fumes, mists, liquid droplets and airborne respirable solid or liquid particles, are the major sources of air pollution concerning outdoor and indoor air quality. Among various PMs, bioaerosols are airborne particles that are either living organisms (bacteria, viruses, and fungi) or originated from living organisms (endotoxin, allergen etc). PMs and/or bioaerosols have adverse health effects of infection, allergy, and irritation. Proper management and source identification of PMs and bioaerosols will reduce their negative health impact. In this review, we will discuss the analytical technologies and sensors for PMs and bioaerosols. We will first introduce four types of PM analyser, namely filter-based gravimetric method (GMM), optical method, β-ray absorption method (BAM), and tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM). We will provide examples of how commercial analyzers of different principles have been compared and calibrated for specific applications under different climate conditions of specific geographic locations. For bioaerosols, having more complex biological and biochemical identity, we will start from air sampling techniques, followed by the discussion of various detection methods (plate culture, molecular methods, immunoassays and biosensors) in association with compatible sampling technologies. Using Influenza A (H1N1) virus and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus as examples, we have highlighted the differential air sampling and detection challenges for viral aerosols relative to bacterial and fungal aerosols. In the end, we provide a perspective for future trend according to the limitation of current commercial products and the key challenges in this field.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/asia.202001051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169915/";10/11/2020;SARS-CoV-2;0.9413
810;Characteristics and hospital course of patients admitted for acute cardiovascular diseases during the coronavirus disease-19 outbreak.;10.2459/jcm.0000000000001129;INTRODUCTION During the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak in spring 2020, people may have been reluctant to seek medical care fearing infection. We aimed to assess the number, characteristics and in-hospital course of patients admitted for acute cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS We enrolled all consecutive patients admitted urgently for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure or arrhythmias from 1 March to 31 May 2020 (outbreak period) and 2019 (control period). We evaluated the time from symptoms onset to presentation, clinical conditions at admission, length of hospitalization, in-hospital medical procedures and outcome. The combined primary end point included in-hospital death for cardiovascular causes, urgent heart transplant or discharge with a ventricular assist device. RESULTS A similar number of admissions were observed in 2020 (N = 210) compared with 2019 (N = 207). Baseline characteristics of patients were also similar. In 2020, a significantly higher number of patients presented more than 6 h after symptoms onset (57 versus 38%, P < 0.001) and with signs of heart failure (33 versus 20%, P = 0.018), required urgent surgery (13 versus 5%, P = 0.004) and ventilatory support (26 versus 13%, P < 0.001). Hospitalization duration was longer in 2020 (median 10 versus 8 days, P = 0.03). The primary end point was met by 19 (9.0%) patients in 2020 versus 10 (4.8%) in 2019 (P = 0.09). CONCLUSION Despite the similar number and types of unplanned admissions for acute cardiac conditions during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak compared with the same period in 2019, we observed a higher number of patients presenting late after symptoms onset as well as longer and more complicated clinical courses.;"https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186239/";12/11/2020;coronavirus disease-19;0.9162
811;The structural basis of accelerated host cell entry by SARS‐CoV‐2†;10.1111/febs.15651;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is the causative agent of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) that exhibits an overwhelming contagious capacity over other human coronaviruses (HCoVs). This structural snapshot describes the structural bases underlying the pandemic capacity of SARS‐CoV‐2 and explains its fast motion over respiratory epithelia that allow its rapid cellular entry. Based on notable viral spike (S) protein features, we propose that the flat sialic acid‐binding domain at the N‐terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit leads to more effective first contact and interaction with the sialic acid layer over the epithelium, and this, in turn, allows faster viral ‘surfing’ of the epithelium and receptor scanning by SARS‐CoV‐2. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE‐2) protein on the epithelial surface is the primary entry receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, and protein–protein interaction assays demonstrate high‐affinity binding of the spike protein (S protein) to ACE‐2. To date, no high‐frequency mutations were detected at the C‐terminal domain of the S1 subunit in the S protein, where the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) is located. Tight binding to ACE‐2 by a conserved viral RBD suggests the ACE2‐RBD interaction is likely optimal. Moreover, the viral S subunit contains a cleavage site for furin and other proteases, which accelerates cell entry by SARS‐CoV‐2. The model proposed here describes a structural basis for the accelerated host cell entry by SARS‐CoV‐2 relative to other HCoVs and also discusses emerging hypotheses that are likely to contribute to the development of antiviral strategies to combat the pandemic capacity of SARS‐CoV‐2.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264497/";14/12/2020;receptor‐binding domain;0.9409

A population-based electronic health record analysis in 1 958 184 individuals.;10.1101/2020.06.22.20137182;"Background: Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for coronavirus(COVID-19)-related mortality. We estimated excess mortality in obesity, both 'direct', through infection, and 'indirect', through changes in healthcare, and also due to potential increasing obesity during lockdown. Methods: In population-based electronic health records for 1 958 638 individuals in England, we estimated 1-year mortality risk('direct' and 'indirect' effects) for obese individuals, incorporating: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii)population infection rate, and (iii)relative impact on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.2, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). Using causal inference models, we estimated impact of change in body-mass index(BMI) and physical activity during 3-month lockdown on 1-year incidence for high-risk conditions(cardiovascular diseases, CVD; diabetes; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD and chronic kidney disease, CKD), accounting for confounders. Findings: For severely obese individuals (3.5% at baseline), at 10% population infection rate, we estimated direct impact of 240 and 479 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, and indirect effect of 383 to 767 excess deaths, assuming 40% and 80% will be affected at RR=1.2. Due to BMI change during the lockdown, we estimated that 97 755 (5.4%: normal weight to overweight, 5.0%: overweight to obese and 1.3%: obese to severely obese) to 434 104 individuals (15%: normal weight to overweight, 15%: overweight to obese and 6%: obese to severely obese) individuals would be at higher risk for COVID-19 over one year.

813;Predicting and interpreting COVID-19 transmission rates from the ensemble of government policies;10.1101/2020.08.27.20179853;Several questions resonate as the governments relax their COVID-19 mitigation policies - is it too early to relax them, were the policies as effective as they could have been. Answering these questions about the past or crafting newer policy decisions in the future requires a quantification of how policy choices affect the spread of the infection. Policy landscape as well as the infection trajectories from different states and countries diverged so fast that comparing and learning from them has not been easy. In this work, we standardize and pool together the ensemble of lockdown and graded re-opening policies adopted by the 50 states of USA in any given week between 9th March and 9th August. Using artificial intelligence (AI) on this pooled data, we build a predictive model (R2training=0.79, R2test=0.76) for the weekly-averaged transmission rate of infections. Predictability conceptually raises the possibility of an evidence-based or data-driven mitigation policy-making by evaluating the relative merits of the different policy scenarios. Probing the predictions with interpretable AI highlights how factors such as the closing of bars or the use of masks influence transmission, effects which have been hard to decouple from the ensemble of policy instrument combinations. While acknowledging the limitations of our predictions as well as of the infection testing, we ask the theoretical question if the observed transmission rates in the states were as efficient as they could have been under various levels of restrictions, and if the mitigation policies of the states are overdesigned. The model can be further refined with a more detailed inclusion of geographies and policy compliances, as well as expanded as newer policies emerge.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.20179853; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.27.20179853v1?rss=1";01/09/2020;19 mitigation policies;0.9289
814;More than just smell - COVID-19 is associated with severe impairment of smell, taste, and chemesthesis;10.1101/2020.05.04.20090902;Recent anecdotal and scientific reports have provided evidence of a link between COVID-19 and chemosensory impairments such as anosmia. However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, generally lacked quantitative measurements, and were mostly restricted to data from single countries. Here, we report the development, implementation and initial results of a multi-lingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in three distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, 8 other, ages 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change {+/-}100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7{+/-}28.7, mean{+/-}SD), taste (-69.0{+/-}32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3{+/-}36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell, but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20090902; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20090902v1?rss=1";08/05/2020;chemesthetic;0.9087
815;Adaptation to SARS‐CoV‐2 under stress: Role of distorted information;10.1111/eci.13294;"BACKGROUND: Since the time of global SARS‐CoV‐2 spread across the earth in February 2020, most of countries faced the problem of massive stress of their healthcare systems. In many cases, the structural stress was a result of incorrect allocation of medical care resources. In turn, this misallocation resulted from fear and apprehensions that superseded thorough calculations. A key role in exacerbating the healthcare sector overburdening was played by misleading information on the virus and disease caused by it. In the current paper, we study the situation in Russian healthcare system and advance recommendations how to avoid further crises. MATERIALS AND METHODS: (a) Surveying the medical personnel (231 doctors, 317 nurses and 355 ambulance medical workers of lower levels) in five hospitals and six ambulance centres in Moscow. (b) Content analysis of 3164 accounts in Russian segment of social networks (VKontakte, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Odnoklassniki); official and unofficial media (TV, informational webpages). RESULTS: We revealed positive‐feedback loop that threatened the sustainability of Russian care sector. The main knot was occupied by incorrect/exaggerated media coverage of COVID‐19. General public scared by misinformation in media and social networks, started to panic. This negative social background undermined the productivity of a significant part of medical workers who were afraid of COVID‐19 patients.

Thus, it has become crucial to avoid this transmission through precautions and keep premises hygienic using high-performance anti-viral nanomaterials to trap and eradicate SARS-CoV-2. Such an antiviral nano-system has successfully demonstrated useful significant contribution in COVID-19 pandemic/endemic management effectively. However, their projection with potential sustainable prospects still requires considerable attention and efforts.

The salient features of such various nanostructures, antiviral mechanisms, and high impact multi-dimensional roles are systematically discussed in this review. Additionally, the challenges associated with the projection of alternative approaches also support the demand and significance of this selected scientific topic.

The diagnosis of acute infection relies on RT-PCR based viral detection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the optimal serological testing strategy for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which provides an important indicator of prior infection and potential short-term immunity. METHODS The sensitivity and specificity of four different ELISA assays (Euroimmun IgG, Euroimmun NCP-IgG, Fortress and DIAsource) and one CLIA assay (Roche ELECSYS) were evaluated in 423 samples; 137 patients with confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 infection (true positives), and 100 pre-pandemic samples collected prior to October 2019 (true negatives). A further 186 samples were collected from healthcare staff and analysed by all five assays. RESULTS The Fortress ELISA assay demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity followed by the Roche ECLIA assay. The highest overall sensitivity came from the assays that measured total antibody (IgM-IgG combined) and the three assays that performed the best (Fortress, Roche, Euroimmun IgG) all have different antigens as their target proteins which suggests that antigen target does not affect assay performance. In mildly symptomatic participants with either a negative RT-PCR or no RT-PCR performed, 16.76% had detectable antibodies suggesting previous infection. CONCLUSIONS We recommend a combined testing strategy utilising assays with different antigenic targets using the fully automated Roche ECLIA assay and confirming discordant samples with the Fortress Total Antibody ELISA assay.

818;Pattern of circulating SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibody‐secreting and memory B‐cell generation in patients with acute COVID‐19;10.1002/cti2.1245;OBJECTIVES: To predict the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19), information regarding the immunological memory for disease‐specific antigens is necessary. The possibility of reinfection, as well as the efficacy of vaccines for COVID‐19 that are currently under development, will largely depend on the quality and longevity of immunological memory in patients. To elucidate the process of humoral immunity development, we analysed the generation of plasmablasts and virus receptor‐binding domain (RBD)‐specific memory B (Bmem) cells in patients during the acute phase of COVID‐19. METHODS: The frequencies of RBD‐binding plasmablasts and RBD‐specific antibody‐secreting cells (ASCs) in the peripheral blood samples collected from patients with COVID‐19 were measured using flow cytometry and the ELISpot assay. RESULTS: The acute phase of COVID‐19 was characterised by the transient appearance of total as well as RBD‐binding plasmablasts. ELISpot analysis indicated that most patients exhibited a spontaneous secretion of RBD‐specific ASCs in the circulation with good correlation between the IgG and IgM subsets. IL‐21/CD40L stimulation of purified B cells induced the activation and proliferation of Bmem cells, which led to the generation of plasmablast phenotypic cells as well as RBD‐specific ASCs. No correlation was observed between the frequency of Bmem cell‐derived and spontaneous ASCs, suggesting that the two types of ASCs were weakly associated with each other. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific Bmem cells are generated during the acute phase of COVID‐19. These findings can serve as a basis for further studies on the longevity of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific B‐cell memory.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33552508/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1245";31/01/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9157
819;ACE2 variants underlie interindividual variability and susceptibility to COVID-19 in Italian population;10.1101/2020.04.03.20047977;In December 2019, an initial cluster of unexpected interstitial bilateral pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province. A human-to-human transmission was immediately assumed and a previously unrecognized entity, termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) was suddenly described. The infection has rapidly spread out all over the world and Italy has been the first European Country experiencing the endemic wave with unexpected clinical severity in comparison with Asian countries. It has recently been shown that 2019-nCov utilizes host receptors namely angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as host receptor and host proteases for cell surface binding and internalization. Thus, a predisposing genetic background can give reason for interindividual disease susceptibility and/or severity. Taking advantage of the Network of Italian Genomes (NIG), here we mined around 7000 exomes from 5 different Centers looking for ACE2 variants. A number of variants with a potential impact on protein stability were identified. Among these, three missense changes, p.Asn720Asp, p.Lys26Arg, p.Gly211Arg (MAF 0.002 to 0.015), which have never been reported in the Eastern Asia population, were predicted to interfere with protein cleavage and stabilization. Rare truncating variants likely interfering with the internalization process and one missense variant, p.Trp69Cys, predicted to interfere with 2019-nCov spike protein binding were also observed. These findings suggest that a predisposing genetic background may contribute to the observed inter-individual clinical variability associated with COVID-19. They allow an evidence-based risk assessment opening up the way to personalized preventive measures and therapeutic options.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.03.20047977v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20047977";06/04/2020;coronavirus disease 19;0.9836
820;Parkinson’s disease–associated VPS35 mutant reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and impairs PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy;10.1186/s40035-021-00243-4;BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD), and several genes linked to familial PD, including PINK1 (encoding PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 [PINK1]) and PARK2 (encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin), are directly involved in processes such as mitophagy that maintain mitochondrial health. The dominant p.D620N variant of vacuolar protein sorting 35 ortholog (VPS35) gene is also associated with familial PD but has not been functionally connected to PINK1 and PARK2. METHODS: To better mimic and study the patient situation, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate heterozygous human SH-SY5Y cells carrying the PD-associated D620N variant of VPS35. These cells were treated with a protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to induce the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, which was assessed using biochemical and microscopy approaches. RESULTS: Mitochondria in the VPS35-D620N cells exhibited reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and appeared to already be damaged at steady state. As a result, the mitochondria of these cells were desensitized to the CCCP-induced collapse in mitochondrial potential, as they displayed altered fragmentation and were unable to accumulate PINK1 at their surface upon this insult. Consequently, Parkin recruitment to the cell surface was inhibited and initiation of the PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy was impaired. CONCLUSION: Our findings extend the pool of evidence that the p.D620N mutation of VPS35 causes mitochondrial dysfunction and suggest a converging pathogenic mechanism among VPS35, PINK1 and Parkin in PD.

We aimed to identify subtypes of pediatric ARDS based on whole blood transcriptomics. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of children with ARDS at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) between January 2018 and June 2019. We collected blood within 24 h of ARDS onset, generated expression profiles, and performed k-means clustering to identify sub-phenotypes. We tested the association between sub-phenotypes and PICU mortality and ventilator-free days at 28 days using multivariable logistic and competing risk regression, respectively. RESULTS: We enrolled 106 subjects, of whom 96 had usable samples. We identified three sub-phenotypes, dubbed CHOP ARDS Transcriptomic Subtypes (CATS) 1, 2, and 3. CATS-1 subjects (n = 31) demonstrated persistent hypoxemia, had ten subjects (32%) with immunocompromising conditions, and 32% mortality. CATS-2 subjects (n = 29) had more immunocompromising diagnoses (48%), rapidly resolving hypoxemia, and 24% mortality. CATS-3 subjects (n = 36) had the fewest comorbidities and also had rapidly resolving hypoxemia and 8% mortality. The CATS-3 subtype was associated with lower mortality (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04–0.86) and higher probability of extubation (subdistribution HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.32–4.32), relative to CATS-1 after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: We identified three sub-phenotypes of pediatric ARDS using whole blood transcriptomics. The sub-phenotypes had divergent clinical characteristics and prognoses. Further studies should validate these findings and investigate mechanisms underlying differences between sub-phenotypes.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7720038/;07/12/2020;Acute respiratory distress syndrome;0.9453
822;Randomised clinical trial: exclusive enteral nutrition versus standard of care for acute severe ulcerative colitis.;10.1111/apt.16249;"BACKGROUND Intravenous corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy for acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC), but 30%-40% of patients fail to respond. AIM To investigate the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) as adjunctive therapy to intravenous corticosteroids in patients with ASUC. METHODS This was an open-label randomised controlled trial, in which patients who were admitted with ASUC between August 2018 and May 2020 were randomised 1:1 to EEN or standard of care (SOC). Patients on EEN received a semi-elemental formula for 7 days along with SOC. The primary outcome was corticosteroid failure, defined by the need for salvage medical therapy or colectomy. Faecal microbial analysis was performed on day 1 and day 7 by 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing in some patients. RESULTS Of 62 patients (mean age 35.3 ± 12.1 years, 40% male), 32 were randomised to EEN and 30 to SOC. Corticosteroid failure was lower on EEN compared to SOC (intention-to-treat analysis 25% vs 43%, P = 0.051; per protocol analysis 19% vs 43%, P = 0.04), without any difference in colectomy rate (9% vs 13%; P = 0.41). Patients on EEN had a shorter hospital stay [median (range) 10 (8-17) vs 13 (8-24) days; P = 0.04], higher day 7 albumin level (34 ± 4 vs 29 ± 3 g/L, P < 0.01), greater reduction in serum C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin levels (both P = 0.04) and a lower composite outcome of colectomy/hospitalisation at 6 months (16% vs 39%; P = 0.045) compared to SOC. Patients on EEN showed increased abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae on day 7, with reduced Bifidobacterium and Veillonellaceae compared to SOC. CONCLUSIONS EEN for 7 days may augment corticosteroid responsiveness in patients with ASUC.

823;VEGF-Induced Endothelial Podosomes via ROCK2-Dependent Thrombomodulin Expression Initiate Sprouting Angiogenesis.;10.1161/atvbaha.121.315931;OBJECTIVE VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) plays a critical role in physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Endothelial 3D podosomes (3DPs) are a type of F-actin-rich membrane microdomain, predominantly found in endothelial tip cells controlled by VEGF signaling during sprouting angiogenesis, such as occurs in retinal vasculature development. The molecular mechanisms governing 3DP formation have not been completely elucidated. Approach and Results: By using in vitro cell models and in vivo mouse models, we study the role of TM (thrombomodulin) in VEGF-induced endothelial 3DPs. Here, we report that VEGF can induce the expression of TM via ROCK2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2). Furthermore, ROCK2 can catalyze the phosphorylated activation of ezrin to promote the association of the cytoplasmic domain of TM with F-actin in 3DPs and thereby promote the formation of 3DPs. We used endothelial cells transfected with different TM mutants as models to verify the role of TM domains in 3DPs and angiogenic activity. TM expression in endothelial cells augments angiogenic activity, a response that is dependent on the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of TM with ezrin, and the integrity of the lectin-like domain of TM. Thus, as compared with wild-type counterparts, mice lacking the lectin-like domain of TM exhibit reduced neovascularization of granulation tissues during cutaneous wound healing and less retinal neovascularization in a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS VEGF-ROCK2-ezrin-TM-F-actin axis promotes the formation of the lipid raft membrane-associated complex configuration, 3DP, which plays a critical role in mediating tube formation and cell migration of endothelial cells in sprouting angiogenesis.;"https://doi.org/10.1161/atvbaha.121.315931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730876/";18/03/2021;vascular endothelial growth factor;0.9484
824;Mapping Telemedicine in German Private Practice Urological Care: Implications for Transitioning beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic.;10.1159/000515982;BACKGROUND There are limited data on the use and concern of telemedicine among German urologists, and thus, there are no established guidelines for telemedical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of urological indications. METHODS An anonymized survey was conducted among German private practice urologists during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The χ2 test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS 257 urologists were included in the final analysis. Thirty-five (14.0%) of urologists had used telemedicine as part of their consultation, and 221 (86.0%) had not used telemedicine. There was no difference between telemedicine adoption rates between rural and urban settings. Telemedicine users were significantly more satisfied with the information they had received regarding telemedicine issues. Users saw the greatest barrier to telemedicine that patients do not take up the offer of telemedicine. Nonusers were most concerned with unclear indications for telemedicine followed by lesser reimbursements during telemedicine than in-person visitations. Users were significantly more likely to use telemedicine beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists, who wanted to use the service in the future, wanted an active support by the German society of urology and guidelines for telemedicine. Last, users and nonusers preferred telemedicine for non-acute chronic diseases and follow-up visitations. CONCLUSION Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine remains a rarely used service among German private practice urologists. Ultimately, to overcome the current challenges, urologists require an active support for the service through the German Society of Urology and telemedical guidelines.;"https://doi.org/10.1159/000515982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951666/";05/05/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9424
825;Cardiac involvement in consecutive unselected hospitalized COVID-19 population: In-hospital evaluation and one-year follow-up;10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.06.056;Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) can occur in COVID-19 and has impact on clinical course. Data on CVD prevalence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and sequelae in survivors is limited. Aim of this prospective study carried out on consecutive unselected COVID-19 population, was to assess: 1) CVD occurrence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 2) persistence or new onset of CVD at one-month and one-year follow-up. Methods Over 30 days n = 152 COVID-19 patients underwent cardiovascular evaluation. Standard electrocardiogram (ECG), Troponin and echocardiography were integrated by further tests when indicated. Medical history, arterial blood gas, blood tests, chest computed tomography and treatment were recorded. CVD was defined as the occurrence of a new condition during the hospitalization for COVID-19. Survivors attended a one-month follow-up visit and a one-year telephone follow-up. Results Forty-two patients (28%) experienced a wide spectrum of CVD with acute myocarditis being the most frequent. Death occurred in 32 patients (21%) and more frequently in patients who developed CVD (p = 0.032). After adjustment for confounders, CVD was independently associated with death occurrence. At one-month follow-up visit, 7 patients (9%) presented persistent or delayed CVD. At one-year telephone follow-up, 57 patients (48%) reported persistent symptoms. Conclusion Cardiovascular evaluation in COVID-19 patients is crucial since the occurrence of CVD in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is common (28%), requires specific treatment and increases the risk of in-hospital mortality. Persistence or delayed presentation of CVD at 1-month (9%) and persistent symptoms at 1-year follow-up (48%) suggest the need for monitoring COVID-19 survivors.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167527321010949; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527321010949?v=s5";03/07/2021;Conclusion Cardiovascular evaluation;0.9108
826;A mathematical model to predict the porosity of nickel pillars manufactured by localized electrochemical deposition under pulsed voltage conditions;10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.036;Abstract Metal parts manufactured with engineered porosity offer advantages over traditional parts as they have excellent specific mechanical properties at a lower weight. This is especially of interest in the aerospace and automobile industries. Additive manufacturing allows for creating parts with computer aided design (CAD) modeled lattice structures that offer lightweight parts. However, there is a need for porous structures at the micron scale (<50 µm) which cannot be achieved in a controlled manner using traditional powder-bed based metal additive manufacturing processes. Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing (ECAM) is a novel non-thermal metal additive manufacturing process capable of producing metal 3D parts with engineered porosity at the micron scale. There is a lack of understanding of the cause of porosity and controlling the porosity generated in the parts created using this process. In this paper, the effects of the electrical parameters of deposition, such as the pulse duty cycle and pulse frequency during electrodeposition, on the porosity of the manufactured parts were mathematically modeled. The model predicts that higher frequency electrodeposition leads to more porous structures. The model developed in this study can be used to predict the process parameters needed to deposit nickel microstructures with desired levels of porosity between 20 and 55 %. These model predictions were also validated by experiments. Two mechanisms for the cause of porosity in the deposits were identified. The diffusion-limited deposition phenomenon causing a lack of availability of cations results in larger sized pores and hollow structures to form on the part. The crystal growth and the nucleation process cause micron-scale pores.;"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314876; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314876";31/12/2020;computer aided design;0.9826
827;Enhancing psychological safety in mental health services;10.1186/s13033-021-00439-1;BACKGROUND: Psychological safety—speaking up about ideas and concerns, free from interpersonal risk—are essential to the high-risk environment, such as healthcare settings. Psychologically safe working is particularly important in mental health where recovery-oriented approaches rely on collaborative efforts of interprofessional teams to make complex decisions. Much research focuses on antecedents and outcomes associated with psychological safety, but little focus on the practical steps for how to increase psychological safety across and at different levels of a healthcare organisation. AIMS: We explore how a mental health organisation creates an organisation-wide plan for building the foundations of mental health and how to enhance psychological safety. METHODS: This review encompasses strategies across psychological safety and organisational culture change to increase psychological safety at an individual, team and organisational level. SUMMARY: We set out a comprehensive overview of the types of strategies and interventions for increasing the ethos of psychological safety and setting the foundations for delivering an organisation-wide programme on this topic. We also provide a list of key targeted areas in mental health that would maximally benefit from increasing psychological safety—both in clinical and non-clinical settings. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological safety is a crucial determinant of safe and effective patient care in mental health services. This paper provides the key steps and considerations, creating a large-scale programme in psychological safety with a focus on mental health and drawing from the current literature, providing concrete steps for how our current understanding of psychological safety into practice.;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-021-00439-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853658/";14/04/2021;Psychological safety;0.9477
828;“Know your epidemic, know your response”: Epidemiological assessment of the substance use disorder crisis in the United States;10.1371/journal.pone.0251502;The United States (U.S.) is currently experiencing a substance use disorders (SUD) crisis with an unprecedented magnitude. The objective of this study was to recognize and characterize the most vulnerable populations at high risk of SUD mortality in the U.S., and to identify the locations where these vulnerable population are located. We obtained the most recent available mortality data for the U.S. population aged 15–84 (2005–2017) from the Centers for Diseases and Prevention (CDC). Our analysis focused on the unintentional substance poisoning to estimate SUD mortality. We computed health-related comorbidities and socioeconomic association with the SUD distribution. We identified the most affected populations and conducted a geographical clustering analysis to identify places with increased concentration of SUD related deaths. From 2005–2017, 463,717 SUD-related deaths occurred in the United States. White population was identified with the highest SUD death proportions. However, there was a surge of the SUD epidemic in the Black male population, with a sharp increase in the SUD-related death rate since 2014. We also found that an additional average day of mental distress might increase the relative risk of SUD-related mortality by 39%. The geographical distribution of the epidemic showed clustering in the West and Mid-west regions of the U.S. In conclusion, we found that the SUD epidemic in the U.S. is characterized by the emergence of several micro-epidemics of different intensities across demographic groups and locations within the country. The comprehensive description of the epidemic presented in this study could assist in the design and implementation of targeted policy interventions for addiction mitigation campaigns.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8153501/;26/05/2021;substance use disorders;0.9942
829;Incidence Rate of COVID-19 Infection in Hemoglobinopathies: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.;10.1080/03630269.2021.1927751;During the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies were performed to determine the mortality and incidence rates of coronavirus infection among patients with hemoglobinopathies. However, there has been no systematic approach or meta-analysis to evaluate the results worldwide. This meta-analysis summarized the existing evidence of incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 and related risk factors among patients with hemoglobinopathies with a focus on β-thalassemia (β-thal) and sickle cell disease. The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Two authors independently screened the articles, extracted eligible ones, and assessed the quality of studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. The collected data were analyzed by the Stata software. The amount of heterogeneity was demonstrated by the I2 test. The incidence of COVID-19 among patients with a hemoglobinopathy, β-thal and sickle cell disease was 4.44, 1.34, and 17.22 per 100,000 person-day, respectively, to June 15 2020. The mortality rate of COVID-19 in patients with hemoglobin (Hb) disorders was calculated as 1.07 per 1000 person-day in the same period. Our findings showed a higher incidence rate of COVID-19 in sickle cell disease patients compared to the general population. A slightly higher mortality rate was also observed in patients with hemoglobinopathies compared to the general population, possibly due to the associated risk factors and comorbidities in this vulnerable group, which underscore special care, timely diagnosis and management along with current immunization, were crucial in decreasing the frequency, disease severity and mortality of these patients.;"https://doi.org/10.1080/03630269.2021.1927751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027786/";24/05/2021;coronavirus-19 disease;0.9856
830;Impact of race on care, readmissions, and survival for patients with glioblastoma: an analysis of the National Cancer Database.;10.1093/noajnl/vdab040;Background The objective of this study was to explore racial/ethnic factors that may be associated with survival in patients with glioblastoma by querying the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Methods The NCDB was queried for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma between 2004 and 2014. Patient demographic variables included age at diagnosis, sex, race, ethnicity, Charlson-Deyo score, insurance status, and rural/urban/metropolitan location of zip code. Treatment variables included surgical treatment, extent of resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, type of radiation, and treatment facility type. Outcomes included 30-day readmission, 30- and 90-day mortality, and overall survival. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate variables associated with race and overall survival. Results A total of 103 652 glioblastoma patients were identified. There was a difference in the proportion of patients for whom surgery was performed, as well as the proportion receiving radiation, when stratified by race (P < .001). Black non-Hispanics had the highest rates of unplanned readmission (7.6%) within 30 days (odds ratio [OR]: 1.39 compared to White non-Hispanics, P < .001). Asian non-Hispanics had the lowest 30- (3.2%) and 90-day mortality (9.8%) when compared to other races (OR: 0.52 compared to White non-Hispanics, P = .031). Compared to White non-Hispanics, we found Black non-Hispanics (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.88, P < .001), Asian non-Hispanics (HR: 0.72, P < .001), and Hispanics (HR: 0.69, P < .001) had longer overall survival. Conclusions Differences in treatment and outcomes exist between races.

831;Association between male sex and outcomes of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid‐19) – a Danish nationwide, register-based study;10.1093/cid/ciaa924;"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Male sex has been associated with severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infection. We examined the association between male sex and severe Covid-19 infection and if an increased risk remains after adjustment for age and comorbidities. METHODS: Nationwide register-based follow-up study of Covid-19 patients in Denmark until May 16, 2020. Average risk ratio comparing 30-day composite outcome of all-cause death, severe Covid-19 diagnosis or intensive care unit (ICU) admission for men versus women standardized to the age and comorbidity distribution of all patients were derived from multivariable Cox regression. Included covariates were age, hypertension, diagnoses including obesity, alcohol, sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, peripheral artery disease, cancer, liver-, rheumatic-, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). RESULTS: Of 4,842 Covid-19 patients, 2,281 (47.1%) were men. Median age was 57 [25%-75% 43-73] for men versus 52 [38-71] for women (P<0.001); however, octogenarians had equal sex distribution. Alcohol diagnosis, diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, prior MI and IHD (all P<0.001) as well as AF, stroke and HF (all P=0.01) were more often seen in men, and so was CKD (P=0.03). Obesity diagnosis (P<0.001) were more often seen in women. Other comorbidity differences were insignificant (P>0.05). The fully adjusted average risk ratio was 1.63 [95% CI 1.44-1.84].

832;Minimally Invasive Surgical Approach for the Treatment of Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome: Long-Term Outcomes.;10.1007/s00268-020-05413-5;"BACKGROUND Latero-lateral duodenojejunostomy is the treatment of choice for superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS). The present study analyzes the long-term outcomes in 13 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for SMAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study of 10 females and three males undergoing surgery between 2001 and 2013 was performed. Demographic, clinical and radiologic data and long-term surgical outcomes were recorded. In 12 patients latero-lateral duodenojejunostomy and in one patient distal laparoscopic gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction were performed. The median age was 24 years (20-28), and the median duration of symptoms was 24 months (5-24). The most frequent symptoms were abdominal pain (n = 11; 92.3%), nausea and vomiting (n = 10; 77%) and weight loss (n = 9; 69.2%). The median operating time was 98 min (86-138) and hospital stay was 3 days (1-14). RESULTS No reconversions occurred, and one patient experienced gastric emptying delay in the immediate postoperative period with spontaneous resolution. In four patients, SMAS was associated with severe stenosis of the celiac trunk which was treated in the same operation, and four patients presented stenosis of the left renal vein (the ""nutcracker"" phenomenon). With a median follow-up of 94 months (SD 65.3), eight patients (61.5%) had excellent results. One patient had a relapse of symptoms 4 years after surgery requiring distal gastrectomy, two patients presented delay in gastric emptying following temporary improvement and one patient experienced no improvement.

833;Development of a Community Orientation Program (COP) as a Community-Based Medical Education method for undergraduate medical students: An experience from India;10.1101/2021.02.07.21251321;Background- Intraregional cultural and linguistic differences are common in the Low- and Middle-income countries. They must focus on innovative teaching for the undergraduate (UG) medical students to make them sensitive to the social and contextual determinants of health to achieve the health for all goal. The early introduction of community-based medical education could be a game changing strategy. Objectives- To describe the methods, evaluation, implication, and challenges of a Community Orientation Programme (COP) adopted for the Indian Medical Graduates (IMG). Methods: The COP was arranged for the first-year UG students, including the community and the local administration. The program was divided into phases like- initial preparation, theoretical sessions, field visits, group activities, data analysis, and dissemination of the findings. In this learner-centric, supervised educational program, the key aim was to focus on developing students communication skills, observation power and enhancing their motivation for learning new things through collaborative learning. A mixture of adult learning theories like behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, sociocultural theory, critical theory, and humanism included keeping the students needs, cultural differences, and varying motivational levels. A structured feedback mechanism from the students was developed to identify the gaps. Conclusion- The COP has provided a holistic learning framework for the students based on several complementary learning theories in the Indian context. It has touched upon most of the national- and institutional-level objectives envisioned by the regulatory body for the IMGs. All stakeholders should promote such programs and solve the challenges collectively.;http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251321v1?rss=1;09/02/2021;Community Orientation Programme;0.9808
834;Quality of life following adult veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review;10.1007/s11136-021-02834-0;BACKGROUND: Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) has been used successfully for the past decade in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) refractory to conventional ventilatory support. However, knowledge of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in VV-ECMO patients is still limited. Thus, this study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the HRQoL following VV-ECMO support in ARDS patients. METHODS: A systematic search was performed on PubMed and Web of Science databases from January 1st, 2009 to October 19th, 2020. Studies reporting on HRQoL following VV-ECMO for ARDS in adults were included. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. RESULTS: Eight studies were eligible for inclusion, consisting of seven observational studies and one randomized controlled trial (total N = 441). All eight studies had a quantitative design and reported 265 VV-ECMO survivors to have a reduced HRQoL compared to a generally healthy population. Follow-up time varied between six months to three years. Additionally, only four studies (total N = 335) compared the HRQoL of VV-ECMO (N = 159) to conventionally treated survivors (N = 176), with one study showing a significantly better HRQoL in VV-ECMO survivors, while three studies were stating comparable HRQoL across groups. Notably, most survivors in these studies appeared to experience varying degrees of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). CONCLUSIONS: ARDS survivors supported by VV-ECMO have a decline in HRQoL and suffered from physical and psychological impairments. This HRQoL reduction is comparable or even better to the HRQoL in conventionally treated ARDS survivors.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826058/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-021-02834-0";07/04/2021;Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation;0.9177
835;SIRT Compared with DEB-TACE for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: a Real-world Study (the SITAR Study).;10.1007/s12029-020-00502-z;BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is responsible for 1% of deaths worldwide, and the incidence continues to increase. Despite surveillance programs, 70% of HCC patients are not suitable for curative options at diagnosis, and therefore, non-curative treatments are essential to modern clinical practice. There are many novel treatments, though their roles are not well defined. This study aimed to contrast Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) and Drug Eluting Bead Transarterial Chemoembolisation (DEB-TACE) to further define their roles. METHODS This was a retrospective multicentre cohort study. Factors included for analysis were type of HCC treatment, number of lesions, lesion size, multiple disease severity scores, cirrhosis and vascular invasion. The primary endpoint was transplant-free survival. RESULTS Transplant-free survival was similar between the two cohorts (p = 0.654), despite a variation in median lesion size, SIRT: 54.5 mm, DEB-TACE: 34 mm (p ≤ 0.001). A univariate Cox proportional hazard model utilising treatment modality as the covariate showed no significant difference in survival (DEB-TACE HR 1.4 (95%CI 0.85-2.15 p = 0.207). The size of the largest lesion was the best predictor of 3-year survival (p = 0.035). Lesion size was inversely associated with survival (HR 1.01 (95%CI 1-1.02, p = 0.025)) on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION This study is the first to catalogue the experience of using SIRT in HCC in a real-world Australian population. It has demonstrated no difference in survival outcomes between DEB-TACE and SIRT. Further, it has shown SIRT to be a reasonable alternative to DEB-TACE especially in larger lesions and has demonstrated that DEB-TACE has a role in select patients with advanced disease.;"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12029-020-00502-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901445/";09/09/2020;Hepatocellular carcinoma;0.9583
836;Prácticas de retiro del equipo de protección personal para personal sanitario.;10.1080/15459624.2021.1877056;RESUMENCuando se retira el equipo de protección personal (EPP), los patógenos pueden transferirse desde el EPP al cuerpo de los trabajadores de la salud, poniendo en riesgo de exposición e infección tanto a ellos mismos como a sus pacientes. Entre marzo de 2017 y abril de 2018 se observaron las prácticas de retirada del EPP del personal sanitario que atendía pacientes con infecciones respiratorias virales en un hospital de atención de enfermedades agudas. Un observador capacitado registró el desempeño del personal sanitario cuando retiraba el EPP dentro de las habitaciones de los pacientes, utilizando una lista de verificación predefinida basada en las directrices de los Centros para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC). Se observaron 162 prácticas de retirada durante el cuidado de 52 pacientes infectados con patógenos virales respiratorios. De estos 52 pacientes, 30 estaban en aislamiento por gota y contacto, 21 en aislamiento por gota y uno en aislamiento de contacto. En general, en 90% de los casos la retirada del EPP observada se realizó de manera incorrecta, ya sea en cuanto a la secuencia de retirada, la técnica de retirada o el uso del EPP apropiado.

837;A high-throughput fluorescence polarization assay to discover inhibitors of arenavirus and coronavirus exoribonucleases;10.1101/2021.04.02.437736;Viral exoribonucleases are uncommon in the world of RNA viruses. To date, this activity has been identified only in the Arenaviridae and the Coronaviridae families. These exoribonucleases play important but different roles in both families: for mammarenaviruses the exoribonuclease is involved in the suppression of the host immune response whereas for coronaviruses, exoribonuclease is both involved in a proofreading mechanism ensuring the genetic stability of viral genomes and participating to evasion of the host innate immunity. Because of their key roles, they constitute attractive targets for drug development. Here we present a high-throughput assay using fluorescence polarization to assess the viral exoribonuclease activity and its inhibition. We validate the assay using three different viral enzymes from SARS-CoV-2, lymphocytic choriomeningitis and Machupo viruses. The method is sensitive, robust, amenable to miniaturization (384 well plates) and allowed us to validate the proof-of-concept of the assay by screening a small focused compounds library (23 metal chelators). We also determined the IC50 of one inhibitor common to the three viruses.

838;Impact of the Programa Mais médicos (more doctors Programme) on primary care doctor supply and amenable mortality: quasi-experimental study of 5565 Brazilian municipalities;10.1186/s12913-020-05716-2;BACKGROUND: Investing in human resources for health (HRH) is vital for achieving universal health care and the Sustainable Development Goals. The Programa Mais Médicos (PMM) (More Doctors Programme) provided 17,000 doctors, predominantly from Cuba, to work in Brazilian primary care. This study assesses whether PMM doctor allocation to municipalities was consistent with programme criteria and associated impacts on amenable mortality. METHODS: Difference-in-differences regression analysis, exploiting variation in PMM introduction across 5565 municipalities over the period 2008–2017, was employed to examine programme impacts on doctor density and mortality amenable to healthcare. Heterogeneity in effects was explored with respect to doctor allocation criteria and municipal doctor density prior to PMM introduction. RESULTS: After starting in 2013, PMM was associated with an increase in PMM-contracted primary care doctors of 15.1 per 100,000 population. However, largescale substitution of existing primary care doctors resulting in a net increase of only 5.7 per 100,000. Increases in both PMM and total primary care doctors were lower in priority municipalities due to lower allocation of PMM doctors and greater substitution effects. The PMM led to amenable mortality reductions of − 1.06 per 100,000 (95%CI: − 1.78 to − 0.34) annually – with greater benefits in municipalities prioritised for doctor allocation and where doctor density was low before programme implementation. CONCLUSIONS: PMM potential health benefits were undermined due to widespread allocation of doctors to non-priority areas and local substitution effects. Policies seeking to strengthen HRH should develop and implement needs-based criteria for resource allocation.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32933503/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05716-2";15/09/2020;Investing in human resources for health;0.9532
839;White Paper by the European Society for Swallowing Disorders: Screening and Non-instrumental Assessment for Dysphagia in Adults;10.1007/s00455-021-10283-7;"This White Paper by the European Society for Swallowing Disorders (ESSD) reports on the current state of screening and non-instrumental assessment for dysphagia in adults. An overview is provided on the measures that are available, and how to select screening tools and assessments. Emphasis is placed on different types of screening, patient-reported measures, assessment of anatomy and physiology of the swallowing act, and clinical swallowing evaluation. Many screening and non-instrumental assessments are available for evaluating dysphagia in adults; however, their use may not be warranted due to poor diagnostic performance or lacking robust psychometric properties. This white paper provides recommendations on how to select best evidence-based screening tools and non-instrumental assessments for use in clinical practice targeting different constructs, target populations and respondents, based on criteria for diagnostic performance, psychometric properties (reliability, validity, and responsiveness), and feasibility. In addition, gaps in research that need to be addressed in future studies are discussed. The following recommendations are made: (1) discontinue the use of non-validated dysphagia screening tools and assessments; (2) implement screening using tools that have optimal diagnostic performance in selected populations that are at risk of dysphagia, such as stroke patients, frail older persons, patients with progressive neurological diseases, persons with cerebral palsy, and patients with head and neck cancer; (3) implement measures that demonstrate robust psychometric properties; and (4) provide quality training in dysphagia screening and assessment to all clinicians involved in the care and management of persons with dysphagia.";"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00455-021-10283-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787994/";31/03/2021;European Society for Swallowing Disorders;0.9067
840;Pregnant Patients Using Opioids: Treatment Access Barriers in the Age of COVID-19.;10.1097/adm.0000000000000826;OBJECTIVES Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many pregnant patients experienced barriers in accessing opioid use disorder (OUD) medication. This project surveyed buprenorphine treatment clinics to determine how many accepted pregnant women before and then during the pandemic. Of those clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic, respondents were asked what services were provided and what forms of payment they accepted. METHODS Between July and September 2020, phone contact was made with every sixth unduplicated clinic in North Carolina listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration treatment locator (N = 490 clinics). The response rate was 53%. RESULTS Of the 128 clinics responding, 62 clinics (48%) failed to treat pregnant patients both before and during the pandemic, whereas 66 clinics (52%) accepted pregnant patients before the COVID-19 pandemic, with only 44 (66%) of these clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic. Thus, 33% fewer clinics accepted pregnant women for OUD treatment. Of these 44 clinics, 52% provided same-day intake, 45% prescribed naltrexone, and 57% offered detoxification with opioid agonists. Self-pay (95%), private insurance (77%), and Medicaid (55%) were accepted as payment. Clinics commonly reported providing individual counseling (86%). No clinics provided childcare or transportation. CONCLUSIONS Almost half of the buprenorphine clinics in North Carolina turned away pregnant patients before the pandemic. During the pandemic, only 34% accepted pregnant patients, with 33% clinics that had provided medication treatment before the pandemic declining to treat pregnant patients for OUD. Thus, it is critical that policymakers ensure OUD treatment clinics accept pregnant patients.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606424/";17/02/2021;opioid use disorder;0.9608
841;Immuno-informatics approach for multi-epitope vaccine designing against SARS-CoV-2;10.1101/2020.07.23.218529;The novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread a blaze of increasing fatality rates across the world. The dearth of potential vaccines has left the survival of mankind with doubts. The development of multi-epitope vaccine in this current situation could be a possible COVID treatment. We have designed a novel multi-epitope, multi-protein vaccine with different proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus −2 (SARS-CoV-2) with immuno-informatics approaches, which has been validated in silico to be stable and potential. It has been prepared with Cytotoxic T-cell (T(C)) and Helper T-cell (T(H)) binding epitopes overlapping with B-cell binding epitopes predicted for 6 proteins conserved among 4 different viral strains isolated across the world. Both the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are ensured due to the presence of T cell and B-cell inducing epitopes along with interferon-gamma inducing epitopes present in the vaccine. The final vaccine construct comprises of an adjuvant at the N terminal, Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte and Helper T Lymphocyte epitopes. The construct showed potential antigenicity and was non-allergic. The molecular docking of the refined, validated tertiary structure model of the vaccine was performed with immune-stimulatory Toll Like Receptors (TLR), TLR-2,3,4. The study of binding energetics of the docked complexes revealed binding interactions of receptor with vaccine. The immune simulation of the vaccine even confirmed the initiation of elevated host immune responses. The efficient translation of the vaccine in an expression vector was confirmed with in silico cloning approach. Certainly, the development of such vaccine candidate could possibly be an effective therapy for COVID-19.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32743567/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.218529";24/07/2020;Corona Virus Disease;0.9912
842;What we know so far about Coronavirus Disease 2019 in children: A meta‐analysis of 551 laboratory‐confirmed cases;10.1002/ppul.24869;"AIM: To summarize what we know so far about coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) in children. METHOD: We searched PubMed, Scientific Electronic Library Online, and Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information from 1 January 2020 to 4 May 2020. We selected randomized trials, observational studies, case series or case reports, and research letters of children ages birth to 18 years with laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19. We conducted random‐effects meta‐analyses to calculate the weighted mean prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) or the weighted average means and 95% CI. RESULT: Forty‐six articles reporting 551 cases of COVID‐19 in children (aged 1 day‐17.5 years) were included. Eighty‐seven percent (95% CI: 77%‐95%) of patients had household exposure to COVID‐19. The most common symptoms and signs were fever (53%, 95% CI: 45%‐61%), cough (39%, 95% CI: 30%‐47%), and sore throat/pharyngeal erythema (14%, 95% CI: 4%‐28%); however, 18% (95% CI: 11%‐27%) of cases were asymptomatic. The most common radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings were patchy consolidations (33%, 95% CI: 23%‐43%) and ground glass opacities (28%, 95% CI: 18%‐39%), but 36% (95% CI: 28%‐45%) of patients had normal CT images. Antiviral agents were given to 74% of patients (95% CI: 52%‐92%). Six patients, all with major underlying medical conditions, needed invasive mechanical ventilation, and one of them died. CONCLUSION: Previously healthy children with COVID‐19 have mild symptoms. The diagnosis is generally suspected from history of household exposure to COVID‐19 case.

843;The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the perinatal mental health of women.;10.1515/jpm-2020-0415;"Short Communications The physical health impact of the coronavirus disease infection (COVID-19) has received attention worldwide; however, data around the psychological impact of the pandemic is still emerging and little has been reported on psychological effects among vulnerable groups. This study was undertaken with the aim of studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on perinatal mental health among women in Qatar. Objectives and Methods A cross- sectional survey of women accessing maternity services in Qatar was carried out during the months of June and July 2020 at the local peak of the pandemic. Background data including relevant demographic details, pregnancy and mental health history, concerns, as well as helpful stress-reducing factors reported by women was collected. Depression and anxiety symptomatology was studied using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results The survey results revealed a high prevalence of anxiety and Depressive symptomatology (34.4 and 39.2% respectively), based on PHQ-ADS scoring. These rates appeared much higher than the reported pre-pandemic prevalence and were not affected by occupation, previous mental health problems or pregnancy complications. Women's most commonly reported concerns as well as coping factors are discussed. Conclusions Results indicate a marked increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, among pregnant and puerperal individuals, who constitute a vulnerable group with respect to mental health morbidity. These findings can be used to inform public health interventions, among which, consideration should be given to routine mental health screening of vulnerable groups during major health crises.";"https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975206/";25/09/2020;coronavirus disease infection;0.9525
844;Early experience with critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Montreal;10.1007/s12630-020-01816-z;"PURPOSE: Montreal has been the epicentre of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Canada. Given the regional disparities in incidence and mortality in the general population, we aimed to describe local characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Montreal. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective cohort of consecutive adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal with confirmed COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Between 20 March and 13 May 2020, 75 patients were admitted, with a median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of 62 [53–72] yr and high rates of obesity (47%), hypertension (67%), and diabetes (37%). Healthcare-related infections were responsible for 35% of cases. The median [IQR] day 1 sequential organ failure assessment score was 6 [3–7]. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was used in 57% of patients for a median [IQR] of 11 [5–22] days. Patients receiving IMV were characterized by a moderately decreased median [IQR] partial pressure of oxygen:fraction of inspired oxygen (day 1 PaO(2):F(i)O(2) = 177 [138–276]; day 10 = 173 [147–227]) and compliance (day 1 = 48 [38–58] mL/cmH(2)O; day 10 = 34 [28–42] mL/cmH(2)O) and very elevated estimated dead space fraction (day 1 = 0.60 [0.53–0.67]; day 10 = 0.72 [0.69–0.79]). Overall hospital mortality was 25%, and 21% in the IMV patients. Mortality was 82% in patients ≥ 80 yr old. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Montreal were similar to those reported in the existing literature. We found an increased physiologic dead space, supporting the hypothesis that pulmonary vascular injury may be central to COVID-19-induced lung damage.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935329/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01816-z";15/09/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9428
845;BEHAVIORAL CHANGES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY IN SINGAPORE;10.1101/2020.08.06.20169870;Introduction: As part of infection control measures for COVID-19, individuals have been encouraged to adopt both preventive (e.g., handwashing) and avoidant behavioural changes (e.g., avoiding crowds). In this study, we examined whether demographics predicted the likelihood that a person would adopt these behaviours in Singapore. Materials and Methods: 1145 participants responded to an online survey conducted between 7 March - 21 April 2020. As part of the survey, we collected demographic information and asked participants to report which of 17 behaviour changes they had undertaken because of the outbreak. We ran regression models to predict, using demographic information: (1) the total number of behavioural changes undertaken, (2) the number of preventive changes undertaken, and (3) the number of avoidant changes undertaken. Finally, we sought to identify predictors of persons who: (4) declared that they had not undertaken any of these measures following the outbreak. Results: Females and those who were younger adopted more preventive behaviours: whereas females were more likely to increase handwashing frequency, younger individuals were more likely to wear face masks prior to legislation. Females and those who were married adopted more avoidant behaviours, with both groups avoiding crowded areas and staying home more than usual. Females also voluntarily reduced physical contact, whereas those who were married chose outdoor venues and relied on online shopping. Conclusion: Our characterisation of behavioural changes provides a baseline for public health advisories. Moving forward, local health authorities can focus their efforts to encourage segments of the population who do not readily adopt infection control measures against COVID-19.;"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.06.20169870v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.06.20169870";07/08/2020;infection control measures;0.9556

847;Cyclooxygenase inhibitor use is associated with increased COVID-19 severity;10.1101/2021.04.13.21255438;BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation but have been associated with complications in community acquired pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Conclusive data are not available about potential beneficial or adverse effects of COX inhibitors on COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multi-center observational study by leveraging the harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record data of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Potential associations of eight COX inhibitors with COVID-19 severity were assessed using ordinal logistic regression (OLR) on treatment with the medication in question after matching by treatment propensity as predicted by age, race, ethnicity, gender, smoking status, comorbidities, and BMI. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the correlation of medication use with morbidity for eight subcohorts defined by common indications for COX inhibitors. RESULTS: OLR revealed statistically significant associations between use of any of five COX inhibitors and increased severity of COVID-19. For instance, the odds ratio of aspirin use in the osteoarthritis cohort (n=2266 patients) was 3.25 (95% CI 2.76 – 3.83). Aspirin and acetaminophen were associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The association between use of COX inhibitors and COVID-19 severity was consistent across five COX inhibitors and multiple indication subcohorts. Our results align with earlier reports associating NSAID use with complications in RTI patients. Further research is needed to characterize the precise risk of individual COX inhibitors in COVID-19 patients.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907758/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255438; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.13.21255438v1?rss=1";20/04/2021;Cyclooxygenase;0.9153
848;Outcomes of non-invasive ventilation as the ceiling of treatment in patients with COVID-19.;10.23736/s0031-0808.21.04280-4;BACKGROUND Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is effective for symptom relief and respiratory support in patients with respiratory insufficiency, severe comorbidities and no indication to intubation. Experience with NIV as the ceiling of treatment in severely compromised novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients is lacking. METHODS We evaluated 159 patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), 38 of whom with NIV as the ceiling of treatment, admitted to an ordinary ward and treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and respiratory physiotherapy. Treatment failure and death were correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters in the whole cohort and in patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment. RESULTS Patients who had NIV as the ceiling of treatment were elderly, with a low BMI and a high burden of comorbidities, showed clinical and laboratory signs of multi-organ insufficiency on admission and of rapidly deteriorating vital signs during the first week of treatment. NIV failure occurred overall in 77 (48%) patients, and 27/38 patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment died. Congestive heart failure, chronic benign haematological diseases and inability/refusal to receive respiratory physiotherapy were independently associated to NIV failure and mortality. Need for increased positive end-expiratory pressures and low platelets were associated with NIV failure. Death was associated to cerebrovascular disease, need for CPAP cycles longer than 12h and, in the subgroup of patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment, was heralded by vital sign deterioration within 48 h.

849;Whole Genome Sequencing for Revealing the Point Mutations of SARS-CoV-2 Genome in Bangladeshi Isolates and their Structural Effects on Viral Proteins;10.1101/2020.12.05.413377;Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is the recent global pandemic caused by the virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has already killed more than one million people worldwide and billions are at risk of getting infected. As of now, there is neither any drug nor any vaccine in sight with conclusive scientific evidence that it can cure or provide protection against the illness. Since novel coronavirus is a new virus, mining its genome sequence is of crucial importance for drug/vaccine(s) development. Whole genome sequencing is a helpful tool in identifying genetic changes that occur in a virus when it spreads through the population. In this study, we performed complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to unveil the genomic variation and indel, if present. We discovered thirteen (13) mutations in Orf1ab, S and N gene where seven (7) of them turned out to be novel mutations from our sequenced isolate. Besides, we found one (1) insertion and seven (7) deletions from the indel analysis among the 323 Bangladeshi isolates. However, the indel did not show any effect on proteins. Our energy minimization analysis showed both stabilizing and destabilizing impact on viral proteins depending on the mutation. Interestingly, all the variants were located in the binding site of the proteins. Furthermore, drug binding analysis revealed marked difference in interacting residues in mutants when compared to the wild type. Our analysis also suggested that eleven (11) mutations could exert damaging effects on their corresponding protein structures. The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation and their impacts presented in this study might be helpful in gaining a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this deadly virus.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.05.413377;11/12/2020;Coronavirus disease-19;0.9925
850;Mental health, substance use, and suicidal ideation during a prolonged COVID-19–related lockdown in a region with low SARS-CoV-2 prevalence;10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.080;The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with mental health consequences due to direct (i.e., SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially due to neuronal or astrocytic infection, microvascular, or inflammatory mechanisms) and indirect (i.e., social and economic impacts of COVID-19 prevention measures) mechanisms. Investigation of mental health in a region with one of the longest lockdowns and lowest COVID-19 prevalence globally (Victoria, Australia) allowed for evaluation of mental health in the absence of direct pandemic mental health consequences. Surveys were administered during 15-24 September 2020 to Victorian residents aged ≥18 years for The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative. Responses were compared cross-sectionally with April-2020 data, and longitudinally among respondents who completed both surveys. Multivariable Poisson regressions were used to estimate prevalence ratios for adverse mental health symptoms, substance use, and suicidal ideation adjusted for demographics, sleep, and behaviours (e.g., screen-time, outdoor-time). In September-2020, among 1157 Victorians, one-third reported anxiety or depressive disorder symptoms, one-fifth reported suicidal ideation, and one-tenth reported having seriously considered suicide within 30 days. Young adults, unpaid caregivers, those with disabilities, and those with pre-existing psychiatric or sleep conditions showed increased prevalence of adverse mental health symptoms. Prevalence of symptoms of burnout, anxiety, and depressive disorder were unchanged between April-2020 and September-2020. Persistently common experiences of adverse mental health symptoms despite low SARS-CoV-2 prevalence during prolonged lockdown highlight the urgent need for mental health support services.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174556/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.080; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395621003563?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022395621003563";04/06/2021;Outbreak Public Evaluation;0.935
851;Forecasting COVID-19 cases: A comparative analysis between recurrent and convolutional neural networks;10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104137;Though many countries have already launched COVID-19 mass vaccination programs to control the disease outbreak quickly, numerous countries around worldwide are grappling with unprecedented surges of new COVID-19 cases due to a more contagious and deadly variant of coronavirus. As the number of new cases is skyrocketing, pandemic fatigue and public apathy towards different intervention strategies pose new challenges to government officials to combat the pandemic. Henceforth, it is indispensable for the government officials to understand the future dynamics of COVID-19 flawlessly to develop strategic preparedness and resilient response planning. In light of the above circumstances, probable future outbreak scenarios in Brazil, Russia, and the United kingdom have been sketched in this study with the help of four deep learning models: long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), convolutional neural network (CNN) and multivariate convolutional neural network (MCNN). In our analysis, the CNN algorithm has outperformed other deep learning models in terms of validation accuracy and forecasting consistency. It is unearthed in our study that CNN can provide robust long-term forecasting results in time-series analysis due to its capability of essential features learning, distortion invariance, and temporal dependence learning. However, the prediction accuracy of the LSTM algorithm has been found to be poor as it tries to discover seasonality and periodic intervals from any time-series dataset, which were absent in our studied countries. Our study has highlighted the promising validation of using convolutional neural networks instead of recurrent neural networks when forecasting with very few features and less amount of historical data.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379721002904; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898209/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211379721002904";19/04/2021;mass vaccination programs;0.9116

Thus, our aim was to assess, in a cohort of patients regularly followed up in a devoted outpatient clinic of Southern Italy, the association between their gastrointestinal symptoms changes, stress, and anxiety reported during the Italian lockdown. METHODS: We recruited patients from the outpatient clinic of the University of Salerno, devoted to functional gastrointestinal disorders, selecting only patients for whom an evaluation was available in the last 6 months before the lockdown. Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated at each visit through standardized questionnaire and pooled in a database. On 45th days from the beginning of the lockdown, patients were re‐assessed by phone with the same questionnaire. Anxiety and stress levels were assessed through a self‐administered online questionnaire based on Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 test and Perceived Stress Scale 10 test. KEY RESULTS: The intensity‐frequency scores of several upper gastrointestinal symptoms improved (Wilcoxon test <0.05). Higher anxiety levels had a higher risk of worsening chest pain (OR 1.3 [1.1–1.7]), waterbrash (OR 1.3 [1.0–1.7]), epigastric burning (OR 1.3 [1.0–1.6]), and abdominal pain (OR 1.6 [1.0–2.3]). When compared to the interval preceding the outbreak, half of the patients declared their symptoms remained unchanged, 13.6% worsened, and 36.4% improved. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: During the COVID‐19 quarantine, there was an improvement of the majority of upper gastrointestinal symptoms in our patients, and anxiety seems an important risk of worsening few of them.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550640/; https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14092";07/02/2021;Psychological stress and anxiety;0.9348
853;Aortic volume determines global end-diastolic volume measured by transpulmonary thermodilution;10.1186/s40635-019-0284-8;BACKGROUND: Global end-diastolic volume (GEDV) measured by transpulmonary thermodilution is regarded as indicator of cardiac preload. A bolus of cold saline injected in a central vein travels through the heart and lung, but also the aorta until detection in a femoral artery. While it is well accepted that injection in the inferior vena cava results in higher values, the impact of the aortic volume on GEDV is unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that a larger aortic volume directly translates to a numerically higher GEDV measurement. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 88 critically ill patients with thermodilution monitoring and who did require a contrast-enhanced thoraco-abdominal computed tomography scan. Aortic volumes derived from imaging were compared with GEDV measurements in temporal proximity. RESULTS: Median aortic volume was 194 ml (interquartile range 147 to 249 ml). Per milliliter increase of the aortic volume, we found a GEDV increase by 3.0 ml (95% CI 2.0 to 4.1 ml, p < 0.001). In case a femoral central venous line was used for saline bolus injection, GEDV raised additionally by 2.1 ml (95% CI 0.5 to 3.7 ml, p = 0.01) per ml volume of the vena cava inferior. Aortic volume explained 59.3% of the variance of thermodilution-derived GEDV. When aortic volume was included in multivariate regression, GEDV variance was unaffected by sex, age, body height, and weight. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the aortic volume is a substantial confounding variable for GEDV measurements performed with transpulmonary thermodilution. As the aorta is anatomically located after the heart, GEDV should not be considered to reflect cardiac preload. Guiding volume management by raw or indexed reference ranges of GEDV may be misleading.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6940405/;02/01/2020;Global end-diastolic volume;0.9729
854;Coping under stress: Prefrontal control predicts stress burden during the COVID-19 crisis;10.1101/2021.06.28.21259570;Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has confronted millions of people around the world with an unprecedented stressor, affecting physical and mental health. Accumulating evidence suggests that emotional and cognitive self-regulation is particularly needed to effectively cope with stress. Therefore, we investigated the predictive value of affective and inhibitory prefrontal control for stress burden during the COVID-19 crisis. Method: Physical and mental health burden were assessed using an online survey, which was administered to 104 participants of an ongoing German at-risk birth cohort during the first wave in April 2020. Two follow-ups were carried out during the pandemic, one capturing the relaxation during summer and the other the beginning of the second wave of the crisis. Prefrontal activity during emotion regulation and inhibitory control were assessed prior to the COVID-19 crisis. Results: Increased inferior frontal gyrus activity during emotion regulation predicted lower stress burden at the beginning of the first and the second wave of the crisis. In contrast, inferior and medial frontal gyrus activity during inhibitory control predicted effective coping only during the summer, when infection rates decreased but stress burden remained unchanged. These findings remained significant when controlling for sociodemographic and clinical confounders such as stressful life events prior to the crisis or current psychopathology. Conclusions: We demonstrate that differential stress-buffering effects are predicted by the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation and cognitive regulation at different stages during the pandemic. These findings may inform future prevention strategies to foster stress coping in unforeseen situations.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259570; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.21259570v1?rss=1";02/07/2021;coronavirus;0.9225
855;Overview of e-Health initiatives in Rajasthan: An exploratory study;10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1989_20;BACKGROUND: Government of Rajasthan has undertaken a series of e-Health initiatives, especially under various programs of National Health Mission in the past few years. There is a paucity of studies which document and provide appraisal of these initiatives in Rajasthan. AIM: To document ongoing e-Health Initiatives based on technologies and approaches used, coverage by the region and population, services provided and scope. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary data collection in form of key-informant interviews while secondary data collection in form of internet-based search of peer and non-peer reviewed literature was conducted to achieve the study objectives. Appropriate documents, records, and reports were reviewed to ensure that all necessary information was obtained. RESULTS: A total of 13 e-Health initiatives were included in the study. The e-Health programs were classified with the use of WHO's classification of Digital Health Interventions v1.0. Most of the initiatives perceived in the study were found to be beneficial to the community, covering the entire population targeted. Supporting agencies, technologies used, and challenges faced during the implementation were identified and documented. Lack of trained manpower, technical and software glitches and deficiency of awareness activities were few obstacles that were found consistent across all user groups. CONCLUSIONS: The overview from this study augmented the knowledge about further scopes and sustainability of these initiatives. Deploying dedicated professionals may improve the functioning of these initiatives. Since e-Health interventions significantly influence healthcare systems, further scale-up of such studies with appropriate evaluation should be planned to guide policy decisions.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8140245/;08/04/2021;Government of Rajasthan;0.9328
856;Clinical and microbiological assessments of COVID-19 in healthcare workers: a prospective longitudinal study;10.1101/2020.11.04.20225862;"BackgroundA comprehensive assessment of COVID-19 in healthcare workers (HCWs) including the investigation of viral shedding duration is critical. MethodsA longitudinal study including 319 HCWs was conducted. After SARS-CoV-2 screening with RT-PCR assay, other respiratory pathogens were tested with a multiplex molecular panel. For SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs, the normalized viral load was determined weekly; viral culture and virus neutralization assays were also performed. For 190 HCWs tested negative, SARS-CoV-2 serological testing was performed one month after the inclusion. FindingsOf the 319 HCWs included, 67 (21.0%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; two of them developed severe COVID-19. The proportion of smell and taste dysfunction was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs than in negative ones (38.8% vs 9.5% and 37.3% vs 10.7%, respectively, p<0.001). Of the 67 positive patients, 9.1% were tested positive for at least another respiratory pathogen (vs 19.5%, p=0.07). The proportion of HCWs with a viral load > 5.0 log10 cp/ml (Ct value <25) was less than 15% at 8 days after symptom onset; 12% of them were still positive after 40 days (Ct >37). More than 90% of culturable virus had a viral load > 4.5 log10 cp/ml (Ct < 26) and were collected within 10 days after symptom onset. From HCWs tested negative, 6/190 (3.2%) exhibited seroconversion for IgG antibodies. InterpretationOur data suggest that the determination of normalized viral load (or its estimation through Ct values) can be useful for discontinuing isolation of HCWs and facilitating their safe return to work. HCWs presenting mild COVID-19 are unlikely infectious 10 days after symptom onset.

857;Engineered CRISPR/Cas12a Enables Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Detection;10.1101/2020.12.23.20248725;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has swept through the globe at an unprecedented rate. CRISPR-based detection technologies such as DETECTR, SHERLOCK, and STOPCovid have emerged as a rapid and affordable platform that can shape the future of diagnostics. Recently, we reported engineered crRNAs for Cas12a, called ENHANCE, that enables enhanced detection of nucleic acids. Here we report development, clinical validation, and advancement of ENHANCE platform for detecting SARS-CoV-2. With an RT-LAMP pre-amplification step, ENHANCE detects samples down to a single copy with 95% accuracy and shows high specificity towards various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 against 31 highly similar and common respiratory pathogens. Utilizing LbCas12a-mediated trans-cleavage activity, ENHANCE works robustly in a wide range of magnesium concentration (3 mM-13 mM), allowing for further assay optimization. Additionally, ENHANCEv2 is developed to further improve the previously reported ENHANCE. ENHANCEv2 employs mutated LbCas12aD156R, engineered chimeric DNA-extended crRNA, and a dual reporter for both fluorescence-based reporter assay and lateral flow assay. Both ENHANCE and ENHANCEv2 are validated in 62 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, showing 60/62 (96.7%) agreement with RT-qPCR results, and using only 5 L of sample and 20 minutes of CRISPR reaction. Lateral flow assay on paper strips displays 100% agreement with fluorescence-based reporter assay in the clinical validation. Following a 30-minute pre-amplification RT-LAMP step, the lyophilized ENHANCEv2 is shown to achieve high sensitivity and specificity while reducing CRISPR reaction time to as low as 3 minutes and maintaining its detection capability upon storage at room temperature for several weeks.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248725; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248725v1?rss=1";24/12/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9723
858;Altered Influenza Vaccination Coverage and Related Factors in Pregnant Women in Korea from 2007 to 2019;10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e42;BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are at a high-risk of influenza infection. We have previously reported a low influenza vaccination coverage rate (4.0%) in Korea during the 2006–2007 influenza season. We conducted follow-up studies in 2011–2012 and 2018–2019 to observe changes in influenza vaccination coverage. METHODS: Women who delivered at Inha University Hospital (Incheon, Korea) in 2011–2012 and 2018–2019 were enrolled in the study. We surveyed the rate of influenza vaccination, perception scores, and related factors through telephonic interviews and compared the results from 2011–2012 and 2018–2019 with those from 2006–2007. RESULTS: The number of survey respondents was 227 in 2006–2007, 152 in 2011–2012, and 171 in 2018–2019. The rate of vaccination coverage increased from 4.0% in 2006–2007 to 42.0% in 2011–2012 and 59.3% in 2018–2019. Perception scores also increased progressively from 3.8 in 2006–2007 to 4.2 in 2011–2012 and 5.1 in 2018–2019. Physician recommendations for influenza vaccination also increased from 4.8% in 2006–2007 to 36.8% in 2011–2012 and 49.7% in 2018–2019. The most common reason for not getting vaccinated was the lack of awareness of influenza vaccination during pregnancy (36.9%). The perception scores and physician recommendation rates were significantly lower for unvaccinated women (3.87 and 8.4%, respectively) than for vaccinated women (5.14 and 69.1%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The influenza vaccination coverage rate in pregnant women has increased significantly since our study in 2006–2007. However, further improvement in the coverage rate is needed. There is a need for active and comprehensive publicity and education regarding this issue among physicians and pregnant women.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527784/; https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e42";18/01/2021;49.7%;0.9629
859;The effect of positive end-expiratory pressure on cardiac output and oxygen delivery during cardiopulmonary resuscitation;10.1186/s40635-020-00330-2;BACKGROUND: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used to optimize oxygenation by preventing alveolar collapse. However, PEEP can potentially decrease cardiac output through cardiopulmonary interactions. The effect of PEEP on cardiac output during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is not known. METHODS: This was a preclinical randomized, controlled, animal study conducted in an animal research facility on 25 Landrace-Yorkshire pigs. After inducing cardiac arrest, CPR was performed with LUCAS 3. During CPR, pigs were ventilated at a PEEP of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 cmH(2)O (randomly determined via lottery) for 9 min. Cardiac output, obtained via ultrasound dilution, and PaO(2) were measured, and oxygen delivery calculated for each PEEP. RESULTS: A mixed-effects repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the baseline value adjusted mean cardiac output, PaO(2), and oxygen delivery between PEEP groups. Least significant difference test was used to conduct pairwise comparisons between PEEP groups. To determine optimum PEEP, Gaussian mixture model was applied to the adjusted means of cardiac output and oxygen delivery. Increasing PEEP to 10 and higher resulted in significant declines in cardiac output. A PEEP of 15 and higher resulted in significant declines in oxygen delivery. As PEEP was increased from 0 to 20, PaO(2) increased significantly. Gaussian mixture model identified the 0–5 PEEP group as providing optimal cardiac output and oxygen delivery, with PEEP of 5 providing the highest oxygen delivery. CONCLUSIONS: A PEEP of 0–5 resulted in the optimal oxygen delivery and cardiac output during CPR, with PEEP of 5 resulting in higher oxygen delivery, and a slightly lower, statistically insignificant cardiac output than PEEP of 0.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7382317/;25/07/2020;Positive end-expiratory pressure;0.9342
860;Healthcare workers’ sleep and mood disturbances during COVID-19 outbreak in an Iranian referral center;10.1007/s11325-021-02312-4;"PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the frequency of sleep and mood disturbances, and their association with COVID-like symptoms in healthcare workers (HCWs) with and without positive Coronavirus RT-PCR in a corona referral center. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional, anonymous survey of adult HCWs. Data collection was performed in May and June 2020, while governmental restrictions were in place. The participants completed the forms including six separate parts: personal and occupational information, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient’s Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and COVID-like symptoms and Coronavirus RT-PCR status. RESULTS: Among the 372 HCW participants, 245 (66%) were women and mean age was 34.5 ± 7.1 years (age range 23 to 58). The mean scores of all questionnaires except ISI were significantly higher in the HCWs with positive Coronavirus RT-PCR than another group (PSQI, 9 ± 3.4 vs. 6.9 ± 3.1; GAD-7, 9.8 ± 3.6 vs. 7.9 ± 5.3; PHQ-9, 12.8 ± 6.1 vs. 9.5 ± 6.4, P < 0.05; and ISI, 13.8 ± 5.3 vs. 12.3 ± 6 P = 0.163). Positive association between COVID-like symptoms and sleep and mood disturbances was found in the group without a positive test result. Analysis of questionnaires showed higher scores in the group directly involved except for ISI (P < 0.001 and P = 0.053 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the HCWs in this sample experienced a high rate of sleep and mood disturbances. There was also a strong association between sleep and mood disturbances and COVID-like symptoms in the group without a positive RT-PCR result. With all this considered, effective psychological support for HCWs during crisis seems to be necessary.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33580842/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-021-02312-4";13/02/2021;healthcare workers;0.9088
861;Associations between movement behaviors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile;10.1101/2021.02.09.21251387;BackgroundThere is limited evidence about emotional and behavioral responses in toddlers and preschoolers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, particularly in Latin America. ObjectiveTo assess associations between changes in movement behaviors (physical activity, screen time and sleeping) and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the pandemic in Chile. MethodsA cross-sectional study conducted from March 30th to April 27th, 2020. Main caregivers of 1-to 5-year-old children living in Chile answered an online survey that included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, changes in the childs emotions and behaviors, movement behaviors and caregivers stress during the pandemic. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the association between different factors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers. ResultsIn total, 1727 caregivers provided complete data on emotional changes for children aged 2.9{+/-}1.36 years old, 47.9% girls. A large proportion of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile experienced emotional and behavioral changes. Most caregivers reported that children were more affectionate (78.9%), more restless (65.1%), and more frustrated (54.1%) compared with pre-pandemic times. Apart from changes in movement behaviors, factors such as child age, caregivers age and stress, and residential area (urban/rural) were consistently associated with changes in emotions and behaviors. ConclusionThe pandemic substantially affected the emotions and behaviors of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile. Mental health promotion programs should consider multilevel approaches in which the promotion of movement behaviors and support for caregivers should be essential pieces for future responses.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.09.21251387; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251387v1?rss=1";15/02/2021;coronavirus disease;0.9921
862;The impact of frailty on trauma outcomes using the Clinical Frailty Scale;10.1007/s00068-021-01627-x;"BACKGROUND: Population ageing is a worldwide phenomenon; thanks to improvements in medical care and living standards. The Office of National Statistics in the UK predicts that the fastest growing age group in coming decades will be those over 85 years. This is reflected in Trauma Audit and Research Network data, which has highlighted a shift in caseload from a majority of young males to elderly patients at UK Major Trauma Centres (MTC). This study of elderly trauma patients admitted to a UK MTC reviews the links between frailty, using the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), and outcomes from trauma. METHODS: A retrospective database review of patients > 65 years old admitted to our MTC was performed. We identified 1125 eligible patients of which 729 had a recorded CFS. Those without a CFS were omitted. The primary outcome measured was in-hospital mortality. Secondary measures were Injury Severity Score, length of stay, trauma team activation on arrival and discharge destination. Multivariate regression analyses were performed using STATA v 15. RESULTS: Those of CFS 5–9 (frail) were 2.6 times more likely to die than the CFS 1–4 (pre-frail) (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.47–4.78). The frail group was also 56% less likely to have a trauma call on admission (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30–0.65) and 61% less likely to be discharged to their usual place of residence (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28–0.55). CONCLUSION: We advocate the use of the Clinical Frailty Scale as a screening tool for frailty in trauma patients, highlighting those at risk of increased length of stay and mortality, subsequently assisting healthcare providers with setting realistic expectations with family members.

863;Continuous quality improvement in HIV and TB services at selected healthcare facilities in South Africa;10.4102/sajhivmed.v22i1.1202;BACKGROUND: Continuous quality improvement (CQI) is essential for HIV and tuberculosis (TB) services. Similarly, a thorough understanding of the requirements and impact of CQI is critical to its successful institutionalisation. However, this is currently lacking. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to describe the CQI implementation process and examine its effect on HIV and TB service delivery at selected primary healthcare facilities in two South African districts. METHOD: We used a separate sample, pre- and post-test, quasi-experimental study design based on data collected from the clinical audit of patient cohorts seen in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Quality was measured based on the extent to which prescribed services were provided. Tailored CQI interventions were implemented based on service delivery gaps identified by the 2014 CQI audit. Data were summarised and analysed using a combination of univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The services identified as low quality were related to opportunistic infections management and laboratory practices. Compliance to prescribed service items in antiretroviral treatment initiation and monitoring, pharmacy and laboratory management, exceeded 70% across study sites. Over 80% of low quality service delivery items were optimised in less than six months with targeted quality improvement support. CONCLUSION: The observed improvements signal the effectiveness of the CQI approach, its capacity to rapidly improve under-performance, its high replicability and the need to provide quality maintenance support to sustain or improve healthcare facilities performing well. The study strongly underscores the need to improve the management of opportunistic infections and complications, particularly TB.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182456/;12/05/2021;Continuous quality improvement;0.9193
864;COVID-19 risk management at the workplace, fear of infection and fear of transmission of infection among frontline employees.;10.1136/oemed-2020-106831;OBJECTIVES We compared COVID-19 risk management, fear of infection and fear of transmission of infection among frontline employees working within eldercare, hospital/rehabilitation, psychiatry, childcare and ambulance service and explored if group differences in fear of infection and transmission could be explained by differences in risk management. We also investigated the association of risk management with fear of infection and fear of transmission of infection among eldercare personnel. METHODS We used cross-sectional questionnaire data collected by the Danish labour union, FOA . Data were collected 5½ weeks after the first case of COVID-19 was registered in Denmark. Data for the first aim included 2623 participants. Data for the second aim included 1680 participants. All independent variables were mutually adjusted and also adjusted for sex, age, job title and region. RESULTS Fear of infection (49%) and fear of transmitting infection from work to the private sphere (68%) was most frequent in ambulance service. Fear of transmitting infection during work was most frequent in the eldercare (55%). Not all differences in fear of infection and transmission between the five areas of work were explained by differences in risk management. Among eldercare personnel, self-reported exposure to infection and lack of access to test was most consistently associated with fear of infection and fear of transmission, whereas lack of access to personal protective equipment was solely associated with fear of transmission. CONCLUSION We have illustrated differences and similarities in COVID-19 risk management within five areas of work and provide new insights into factors associated with eldercare workers' fear of infection and fear of transmission of infection.;"https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2020-106831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077432/";19/10/2020;risk management;0.9224
865;[ANMCO Position paper: Pulmonary circulation diseases and COVID-19].;10.1714/3405.33888;"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is causing hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, is complex and can present with a multi-organ localization. One of its worst complications is an interstitial pneumonia with acute respiratory failure also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which requires non-invasive or invasive ventilation. A severe coagulopathy with poor prognosis is found in 5-10% of cases. SARS-CoV-2 is manifesting as a multi-dimensional disease and, recently, unique co-existing pathophysiological and clinical aspects are being defined: (i) an increased immune and inflammatory response with the activation of a cytokine storm and consequent coagulopathy, which promote both venous thromboembolic events and in situ thrombosis localized in small arterioles and pulmonary alveolar capillaries; (ii) a high intrapulmonary shunt, which often accounts for the severity of respiratory failure, due to reduced hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with pulmonary neo-angiogenetic phenomena. Furthermore, the high incidence of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit and the autoptic findings of in situ micro-thrombosis at the pulmonary vascular level, suggest that in this disease coagulopathy, unlike septic disseminated intravascular coagulation, is driven towards a hyper-thrombogenic state, giving rise to a debate (with ongoing studies) about the preventive use of anticoagulant doses of heparin to reduce mortality. The aim of this position paper from the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO) is to highlight the main implications that COVID-19 infection has on the pulmonary circulation from a pathophysiological, clinical and management point of view.";"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32686781/; https://doi.org/10.1714/3405.33888";01/08/2020;venous thromboembolism;0.926

Methods: We described all adult discharges from inpatient medical services and medical-surgical intensive care units (ICU) between November 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 at 7 hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario. We compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19, influenza and all other conditions using multivariable regression models controlling for patient age, sex, comorbidity, and residence in long-term-care. Results: There were 43,462 discharges in the study period, including 1,027 (3.0%) with COVID-19 and 783 (2.3%) with influenza. Patients with COVID-19 had similar age to patients with influenza and other conditions (median age 65 years vs. 68 years and 68 years, respectively, SD<0.1). Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (59.1%) and 11.7% were long-term care residents. Patients younger than 50 years accounted for 21.2% of all admissions for COVID-19 and 24.0% of ICU admissions. Compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 had significantly greater mortality (unadjusted 19.9% vs 6.1%, aRR: 3.47, 95%CI: 2.57, 4.67), ICU use (unadjusted 26.4% vs 18.0%, aRR 1.52, 95%CI: 1.27, 1.83) and hospital length-of-stay (unadjusted median 8.7 days vs 4.8 days, aRR: 1.40, 95%CI: 1.20, 1.64), and not significantly different 30-day readmission (unadjusted 8.6% vs 8.2%, aRR: 1.01, 95%CI: 0.72, 1.42). Interpretation: Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic used substantial hospital resources and suffered high mortality.

867;Obesity Intervention Improves Outcomes in Socially Isolated Older Adults: Progress Despite a Pandemic;10.1093/geroni/igaa057.3488;"The extended social isolation necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic will likely have a prolonged negative impact on the health of community-dwelling older adults. We studied the potential to counteract these negative effects, examining the before and after measurements of participants in two obesity intervention studies that were converted from in-person to remote delivery, due to COVID-19. The Veterans Achieving Weight Loss and Optimizing Resilience-Using Protein study (VALOR-UP; n=9) and the Egg-Supplemented Pre-Diabetes Intervention Trial (EGGSPDITE; n=6) enrolled obese (BMI = 34.2±3.8 kg/m2) older adults (age = 71.5±4.5 yrs; 80% male; 47% black) with prediabetes (fasting blood glucose 100-125 mg/dL and/or HbA1c of 5.7-6.4%). Participants followed a hypocaloric diet, attended weekly support groups, and weighed themselves weekly; VALOR-UP participants also attended a weekly exercise class delivered remotely. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (pre-COVID) and the end of a 4-month period coinciding with stay-at-home orders. Between baseline and 4 months, calorie intakes (3-day diet record) decreased by 402.1±529.3 kcal/day (p<0.05) and body weight by 6% (6.1±3.4 kg; p<0.0001). Physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery) improved by 1.1±1.4 units (p<0.01) and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical and mental composite quality of life remained stable (p=0.63 and p=0.48, respectively). Thus, despite COVID-19 circumstances, most participants were able to benefit from an intervention to improve function and reduce obesity. The somewhat surprising findings for this small cohort offer promise not only for future lifestyle interventions during COVID-19 isolation but also for other isolated populations, including home-bound older adults.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741496/;16/12/2020;baseline;0.9946
868;The procoagulant pattern of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome.;10.1111/jth.14854;BACKGROUND Few observations exist with respect to the pro-coagulant profile of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Reports of thromboembolic complications are scarce but suggestive for a clinical relevance of the problem. OBJECTIVES Prospective observational study aimed to characterize the coagulation profile of COVID-19 ARDS patients with standard and viscoelastic coagulation tests, and to evaluate their changes after establishment of an aggressive thromboprophylaxis. METHODS Sixteen patients with COVID-19 ARDS received a complete coagulation profile at the admission in the intensive care unit. Ten patients were followed in the subsequent 7 days, after increasing the dose of low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin levels correction, and clopidogrel in selected cases. RESULTS At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95% interquartile range 35-63), platelet contribution to CS (PCS, 43 hPa, interquartile range 24-45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa, interquartile range 6-13.5 elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 μg/mL, interquartile range 2.5-6.5), hyperfibrinogenemia (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583-933). Fibrinogen levels were associated (R2 =0.506, P=0.003) with interleukin-6 values. After increasing the thromboprophylaxis, there was a significant (P=0.001) time-related decrease of fibrinogen levels, D-dimers (P=0.017), CS (P=0.013), PCS (P=0.035) and FCS (P=0.038). CONCLUSION The pro-coagulant pattern of these patients may justify the clinical reports of thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism) during the course of the disease. Further studies are needed to assess the best prophylaxis and treatment of this condition.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302448/";17/04/2020;acute respiratory distress syndrome;0.9155
869;Role of ILC2 in Viral-Induced Lung Pathogenesis;10.3389/fimmu.2021.675169;Innate lymphoid type-2 cells (ILC2) are a population of innate cells of lymphoid origin that are known to drive strong Type 2 immunity. ILC2 play a key role in lung homeostasis, repair/remodeling of lung structures following injury, and initiation of inflammation as well as more complex roles during the immune response, including the transition from innate to adaptive immunity. Remarkably, dysregulation of this single population has been linked with chronic lung pathologies, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrotic diseases (IPF). Furthermore, ILC2 have been shown to increase following early-life respiratory viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV), that may lead to long-term alterations of the lung environment. The detrimental roles of increased ILC2 following these infections may include pathogenic chronic inflammation and/or alterations of the structural, repair, and even developmental processes of the lung. Respiratory viral infections in older adults and patients with established chronic pulmonary diseases often lead to exacerbated responses, likely due to previous exposures that leave the lung in a dysregulated functional and structural state. This review will focus on the role of ILC2 during respiratory viral exposures and their effects on the induction and regulation of lung pathogenesis. We aim to provide insight into ILC2-driven mechanisms that may enhance lung-associated diseases throughout life. Understanding these mechanisms will help identify better treatment options to limit not only viral infection severity but also protect against the development and/or exacerbation of other lung pathologies linked to severe respiratory viral infections.;"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.675169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953732/";19/04/2021;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;0.9798
870;Pulmonary Endothelial Dysfunction and Thrombotic Complications in Patients with COVID-19;10.1165/rcmb.2020-0359ps;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new strain of a Coronaviridae virus that presents 79% genetic similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, has been recently recognized as the cause of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, implying a major threat to world public health. SARS-CoV-2 infects host human cells by binding through the viral spike proteins to the ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, fuses with the cell membrane, enters, and starts its replication process to multiply its viral load. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was initially considered a respiratory infection that could cause pneumonia. However, in severe cases, it extends beyond the respiratory system and becomes a multiorgan disease. This transition from localized respiratory infection to multiorgan disease is due to two main complications of COVID-19. On the one hand, it is due to the so-called cytokine storm: an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction of the immune system in which defensive molecules become aggressive for the body itself. On the other hand, it is due to the formation of a large number of thrombi that can cause myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. The pulmonary endothelium actively participates in these two processes, becoming the last barrier before the virus spreads throughout the body. In this review, we examine the role of the pulmonary endothelium in response to COVID-19, the existence of potential biomarkers, and the development of novel therapies to restore vascular homeostasis and to protect and/or treat coagulation, thrombosis patients. In addition, we review the thrombotic complications recently observed in patients with COVID-19 and its potential threatening sequelae.;"https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2020-0359ps; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180562/";05/04/2021;Coronavirus disease;0.9273
871;Diagnostic performance of nucleic acid tests in tuberculous pleurisy;10.1186/s12879-020-04974-z;BACKGROUND: Tuberculous pleurisy (TBP) is the most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB). However, rapid diagnostic methods with high accuracy for tuberculous pleurisy are urgently needed. In the present study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF, LAMP and SAT-TB assay with pleural fluids from culture-positive TBP patients. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with exudative pleural effusions used as the samples for Xpert MTB/RIF, LAMP and SAT-TB assay. Of these, 265 including 223 patients diagnosed with TBP and 42 non-TBP patients used as controls were analyzed. RESULTS: The sensitivities of Xpert MTB/RIF (27.4%), LAMP (26.5%) and SAT-TB assay (32.3%) were significantly higher than that of pleural effusion smear (14.3%, X(2) = 20.65, P < 0.001), whereas they were much lower than expected for the analysis of pleural effusion samples. Both SAT-TB assay and Xpert MTB/RIF demonstrated high specificities (100%) and PPVs (100%), but the NPVs of all of the tests were < 22%. The area under ROC curve of pleural effusion smear, LAMP, Xpert MTB/RIF and SAT-TB assays was 0.524 (95% CI 0.431–0.617), 0.632 (95% CI 0.553–0.71), 0.637 (95% CI 0.56–0.714) and 0.673 (95% CI 0.6–0.745). SAT-TB assays had the highest AUC. CONCLUSION: Nucleic acid amplification tests are not the first choice in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. In this type of test, SAT-TB is recommended because of its low cost, relatively more accurate compared with the other two tests. This prospective study was approved by The Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital (approval number: K19–148).

872;Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress, mood, and substance use among young adults in the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul area: Findings from project EAT.;10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113826;RATIONALE There is a need to understand how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental and behavioral health of young adults in the U.S. OBJECTIVE This study used quantitative and qualitative survey data to identify young adults at highest risk for psychological distress during the U.S. outbreak of COVID-19 and to further understand how the pandemic has impacted their stress, mood, and substance use. METHODS Participants were 670 young adult cohort members (ages 21-29) of the population-based longitudinal study EAT 2010-2018 who participated in the C-EAT study (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time). RESULTS Among the sample, 84% (n = 561) reported pandemic-related changes to their mood or stress and 33% (n = 221) reported changes to their substance use. Linear regression analyses identified several meaningful risk factors for higher psychological distress during the pandemic, including female gender, White race, higher pre-pandemic depressive symptoms and perceived stress, and lower pre-pandemic stress management ability. A thematic analysis further identified five major themes related to changes in stress and mood following the COVID-19 outbreak describing specific emotional reactions, stress related to the direct impact of the pandemic as well as interpersonal connectedness and economic factors, and strategies for managing stress. In addition, two major themes were identified related to substance use during the pandemic detailing specific changes in and motivations for substance use. CONCLUSIONS These findings underscore the need to develop effective, scalable, and rapidly deployable public health resources that target the stressors commonly experienced among young adults to improve their psychological wellbeing during this pandemic.;"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743209/";06/03/2021;management ability;0.9618
873;Screening and Testing Pregnant Patients for SARS-CoV-2: First Wave Experience of a Designated COVID-19 Hospitalization Centre in Montreal;10.1016/j.jogc.2020.11.001;OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may present asymptomatically in a large proportion of cases in endemic areas. Accordingly, universal testing has been suggested as a potential strategy for reducing transmission in the obstetrical setting. We describe the clinical characteristics of patients who tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy at a designated COVID-19 hospitalization centre in Montreal, Quebec. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective cohort was constructed to include all pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 22 and July 31, 2020, and received care at the Jewish General Hospital. Initially, testing was restricted to at-risk patients, identified through the use of a screening questionnaire. Beginning on May 15, 2020, universal testing was implemented, and all pregnant patients admitted to hospital were tested. Data were collected through chart review. RESULTS: Of 803 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period, 41 (5%) tested positive. Among those patients who were symptomatic, the most commonly reported symptoms were cough (53%), fever (37%), dyspnea (30%), and anosmia and/or ageusia (20%). Prior to the implementation of universal testing, 13% (3/24) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic. Following the implementation of universal testing, 80% (8/10) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that most pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms of COVID-19. Particularly in endemic areas, universal testing of pregnant patients presenting to hospital should be strongly considered as an important measure to prevent in-hospital and community transmission of COVID-19.;"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S170121632030880X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S170121632030880X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2020.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33358711/";05/11/2020;Coronavirus Disease 2019;0.9221
874;Early respiratory outcomes following cardiac surgery in patients with COVID‐19;10.1111/jocs.14915;BACKGROUND: Both coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) and cardiac surgery have a negative impact on pulmonary function. This study aimed to determine the postoperative respiratory outcomes of patients with COVID‐19 who underwent cardiac surgery. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed and analyzed the patient characteristics and clinical data of 25 asymptomatic patients with COVID‐19 who underwent urgent or emergency cardiac surgery at Tehran Heart Center Hospital, Iran, between 29 February and 10 April 2020. RESULTS: The mean age, EuroSCORE, and body mass index were 57.3 ± 15.1 years, 6.65 ± 1.29, and 25.7 ± 3.7 kg/m(2), respectively. Four patients underwent off‐pump cardiac surgery and 21 underwent on‐pump cardiac surgery with a median cardiopulmonary bypass time of 85 minutes (interquartile range (IQR, 50‐147). The overall mortality rate and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) were higher compared to those of a propensity‐matched group of patients who underwent cardiac surgery in the pre‐COVID era. The median intubation time was 13 hours (IQR, 9.5‐18), which was comparable to that of pre‐COVID cardiac surgery patients. The readmission rate to the ICU was 16%. In this ICU readmitted group, the mean oxygen index, FiO(2), and mortality rate were higher and the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was lower than those of the nonreadmitted patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although early respiratory outcomes of asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients who underwent early cardiac surgery appeared to be satisfactory, compared to the propensity‐scored matched non‐COVID group, the postoperative outcomes were worse, especially in the ICU readmitted patients. We suggest postponing cardiac operations unless the patient requires emergency surgery.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789988/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14915";13/08/2020;cardiac surgery;0.9899
875;COVID-19 in age-related neurodegenerative diseases: is there a role for vitamin D3 as a possible therapeutic strategy?;10.1515/revneuro-2020-0074;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), identified in Wuhan, China, on December 2019, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on March, 2020. Since then, efforts have been gathered to describe its clinical course and to determine preventive measures and treatment strategies. Adults older than 65 years of age are more susceptible to serious clinical symptoms and present higher mortality rates. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a major receptor for some coronavirus infection, including SARS-COV-2, but is also a crucial determinant in anti-inflammation processes during the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) functioning - converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7. The decline in ACE2 expression that occurs with aging has been associated to the higher morbidity and mortality rates in older adults. These observations highlight the importance of investigating the association between COVID-19 and age-related neurodegenerative disorders, i.e., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. A possible option to reduce the risk of COVID-19 is vitamin D supplementation, due to its anti-inflammatory and immune-system-modulating effects. It has also been suggested that vitamin D supplementation plays a role in slowing progression of Parkinson and Alzheimer. The present study is a literature review of articles published on the theme COVID-19, Parkinson and Alzheimer's diseases, and the role played by vitamin D. PUBMED, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases were consulted. Results confirm neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory effects of COVID-19, aggravated in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients, and the important role of vitamin D as a possible therapeutic strategy. Nevertheless, randomized controlled trials and large population studies are still warranted.;"https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2020-0074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185582/";12/11/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9589

To stop and control the rapid infection of COVID-19 lockdown is the best option. Sudden lockdown implies change in entire lifestyle of the population. Social isolation affects individual's lives by greater reduction in their physical activity, which might increase chance of infection by reducing the immunity. To what extent, the physical activity is reduced during this lockdown period among physiotherapy professionals and students who propagate physical activity is not known. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity level and energy utilization among physiotherapy professionals and students.

877;Corticosteroid treatment in severe COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.;10.1172/jci140617;BACKGROUNDCorticosteroids are widely used in patients with COVID 19, although their benefit-to-risk ratio remains controversial.METHODSPatients with severe COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were included from December 29, 2019 to March 16, 2020 in 5 tertiary Chinese hospitals. Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analyses were conducted to analyze the impact of corticosteroids on mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, respectively. We performed a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to control confounding factors.RESULTSOf 774 eligible patients, 409 patients received corticosteroids, with a median time from hospitalization to starting corticosteroids of 1.0 day (IQR 0.0-3.0 days) . As compared with usual care, treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased rate of myocardial (15.6% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.041) and liver injury (18.3% vs. 9.9%, P = 0.001), of shock (22.0% vs. 12.6%, P < 0.001), of need for mechanical ventilation (38.1% vs. 19.5%, P < 0.001), and increased rate of 28-day all-cause mortality (44.3% vs. 31.0%, P < 0.001). After PS matching, corticosteroid therapy was associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.13, P = 0.045). High dose (>200 mg) and early initiation (≤3 days from hospitalization) of corticosteroid therapy were associated with a higher 28-day mortality rate. Corticosteroid use was also associated with a delay in SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance in the competing risk analysis (subhazard ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.17-2.15, P = 0.003).CONCLUSIONAdministration of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19-related ARDS is associated with increased 28-day mortality and delayed SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance after adjustment for time-varying confounders.FUNDINGNone.;"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci140617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141117/";03/11/2020;acute respiratory distress syndrome;0.9168
878;A worldwide survey on proctological practice during COVID‐19 lockdown (ProctoLock 2020): a cross‐sectional analysis;10.1111/codi.15394;"AIM: Proctology is one of the surgical specialties that has suffered the most during COVID‐19 pandemic. Using a cross‐sectional non‐incentivised World Wide Web survey, we aimed to snapshot the current status of proctological practice in six world regions. METHOD: Surgeons affiliated to renowned scientific societies with an interest in coloproctology were invited to join the survey. Members of the ProctoLock Working Group enhanced recruitment by direct invitation. The predictive power of respondents’ and hospitals’ demographics on the change of status of surgical and outpatient activities was calculated. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 1050) were mostly men (79%), with a mean age of 46.9 years, at consultant level (79%), practising in academic hospitals (53%) offering a dedicated proctology service (68%). A total of 119 (11%) tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. The majority (54%) came from Europe. Participants from Asia reported a higher proportion of unaltered practice (17%), while those from Europe had the highest proportion of fully stopped practice (20%). The likelihood of ongoing surgical practice was higher in men (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.13–2.09; P = 0.006), in those reporting readily availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) (OR 1.40, 1.08–1.42; P = 0.012) and in centres that were partially or not at all involved in COVID‐19 care (OR 2.95, 2.14–4.09; P < 0.001). This chance decreased by 2% per year of respondent’s age (P = 0.001).

879;COVID‐19 and hypertension—evidence and practical management: Guidance from the HOPE Asia Network;10.1111/jch.13917;There are several risk factors for worse outcomes in patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID‐19). Patients with hypertension appear to have a poor prognosis, but there is no direct evidence that hypertension increases the risk of new infection or adverse outcomes independent of age and other risk factors. There is also concern about use of renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors due to a key role of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 receptors in the entry of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus into cells. However, there is little evidence that use of RAS inhibitors increases the risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 virus infection or worsens the course of COVID‐19. Therefore, antihypertensive therapy with these agents should be continued. In addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, patients with severe COVID‐19 can develop myocardial injury and cytokine storm, resulting in heart failure, arteriovenous thrombosis, and kidney injury. Troponin, N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide, D‐dimer, and serum creatinine are biomarkers for these complications and can be used to monitor patients with COVID‐19 and for risk stratification. Other factors that need to be incorporated into patient management strategies during the pandemic include regular exercise to maintain good health status and monitoring of psychological well‐being. For the ongoing management of patients with hypertension, telemedicine‐based home blood pressure monitoring strategies can facilitate maintenance of good blood pressure control while social distancing is maintained. Overall, multidisciplinary management of COVID‐19 based on a rapidly growing body of evidence will help ensure the best possible outcomes for patients, including those with risk factors such as hypertension.;"https://doi.org/10.1111/jch.13917; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32643874/";09/07/2020;coronavirus 2019 disease;0.9189
880;Anesthetic management of a patient with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a case report;10.1186/s12871-020-0933-1;"BACKGROUND: As patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) have long expected survival, the incidence of noncardiac surgery in this patient population is increasing. Here, we present the anesthetic management of a patient with a continuous-flow LVAD who underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old man with LVAD was scheduled to undergo VATS because of repeated spontaneous pneumothorax. Generally, patients with these devices have marginal right heart function; therefore, it is important to avoid factors that worsen pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). However, VATS requires one-lung ventilation (OLV) and it tends to cause increase in PVR, leading to right heart failure. In the present case, when the patient was set in a lateral decubitus position and progressive hypoxia was observed during OLV, transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a dilated right ventricle and a temporally flattened interventricular septum, and the central venous pressure increased to approximately 20 mmHg. Because we anticipated deterioration of right heart function, dobutamine and milrinone were administered and/or respirator settings were changed to decrease PVR for maintaining LVAD performance. Finally, resection of a bulla was completed, and the patient was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day 37. CONCLUSIONS: The anesthetic management of a patient with LVAD during VATS is challenging because the possible hemodynamic changes induced by hypoxia associated with OLV affect LVAD performance and right heart function. In our experience, VATS that requires OLV will be well tolerated in a patient with LVAD with preserved right heart function, and a multidisciplinary approach to maintain right heart function will be needed.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6972011/;20/01/2020;left ventricular assist device;0.9722
881;Practical considerations for performing regional anesthesia: lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic;10.1007/s12630-020-01637-0;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 because of its rapid worldwide spread. In the operating room, as part of hospital outbreak response measures, anesthesiologists are required to have heightened precautions and tailor anesthetic practices to individual patients. In particular, by minimizing the many aerosol-generating procedures performed during general anesthesia, anesthesiologists can reduce exposure to patients’ respiratory secretions and the risk of perioperative viral transmission to healthcare workers and other patients. To avoid any airway manipulation, regional anesthesia should be considered whenever surgery is planned for a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patient or any patient who poses an infection risk. Regional anesthesia has benefits of preservation of respiratory function, avoidance of aerosolization and hence viral transmission. This article explores the practical considerations and recommended measures for performing regional anesthesia in this group of patients, focusing on control measures geared towards ensuring patient and staff safety, equipment protection, and infection prevention. By doing so, we hope to address an issue that may have downstream implications in the way we practice infection control in anesthesia, with particular relevance to this new era of emerging infectious diseases and novel pathogens. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not the first, and certainly will not be the last novel virus that will lead to worldwide outbreaks. Having a well thought out regional anesthesia plan to manage these patients in this new normal will ensure the best possible outcome for both the patient and the perioperative management team.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32212103/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01637-0";24/03/2020;Coronavirus disease;0.9664

However, data are scarce concerning the trajectories of severe mental disorders after the end of c‐/m‐ECT. This prospective study investigates the clinical outcome of patients with versus without modifications of their c‐/m‐ECT schedules. METHODS: In the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic, ECT capacities were restricted at many clinics in early 2020. All patients receiving c‐/m‐ECT in March and April 2020 at our department (n = 53, unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) were followed up for six months to investigate the impact of treatment modifications imposed by the pandemic. Based on individual decisions, c‐/m‐ECT was either (a) continued without modification, (b) continued with reduced frequency, or (c) discontinued. RESULTS: Both reduced frequency and discontinuation of c‐/m‐ECT were associated with significant clinical deterioration as measured by CGI‐I (Clinical Global Impression Scale ‐ Global Improvement) during the six‐month follow‐up when compared to the subgroup of patients without any treatment modification (p = 0.005, p = 0.011). Furthermore, patients with discontinued or reduced c‐/m‐ECT showed significantly higher rates of rehospitalizations (p = 0.028) and new acute courses of ECT (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of a heterogeneous and relatively small sample, our study strongly corroborates the effectiveness of c‐/m‐ECT in a real‐world population. Especially, patients with shorter time since index ECT seem to be at high risk for severe clinical deterioration in the case of treatment discontinuation or reduction.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960406/; https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13314";18/05/2021;Clinical Global Impression Scale ‐ Global Improvement;0.9102
883;Structure-Based Identification of Natural Products as SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) Antagonist from Echinacea angustifolia Using Computational Approaches;10.3390/v13020305;Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, continues to be a global threat. The number of cases and deaths will remain escalating due to the lack of effective therapeutic agents. Several studies have established the importance of the viral main protease (M(pro)) in the replication of SARS-CoV-2 which makes it an attractive target for antiviral drug development, including pharmaceutical repurposing and other medicinal chemistry approaches. Identification of natural products with considerable inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial as a rapid and potent alternative with drug-likeness by comparison to de novo antiviral drug discovery approaches. Thereof, we carried out the structure-based screening of natural products from Echinacea-angustifolia, commonly used to prevent cold and other microbial respiratory infections, targeting SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Four natural products namely, Echinacoside, Quercetagetin 7-glucoside, Levan N, Inulin from chicory, and 1,3-Dicaffeoylquinic acid, revealed significant docking energy (>−10 kcal/mol) in the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) catalytic pocket via substantial intermolecular contacts formation against co-crystallized ligand (<−4 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the docked poses of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with selected natural products showed conformational stability through molecular dynamics. Exploring the end-point net binding energy exhibited substantial contribution of Coulomb and van der Waals interactions to the stability of respective docked conformations. These results advocated the natural products from Echinacea angustifolia for further experimental studies with an elevated probability to discover the potent SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) antagonist with higher affinity and drug-likeness.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672054/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020305";15/02/2021;Coronavirus disease-19;0.9683
884;Prone positioning of non-intubated patients with COVID-19 - A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis;10.1101/2020.10.12.20211748;"Purpose: Several studies have reported adopting prone positioning (PP) in non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related hypoxaemic respiratory failure. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of PP on oxygenation and clinical outcomes. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and COVID-19 living systematic review from December1st 2019 to July23rd 2020. We included studies that reported using PP in hypoxaemic, non-intubated adult COVID-19 patients. Primary outcome measure was the weighted mean difference (MD) in oxygenation parameters (PaO2/FiO2, PaO2 or SpO2) pre and post-PP. Results: Fifteen single arm observational studies reporting PP in 449 patients were included. Substantial heterogeneity was noted in terms of, location within hospital where PP was instituted, respiratory supports, frequency and duration of PP. Significant improvement in oxygenation was reported post-PP: PaO2/FiO2, (MD 37.6, 95%CI 18.8, 56.5); PaO2, , (MD 30.4 mmHg, 95%CI 10.9, 49.9); and SpO2, (MD 5.8%, 95%CI 3.7, 7.9). Patients with a pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 [≤]150 experienced greater oxygenation improvements compared with those with a pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 >150 (MD 40.5, 95%CI -3.5, 84.6) vs. 37, 95%CI 17.1, 56.9). Respiratory rate decreased post-PP (MD -2.9, 95%CI -5.4, -0.4). Overall intubation and mortality rates were 21% (90/426) and 26% (101/390) respectively. No major adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Despite significant variability in frequency and duration of PP and respiratory supports, PP was associated with improvements in oxygenation parameters without any reported serious adverse events. Major limitation being lack of control arm and adjustment for confounders. Clinical trials are required to determine the effect of awake PP on patient-centred outcomes.";"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.12.20211748; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211748v1?rss=1";14/10/2020;hypoxaemic respiratory failure;0.9063
885;Substance Use Disorders in Recently Hospitalized Patients With Cirrhosis.;10.1097/adm.0000000000000677;OBJECTIVES Cirrhosis is often a consequence of substance use disorders (SUD) and can lead to significant morbidity, mortality, and hospitalizations. We aimed to determine presence and impact of SUD in recently hospitalized patients with cirrhosis, which has not been previously described. METHODS This is a retrospective study of consecutive patients with cirrhosis seen at a post-discharge hepatology clinic. The presence of clinically-recognized SUD and documented establishment of addiction treatment, as noted in routine clinical care, was determined through medical record review. Number of hospitalizations, 30-day readmissions, and all-cause mortality at 1 year were also examined. RESULTS Among 99 patients, 72% were male and the median age was 55 years. The most common etiologies of cirrhosis were alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C infection. Alcohol use disorder was documented in 71%. Nearly all patients with clinically-recognized SUD underwent social work evaluation during hospitalization and 65% were referred to addiction treatment. Establishment of addiction care at follow up was documented in 35%. Documented SUD was associated with greater odds of hospitalization over 1 year (adjusted odds ratio 5.77, 95% confidence interval [1.36, 24.49], P = 0.017), but not with 30-day readmissions or mortality. CONCLUSIONS Clinically-recognized SUD was common in recently hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and associated with at least 1 other hospitalization within a year. Establishment of addiction treatment was documented in only a minority of patients. Further research is needed to determine whether patients with cirrhosis and SUD experience unique barriers to addiction treatment and if integration of SUD care in hepatology settings may be beneficial.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530887/";09/06/2020;substance use disorders;0.9212
886;Hematological Parameters Predict Disease Severity and Progression in Patients with COVID-19: a Review Article.;10.7754/clin.lab.2020.200655;BACKGROUND In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of no identifiable cause had been widely spreading in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. In late December 2019, the pathogen was identified as a new strain of coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its associated disease, named Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). As of July 3, 2020, 10,906,822 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 522,112 deaths, as reported by the World Health Organization. Given the developing situation with COVID-19, extensive studies are urgently needed that determine indicators of severity to provide evidence for health policymakers. This study aimed to review the currently available data on hematological parameters to predict disease severity in patients of COVID-19. METHODS We performed a review using three electronic databases. Fourteen papers are included. In this review, we summarized the latest research highlighting the clinical features, pathogenesis, and diagnosis, with a concentration on hematological parameters that predict severity to help identify patients with severe disease. These indicators will help doctors know earlier which patients may need intensive care unit (ICU) care to manage their patients with an evidence-based protocol. RESULTS Most reviewed studies report hematological parameters that predict disease severity, including lymphopenia and elevated fibrin fragment D. CONCLUSIONS We recommend using these indicators in addition to others, like respiratory failure, shock, or multiple organs dysfunction syndrome, for disease classification in situations where there are insufficient ventilators or ICU beds to prioritize advanced medical services accordingly and to ensure the maximum provision of sufficient medical care.;"https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.200655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33491422/";01/01/2021;Coronavirus disease-19;0.9843
887;COVID-19 pandemic—Environmental perspective of COVID-19 and a primer for all of us;10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1055_20;Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) spread worldwide has created a global pandemic. To reduce the transmission of the virus, the Indian government had imposed a countrywide lockdown on 24 Mar 2020 by suspending all public transport and industries temporarily resulting in loss of jobs in multiple sectors and looming threats to the nation economy. Lockdown on the opposite hand has removed pollutants from the air and thus improved air quality in many cities across the globe. The near-total shutdown of all economic activities except related to essential commodities like medicine and food was only allowed which resulted in the lowering of carbon emission and improvement in global warming and air pollution. This review article indented to bring important features of how the COVID-19 pandemic affects human civilization and the global environment. However, its epidemiology, symptom, possible prevention, and management will briefly describe. Authors have collected data from, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, WHO, and CDC (USA). Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is a result of COVID- 19 infection. This virus is transmitted through close contact by respiratory droplets from one person to another. The majority of symptoms of COVID-19 are very much similar to any viral upper respiratory tract infection ( Common Coryza). Any person with the slightest suspicion or has respiratory symptoms related to COVID-19 infection should wear a facemask, keep safe social distancing, observe cough/sneeze etiquettes. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us a lesson to introspect the way humans are destroying the environment for their benefit. Whatever be the origin or cause, the occurrence of COVID-19 has made a foreground for us to improve the symbiotic relationship between humans, wildlife, and nature.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017702/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1055_20";30/01/2021;Coronavirus Disease;0.9767
888;SARS-CoV-2 lethality decreased over time in two Italian Provinces;10.1101/2020.05.23.20110882;"Background Some experts recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 lethality decreased considerably, but no evidence is yet available. This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 case-fatality rate decreased with time, adjusting for main potential confounders. Methods and findings We included all SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects diagnosed in Ferrara and Pescara provinces, Italy. Information were collected from local registries, clinical charts, and electronic health records. We compared the case-fatality rate of the subjects diagnosed during April and March, 2020. We used Cox proportional hazards analysis and random-effect logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, type II diabetes, major cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), cancer and renal disease. The sample included 1946 subjects (mean age 58.8y; 45.7% males). 177 persons deceased, after a mean of 11.7 days of follow-up. From March to April, the case-fatality rate significantly decreased in the total sample (10.8% versus 6.0%; p<0.001), and in any subgroup of patients. Large reductions of the lethality were observed among the elderly (from 30.0% to 13.4%), and subjects with hypertension (23.0% to 12.1%), diabetes (30.3% to 8.4%), CVD (31.5% to 12.1%), COPD (29.7% to 11.4%), and renal disease (32.3% to 11.5%). In April, the adjusted hazard ratio of death was 0.42 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.29-0.60). The mean age of those who died substantially increased from March (77.9y) to April (86.9y). Conclusions In this sample, SARS-CoV-2 case-fatality rate decreased considerably over time, supporting recent claims of a substantial improvement of SARS-CoV-2 clinical management.

889;Unpacking the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: identifying structural domains;10.1080/20008198.2021.1932296;"Background: The novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a collective crisis that imposed an abrupt and unprecedented impact on college students, as universities were closed with little warning. Paired with the challenges associated with physical distancing (e.g. economic stress, job loss, food insecurity, housing challenges) and the simultaneous need to balance continued and new academic demands, impact will be wide-ranging. It is critical to determine the structure of the impact of this heterogeneous stressor (e.g. health concerns, pandemic worry, financial concerns) for prevention and intervention planning. Objective: Through an existing recruitment pipeline we were in a unique position to study the wide-ranging reach of this pandemic in a cohort of students for whom their university experiences were like no other cohort in history. Method: Data were collected from students who were in their third year of college during the onset of the pandemic; of the N = 1,899 in the cohort who were invited to participate in this COVID-related survey, 897 (47.2%) completed measures of impact between May and July of 2020. Results: A series of confirmatory and exploratory models were fit to examine the structure of the pandemic-related domains. Following estimation of a single-factor model, a correlated five factors model, as well as two second-order factor structures, the five correlated factors (exposure, worry, housing/food instability, social media, substance use) model was found to represent the data most appropriately, while producing an interpretable solution. Conclusions: These measurement model analyses set the stage for future research to examine how these correlated factors impact psychiatric, substance, and academic outcomes in this vulnerable population.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8231405/;24/06/2021;coronavirus-19;0.9073
890;Abnormal rich club organization in end-stage renal disease patients before dialysis initiation and undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.;10.1186/s12882-020-02176-y;BACKGROUND End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at a substantially higher risk for developing cognitive impairment compared with the healthy population. Dialysis is an essential way to maintain the life of ESRD patients. Based on previous research, there isn't an uncontested result whether cognition was improved or worsened during dialysis. METHODS To explore the impact of dialysis treatment on cognitive performance, we recruited healthy controls (HCs), predialysis ESRD patients (predialysis group), and maintenance hemodialysis ESRD patients (HD group). All ESRD patients performed six blood biochemistry tests (hemoglobin, urea, cystatin C, Na+, K+, and parathyroid hormone). Neuropsychological tests were used to measure cognitive function. By using diffusion tensor imaging and graph-theory approaches, the topological organization of the whole-brain structural network was investigated. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were performed to investigate blood biochemistry predictors of the neuropsychological tests and the results of graph analyses in the HD group and predialysis group. RESULTS Neuropsychological analysis showed the HD group exhibited better cognitive function than the predialysis group, but both were worse than HCs. Whole-brain graph analyses revealed that increased global efficiency and normalized shortest path length remained in the predialysis group and HD group than the HCs. Besides, a lower normalized clustering coefficient was found in the predialysis group relative to the HCs and HD group. For the GLM analysis, only the Cystatin C level was significantly associated with the average fiber length of rich club connections in the predialysis group. CONCLUSIONS Our study revealed that dialysis had a limited effect on cognitive improvement.;"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-020-02176-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243163/";26/11/2020;End-stage renal disease;0.91
891;Barriers to and Facilitators of User Engagement With Digital Mental Health Interventions: Systematic Review;10.2196/24387;BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), which deliver mental health support via technologies such as mobile apps, can increase access to mental health support, and many studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving symptoms. However, user engagement varies, with regard to a user’s uptake and sustained interactions with these interventions. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to identify common barriers and facilitators that influence user engagement with DMHIs. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in the SCOPUS, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Empirical studies that report qualitative and/or quantitative data were included. RESULTS: A total of 208 articles met the inclusion criteria. The included articles used a variety of methodologies, including interviews, surveys, focus groups, workshops, field studies, and analysis of user reviews. Factors extracted for coding were related to the end user, the program or content offered by the intervention, and the technology and implementation environment. Common barriers included severe mental health issues that hampered engagement, technical issues, and a lack of personalization. Common facilitators were social connectedness facilitated by the intervention, increased insight into health, and a feeling of being in control of one’s own health. CONCLUSIONS: Although previous research suggests that DMHIs can be useful in supporting mental health, contextual factors are important determinants of whether users actually engage with these interventions. The factors identified in this review can provide guidance when evaluating DMHIs to help explain and understand user engagement and can inform the design and development of new digital interventions.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8074985/;24/03/2021;Digital mental health interventions;0.9104
892;Stakeholder views on the acceptability of human infection studies in Malawi;10.1186/s12910-020-0454-y;BACKGROUND: Human infection studies (HIS) are valuable in vaccine development. Deliberate infection, however, creates challenging questions, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) where HIS are new and ethical challenges may be heightened. Consultation with stakeholders is needed to support contextually appropriate and acceptable study design. We examined stakeholder perceptions about the acceptability and ethics of HIS in Malawi, to inform decisions about planned pneumococcal challenge research and wider understanding of HIS ethics in LMICs. METHODS: We conducted 6 deliberative focus groups and 15 follow-up interviews with research staff, medical students, and community representatives from rural and urban Blantyre. We also conducted 5 key informant interviews with clinicians, ethics committee members, and district health government officials. RESULTS: Stakeholders perceived HIS research to have potential population health benefits, but they also had concerns, particularly related to the safety of volunteers and negative community reactions. Acceptability depended on a range of conditions related to procedures for voluntary and informed consent, inclusion criteria, medical care or support, compensation, regulation, and robust community engagement. These conditions largely mirror those in existing guidelines for HIS and biomedical research in LMICs. Stakeholder perceptions pointed to potential tensions, for example, balancing equity, safety, and relevance in inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest HIS research could be acceptable in Malawi, provided certain conditions are in place. Ongoing assessment of participant experiences and stakeholder perceptions will be required to strengthen HIS research during development and roll-out.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7003337/;05/02/2020;Human infection studies;0.9049
893;Computational drug repurposing study of the RNA binding domain of SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleocapsid protein with antiviral agents;10.1002/btpr.3110;The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) in China caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has led to worldwide human infections and deaths. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronaviruses (CoVs) is a multifunctional RNA binding protein necessary for viral RNA replication and transcription. Therefore, it is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. This study addresses the potential to repurpose antiviral compounds approved or in development for treating human CoV induced infections against SARS‐CoV‐2 N. For this purpose, we used the docking methodology to better understand the inhibitory mechanism of this protein with the existing 34 antiviral compounds. The results of this analysis indicate that rapamycin, saracatinib, camostat, trametinib, and nafamostat were the top hit compounds with binding energy (−11.87, −10.40, −9.85, −9.45, −9.35 kcal/mol, respectively). This analysis also showed that the most common residues that interact with the compounds are Phe66, Arg68, Gly69, Tyr123, Ile131, Trp132, Val133, and Ala134. Subsequently, protein‐ligand complex stability was examined with molecular dynamics simulations for these five compounds, which showed the best binding affinity. According to the results of this study, the interaction between these compounds and crucial residues of the target protein were maintained. These results suggest that these residues are potential drug targeting sites for the SARS‐CoV‐2 N protein. This study information will contribute to the development of novel compounds for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS‐CoV‐2, as well as possible new drug repurposing strategies to treat COVID‐19 disease.;"https://doi.org/10.1002/btpr.3110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33314794/";30/12/2020;coronavirus disease;0.9726
894;Information and communication technology to enhance continuing professional development (CPD) and continuing medical education (CME) for Rwanda: a scoping review of reviews;10.1186/s12909-021-02607-w;BACKGROUND: Access to high quality continuing professional development (CPD) is necessary for healthcare professionals to retain competency within the ever-evolving worlds of medicine and health. Most low- and middle-income countries, including Rwanda, have a critical shortage of healthcare professionals and limited access to CPD opportunities. This study scoped the literature using review articles related to the use of information and communication technology (ICT) and video conferencing for the delivery of CPD to healthcare professionals. The goal was to inform decision-makers of relevant and suitable approaches for a low-income country such as Rwanda. METHODS: PubMed and hand searching was used. Only review articles written in English, published between 2010 and 2019, and reporting the use of ICT for CPD were included. RESULTS: Six review articles were included in this study. Various delivery modes (face to face, pure elearning and blended learning) and technology approaches (Internet-based and non-Internet based) were reported. All types of technology approach enhanced knowledge, skills and attitudes. Pure elearning is comparable to face-to-face delivery and better than ‘no intervention’, and blended learning showed mixed results compared to traditional face-to-face learning. Participant satisfaction was attributed to ease of use, easy access and interactive content. CONCLUSION: The use of technology to enhance CPD delivery is acceptable with most technology approaches improving knowledge, skills and attitude. For the intervention to work effectively, CPD courses must be well designed: needs-based, based on sound educational theories, interactive, easy to access, and affordable. Participants must possess the required devices and technological literacy.;"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926419/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02607-w";29/04/2021;Access to high quality continuing professional development;0.9622
895;Findings from Cardiovascular Evaluation of NCAA Division I Collegiate Student-Athletes after Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection;10.1101/2021.01.07.21249407;Objectives: The risk of myocardial damage after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been controversial. There is an urgent need for data to support the appropriate level of cardiovascular screening for safe return-to-play. The purpose of this study is to report the incidence of abnormal cardiovascular findings in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I student-athletes with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: This is a case series of student-athletes at a single NCAA Division I institution who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody testing (IgG) from 4/15/2020 to 10/31/2020. From 452 athletes who were screened, 5,124 PCR and 452 antibody tests were completed. Student-athletes were followed through 12/31/2020 (median 104 days, range 64-182 days). Cardiac work-up included clinical evaluation, troponin level, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiogram. Additional work-up was ordered as clinically indicated. Results: 55 student-athletes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 38 (69%) had symptoms of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), 14 (26%) had a positive IgG test, and 41 (74%) had a positive PCR test. Eight abnormal cardiovascular screening evaluations necessitated further testing including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Two athletes received new cardiac diagnoses, one probable early cardiomyopathy and one pericarditis, while the remaining six had normal cardiac MRIs. Conclusion: These data support recent publications which recommend the de-escalation of cardiovascular testing for athletes who have recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Continued follow-up of these athletes for sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 is critical.;"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.07.21249407; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249407v1?rss=1";08/01/2021;Coronavirus Disease;0.9981
896;Nonsurgical Rhinoplasty: A Systematic Review of Technique, Outcomes, and Complications.;10.1097/prs.0000000000006892;BACKGROUND Nonsurgical rhinoplasty using filler injections has become a common procedure in cosmetic practices. This is offered to patients that prefer a temporary outcome or would like to avoid general anesthesia. In addition, it can be used in postrhinoplasty patients to correct nasal deformities or irregularities. This systematic review highlights common filler types and injection techniques, and associated patient satisfaction and complications to further guide practitioners. METHODS A systematic review was performed using keywords and Medical Subject Headings search terms. PubMed, EmBase, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched using the appropriate search terms. Data collected from each study included patient satisfaction and complications, in addition to injection material, location, and technique. RESULTS Four thousand six hundred thirty-two studies were found based on search criteria. After full-text screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23 studies were included. A total of 1600 patients underwent nonsurgical rhinoplasty, most commonly with hyaluronic acid (73.38 percent), followed by calcium hydroxyapatite (12.44 percent). Nearly 95 percent of patients were satisfied with results, and there were only 26 relatively minor complications reported. There were no reports of vascular complications such as skin necrosis or visual compromise. CONCLUSIONS Based on the authors' review of the literature, nonsurgical rhinoplasty is an effective temporary alternative to traditional augmentation rhinoplasty for corrections of nasal shape with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Complications may be underreported, and thus further investigation is needed to better understand the true incidence of major complications related to vascular compromise.;"https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000006892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32590640/";01/07/2020;Nonsurgical rhinoplasty;0.906
